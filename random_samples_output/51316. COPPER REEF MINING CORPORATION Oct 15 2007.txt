1 SUMMARY 
Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) was retained by Bob 

Nylen, President and CEO of Foran Mining Corporation (Foran), to prepare an 

independent Technical Report on the McIlvenna Bay Project, near Hanson Lake in 

northeastern Saskatchewan.  The purpose of this report is to provide an updated technical 

report and a mineral resource estimate for the property.  This Technical Report conforms 

to National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).  

Scott Wilson RPA visited the property on September 26, 2006 and spent September 27-

29 in the Foran facilities in Saskatoon looking at data and drill core from a number of 

holes. 

 

Foran is involved in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral 

properties and is currently focused on the development of their gold and base metal 

properties located in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  This report deals with the 

McIlvenna Bay Project, a Zn-Cu volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit which is at the 

advanced exploration stage. The major asset of the property is a large body of Cu-Zn 

mineralization for which there is an historic resource estimate that is not compliant with 

NI 43-101. 

 

In 1990, Scott Wilson RPA, then known as Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA), did 

a resource estimate on this property for Billiton Metals Canada Inc.  

 
CONCLUSIONS 

A significant mineral resource has been estimated for the McIlvenna Bay property as 

summarized in Table 1-3.  Indicated resources total 6,671,000 t at a grade of 0.87% Cu, 

6.51% Zn, and 26.0 g/t Ag.  Inferred resources total 6,000,000 t at a grade of 0.83% Cu, 

5.89% Zn, and 24.8 g/t Ag.  These numbers differ from the historic resource estimation 

by Foran in 2000. Due to the more erratic nature of the copper mineralization in the 

copper stringer zone, the use of an arbitrary cut-off grade for interpretation was not 

appropriate.  The geological boundaries and entire intersection in each drill hole in this 

zone were used instead.  As well, a minimum width of three metres was imposed on all 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 1-2

zones where the previous interpretation included the occasional narrow intersection for 

the sake of continuity. 

 

The higher cut-off value used by Scott Wilson RPA eliminates much of the Copper 

Stringer zone from either category. 

 

More fill in diamond drilling is required to upgrade the mineral resources and to trace 

their extension down plunge to the northwest. 

 

Given the advanced stage of this project, it would be reasonable to carry out a 

preliminary assessment/scoping study after the completion of the next phase of drilling. 

 
RECOMMENDATIONS 

A nine hole, 9,600 m drilling program is recommended as outlined in the budget in 

Table 1-1. The pierce points of the proposed holes are shown on the Longitudinal 

Section, Figure 20-1. The purpose of the drilling is to tighten up drill hole spacings so 

that the mineral resources might be upgraded and to explore the down plunge extension 

of the McIlvenna Bay sulphide deposit (to the northwest). Upon completion of the 

proposed drilling, the current mineral resource estimate should be updated and a 

preliminary assessment/scoping study carried out. 

 

Contingent on the results of the preliminary assessment, a Phase 2 drilling program 

should be considered to acquire mineralized material for metallurgical test work. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA recommends that a rigorous program of QA/QC be instituted for 

the next phase of drilling.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 
PROPERTY DESCRIPTION, LOCATION, LAND TENURE 

The McIlvenna Bay deposit occurs within Foran's Hanson Lake property which 

comprises 26 claims totaling 12,950 ha. Located approximately one kilometre south of 

Hanson Lake, Saskatchewan, the property is also approximately 375 km northeast of 

Saskatoon and 65 km west-southwest of Flin Flon, Manitoba. The McIlvena Bay deposit 

is located within NTS sheet 63L10 and the plan projection of the deposit is centered on 

UTM 640,600 E and 6,056,800 N (NAD 83, Zone 13).  The corresponding geographic 

coordinates are 102o50' W and 54o38" N.   

 

The claims are all in good standing and are held in the name of Foran Mining 

Corporation.

On January 25, 2005, Foran announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement 

with Cameco Corporation (Cameco) and Billiton Metals Canada Inc (BHP Billiton), 

collectively the Hanson Lake Joint Venture, which allowed Foran to acquire a 100% 

interest in the Hanson Lake property (McIlvenna Bay Cu-Zn deposit).  Foran would 

acquire 100% of the Hanson Lake property by:  

 i) paying C$1,500,000 to the Hanson Lake Joint Venture  
 ii) paying a further C$2,000,000 to the Hanson Lake Joint Venture before May 

31, 2006; and  

 iii) providing the Hanson Lake Joint Venture with a 1% Net Smelter Return 
(NSR), with a buy-out provision in favour of Foran for the purchase of the whole 
NSR for Cdn.$1,000,000 at any time.  

 

In subsequent agreements with Copper Reef Mines Ltd., newly named Copper Reef 

Mining Corporation (Copper Reef), a private company organized under the laws of 

Manitoba, Foran organized the finances to fulfill the terms of the agreement with the 

Hanson Lake Joint Venture. As a result, Copper Reef has been assigned a 25% interest in 

the property, Foran retains a 75% interest and the two have entered into a joint venture 

for the purpose of developing the property. 

 

The property, which is accessible by an all weather road, has no infrastructure other 

than a camp building and a core storage yard. 

 
HISTORY 

In 1987, Cameco flew a Mark VI helicopter INPUT survey over the area south of 

Hanson Lake, with flight lines oriented NE-SW.  The survey delineated a 1,200 m long 

INPUT anomaly, striking east-south-east, 1 km south of McIlvenna Bay. 

 

In January 1988, a ground magnetometer and HLEM survey defined the anomaly and 

six holes were subsequently drilled into what is now the McIlvenna Bay deposit. From 

1989 to 1991, an additional 61 drill holes were completed.  Fifty-six of the holes were 

drilled to test the deposit, of which only five failed to intersect economically significant 

mineralization.  In 1991, Cameco suspended exploration activities at the Hanson Lake 

property and it remained idle until optioned in 1998 by Foran Mining Corporation.

As of May 31, 2000, Foran drilled 59 additional holes totaling 33,350 m into the 

property, with 57 holes directly testing the deposit.  The first 44 holes were drilled with 

the objective of upgrading the quality of the resource to a depth of 580 m from the 

Inferred Resource Category to the Indicated Resource Category.  The last 15 holes were 

drilled below the plunge line and down plunge of the deposit and extended the deposit an 

additional 300 m vertically below the plunge of the previous resource base. 

 

The most recent estimate, with the largest drill database, was completed by R. 

Lemaitre of M'Ore Exploration Services in June 2000, after the completion of Foran's 

44-hole infill drilling program. This block model resource estimate was based on a total 

of 63,344 m of diamond drilling from 124 holes, of which 33,350 m of drilling was 

completed by Foran between December 1998 and May 2000. Cut-off grades of 1.5% 

copper or 4.0% zinc were used. The area between L93+00E and L103+50E and above the 

580 m vertical depth was deemed to have been drilled at sufficient intersection spacings 

to be classified as an Indicated Resource.  The remainder of the mineralization delineated 

to a maximum depth of 1,230 m vertical is classified as Inferred Resources. Estimated 

resources are listed in Table 1-2.

This resource estimate was independently audited by Watts, Griffis, and McOuat who 

overall, concurred with the block modelling results and concluded that the modelling 

procedures and categorization were completed according to industry standards.

Scott Wilson RPA has also closely reviewed the previous Foran resource estimate and 

agrees that, except for the Copper Stringer zone, the block modelling methodology, 

results and classification are acceptable and comply with industry standards. 

 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The Hanson Lake property is located on the western edge of the Early Proterozoic 

Flin Flon Greenstone Belt (FFGB) which extends from north central Manitoba into 

northeastern Saskatchewan. The FFGB forms part of the Reindeer Zone, a subdivision of 

the Trans-Hudson Orogen, a continental-scale tectonic event which occurred 

approximately between 1.84 Ga and 1.80 Ga as a result of the collision between the 

Superior and Hearne Archean Cratons. 

 

The FFGB is composed of structurally juxtaposed volcanic and sedimentary 

assemblages that were emplaced in a variety of tectonic environments. The major 1.92-

1.88 Ga components include aerially significant juvenile arc and juvenile ocean-floor 

rocks, and minor ocean plateau/ocean island basalt. The juvenile arc assemblage 

comprises tholeiitic, calc-alkaline, and lesser shoshonitic and boninitic rocks similar in 

major and trace element geochemistry to modern intra-oceanic arcs. Ocean-floor basalt 

sequences are exclusively tholeiitic, and are geochemically similar to modern N- and E- 

type MORBs erupted in back-arc basins. Evolved arc assemblages and Archean crustal 

slices are present within the FFGB as minor components. 

 

As currently viewed, the Flin Flon Greenstone Belt contains eight geographically-

separate juvenile island arc volcanic assemblages (blocks), each of which is 20 km to 50 

km across.  From east to west, they are known as the Snow Lake, Four Mile Island, 

Sheridon, Flin Flon, Birch Lake, West Amisk, Hanson Lake, and Northern Lights 

Assemblages. These assemblages are separated by major structural features and/or areas 

of differing tectonostratigraphic origin.  It is unclear whether the eight juvenile arc 

sequences represent different island arcs, or segments of a larger continuous arc.  Within 

the belt, each tectonostratigraphic block has been broken into several sub-blocks, usually 

bounded by local to regional fault systems.  Correlation of stratigraphy between sub-

blocks is difficult to impossible to determine. 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 1-7

The exposed portion of the FFGB is approximately 250 km in an EW direction by 75 

km NS.  To the north, it is in tectonic contact with gneissic metasedimentary, 

metavolcanic and plutonic rocks of the Kisseynew Domain. To the south, it is overlain by 

flat lying to southerly dipping Ordovician platformal cover rocks.  

 
LOCAL GEOLOGY 

The Hanson Lake Block, the host terrain of the McIlvenna Bay Deposit, is bound to 

the east by the Sturgeon-Weir Shear Zone and to the west by the Tabbernor Fault Zone.  

The block extends an unknown distance to the south beneath a nearly flat-lying cover of 

Ordovician sandstones of the Winnipeg Formation, and dolomites of the Red River 

Formation.  

 

In the Hanson Lake area, north of the Paleozoic margin, the exposed Proterozoic 

rocks of the Hanson Lake Block are dominated by juvenile island arc, felsic to 

intermediate metavolcanic rocks, with subordinate amounts of mafic volcanics, minor 

intermediate volcanics, and greywackes.  Oxide facies iron formations are not commonly 

exposed but their presence has been confirmed by diamond drilling.  The sequence has 

been intruded by various felsic intrusions, some of which are believed to be subvolcanic 

intrusions.  Abundant diorite and gabbro plugs and dykes cut the sequence as well as 

minor ultramafic intrusions. The supracrustal rocks generally dip moderately to steeply 

east to north-east.  South of Hanson Lake, the Proterozoic sequence is poorly understood 

because of the unconformably overlying Paleozoic sedimentary rocks.  The McIlvenna 

Bay Deposit projects to sub-surface under the sedimentary cover.  

 

At least two distinct folding events, both having northerly trending fold axes, have 

influenced the stratigraphy in the Hanson Lake Area. Peak regional metamorphism 

probably reached upper amphibolite facies. At the McIlvenna Bay Deposit, the host rocks 

exhibit a greenschist metamorphic facies which is probably a retrograde event after a 

previous amphibolite grade since relict cordierite, anthophyllite, garnet and andalusite are 

commonly observed in the VMS alteration package. U-Pb age dating of a quartz-feldspar 

porphyry (a possible subvolcanic intrusion) which intruded the supracrustal sequence 

yielded a date of 1888 ± 12 Ma.

PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
Lacking any outcrop in the area of the deposit, the property geology  has been 

interpreted from the drill core record with help from geophysical surveys. 

 

The stratigraphy of the deposit area, divided into six formations, has been defined 

over a two kilometre strike length by a total of 124 drill holes. The lowest formation 

intersected by drilling both structurally and stratigraphically is the McIlvenna Bay 

Formation. This is comprised of a minimum 200 m thickness of variably altered felsic 

volcanics, volcaniclastics and/or volcanic-derived sediments of rhyolitic composition. 

The massive and semi-massive sulphide deposits are part of this formation. The 

McIlvenna Bay Formation is overlain to the north by the Cap Tuffite Formation, a 

sequence of intercalated felsic volcanic and cherty metasediments which have been 

intruded by sills and dykes of the Davies Gabbro (described below).  The unit ranges 

from 35 m to 55 m thick, is finely banded to finely laminated and ranges from white to 

cream to grey-green in colour. An east to west zonation is observed in the Cap Tuffite 

from cherty-dominated in the east to rhyolitic-dominated in the west. Stratigraphically 

overlying the Cap Tuffite is the Koziol Iron Formation, a long continuous exhalative 

horizon traceable in drill core and by geophysics over several kilometres and as such, an 

excellent stratigraphic marker horizon.  The unit is a true oxide-facies iron formation that 

ranges from 0.1 m to 25 m true thickness and is composed of 1 cm to 5 cm thick bands of 

fine-grained chert, interbedded with 1 mm to 50 mm massive magnetite bands and 1 cm 

to 1 m thick massive grunerite±garnet±magnetite ±chlorite  bands.  Overlying the Koziol 

Formation is the Rusk Formation, a thick package of massive and calcite-altered mafic 

volcanic rocks that are approximately 100 m thick.  The mafic rocks are likely massive 

flows, although the thickness of individual flow units cannot be determined from drill 

core. Topping the Rusk Formation is another exhalative horizon, the HW-A Formation 

which ranges from 1 cm to 5 m thick and shows a transition from west to east from 

oxide-facies iron formation to massive sphalerite-pyrite. Overlying the iron formation 

portion is a 1 m to10 m thick massive mafic volcanic unit. Overlying the 10 cm to 75 cm 

thick sphalerite-pyrite layer is a 5 m to 15 m thick massive, grey, felsic volcanic unit.  

Overlying the HW-A Formation is +400 m thick Upper Sequence, a bimodal package of 

volcanic units that have been difficult to correlate from hole to hole.  Approximately 45% 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 1-9

of the unit is composed of aphanitic, grey, felsic volcanic, and 50% fine-grained mafic 

volcanic rocks.  Some of the mafic units may be gabbroic intrusions.  Approximately 5% 

of the unit is composed of greywackes and at least two additional oxide-facies iron 

formation horizons.  The Davies Gabbro, a plug up to 100 m thick east of the deposit, 

extends westward toward the centre of the sulphide body where it narrows into a series of 

thin dykes.  The gabbro appears to be a series of sills that have intruded along the 

bedding planes of the Cap Tuffite Formation.  The gabbro plug plunges along an axis 

parallel to the sulphide body and appears to exert some sort of control over the limits of 

mineralization along the bottom plunge line of the deposit. 

 
STRUCTURE 

Stratigraphy in the deposit area strikes between 275o and 295o and dips to the north at 

65o-70o, although in selected areas it dips vertically.  The deposit has the same orientation 

as the stratigraphy and also plunges at approximately 45o to the northwest.  Rocks in the 

host stratigraphy are massive to strongly foliated, the intensity of which depends on the 

competency of each individual unit and the degree of alteration. 

 

Two phases of folding of the host stratigraphy have been observed in the drill core 

and are believed to correspond to the regional F2 and F3 folding events. 

 

Evidence of faulting has been documented in drill core but it is difficult to determine 

the orientation, scale, or continuity of most faults between drill holes with the present 

level of information. 

 
DEPOSIT TYPE AND MINERALIZATION 

The target deposit on the McIlvenna Bay property is a volcanogenic massive sulphide 

(VMS) deposit, a synvolcanic accumulation of sulphide minerals that occur in geological 

environments characterized by submarine volcanic rocks.   

 

The McIlvenna Bay deposit consists of structurally modified, strataform, 

volcanogenic, polymetallic massive sulphide mineralization and associated stringer zone 

mineralization.  The sulphides contain copper and zinc, with low lead and silver and gold

SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 1-10

values. The deposit has undergone strong deformation and upper greenschist to 

amphibolite facies metamorphism.  The sulphide lenses are now attenuated down the 

plunge to the northwest. 

 

The McIlvenna Bay deposit is comprised of five different zones and includes three 

distinct styles of mineralization.  The five zones identified are the Lens 2, the Upper 

West, Lens 3, Lens 4, and the Copper Stringer Zone.  The three different styles of 

mineralization are massive sulphides, semi-massive sulphides, and copper stringers.  

Each style is mineralogically and texturally distinct. 

 

The Lens 2 Massive Sulphide is by far the largest and most significant massive 

sulphide zone in the McIlvenna Bay deposit.  It has a strike length of 400 m to 550 m, 

ranges in true thickness from 0.40 m to 16.75 m and has an average thickness of 5.55 m.  

The zone plunges approximately 45o to the north and strikes at 295o with an average dip 

of 68o.  The zone has been defined from the top of the Proterozoic sequence at a vertical 

depth of 35 m down to a depth of 1,230 m and remains open down plunge. 

 

The Upper West Zone is a relatively copper-gold-enriched semi-massive sulphide 

unit found as a long strip that lies parallel to and along the top of the plunge line of the 

Lens 2 Massive Sulphide. It has a strike length of 150 m to 300 m and has been 

delineated between the vertical depths of 35 m and 1,230 m. It varies from 2.80 m to 

10.60 m true thickness and averages 4.81 m true thickness. The zone remains open down 

plunge below the 1,230 m level. This zone also appears to be one continuous sheet and is 

relatively more copper and gold-rich compared to the Lens 2 Massive Sulphide.   

 

The Lens 3 Massive Sulphide is a discontinuous and generally very thin massive and 

semi-massive sulphide horizon that is located 10 m to 30 m above the Lens 2 and Upper 

West horizon.  The zone has a strike length of 100 m to 350 m and plunges parallel to the 

underlying mineralized zones. The true thickness of the zone ranges from 0.18 m to 6.65 

m and averages 2.39 m.

SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com

The Lens 4 mineralized zone is located approximately 40 m to 50 m below the Upper 

West Zone of the Lens 2 horizon, roughly between coordinates 9300E and 9500E.  The 

zone was intersected in four holes, HA-26, MB-99-107, MB-99-108, and MB-99-118.  In 

hole 107, a large semi-massive interval was intersected, with mineralogy, texture and 

grades similar to that of the Upper West Zone.  The zone is underlain by a thick copper 

stringer zone.   

 

The Copper Stringer Zone underlies and is in contact with the Upper West Zone and 

the western half of the Lens 2 Massive Sulphide.  The zone is wedge-shaped with the 

blunt edge running parallel to the plunge of, and underlying the Upper West Zone.  The 

wedge terminates near the central axis of the Lens 2 Massive Sulphide. The zone is 

thickest underlying the Upper West Zone, where it is considered to be the proximal 

hydrothermal feeder zone for the hydrothermal system which deposited the massive 

sulphides.  Stringer mineralization in this area is hosted in chlorite-altered rock.  To the 

east, immediately underlying the Lens 2 Massive Sulphides, the stringer mineralization is 

hosted in fine fracture networks in silicified and sericitized rock. The zone, which 

contains multiple narrow stringers, has been delineated between the vertical depths of 35 

m and 1,230 m.  The best portion of this zone has a strike length of 300 m to 600 m and 

ranges from 0.57 m to 48.30 m true thickness, averaging 8.08 m.  The stringer zone 

remains open to the west and down plunge below the 930 m level. 

 

The most interesting feature of the deposit is the fact that the Upper West Zone 

remains open down plunge, and likely, both it and the plumbing system underlying it will 

continue at depth.  This possibility should be tested by additional drilling. 

 
DRILLING 

Cameco and Foran employed similar drilling procedures on the McIlvenna Bay 

Project. The top of the holes from surface down through the Paleozoic cover sequence 

was drilled with HQ rods.  The drill string was reduced to NQ for drilling below the 

Proterozoic regolith.  This same procedure was employed by Cameco during their drilling 

program.  All but a handful of the Cameco holes, and all of the Foran holes still have 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 1-12

their HQ rod string in the hole allowing one to locate the holes on surface and to re-enter 

them if necessary. 

 

Down hole surveying of Cameco holes HA-60 through HA-65 was completed using 

acid tests only.  Holes HA-01 through HA-17, and HA-66 and HA-67 were completed 

using Tropari and acid test measurements.  All other Cameco holes were surveyed using 

the Techdel International Light-Log system. 

 

Down hole surveying on all of the Foran holes was done using a combination of 

Tropari measurements and acid tests.  Due to the presence of magnetic rocks in the 

stratigraphy, especially the iron formations, Tropari azimuths were sometimes inaccurate 

and were occasionally ignored in order to get reasonably accurate hole locations.  Tropari 

measurements were taken at approximately 75 m intervals, acid tests were taken every 50 

m. The use of Tropari measurements was considered acceptable for the shorter holes as 

the influence of the one or two iron formation horizons intersected in such holes could be 

eliminated by careful analysis of the Tropari data and logging of the core. However, the 

Tropari instrument was totally inadequate as a surveying tool for the deep, step out holes 

67, 111, 120A, 122, 122W1, 124, and 125. Foran concluded that the locations of the 

intersections of these holes have an estimated error of ±50 m in the east-west direction 

and ±25 m in the vertical direction. A resurvey of many, or all, of the holes with a non-

magnetic down hole instrument may be warranted in the future. 

 
SAMPLING METHOD, SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, SECURITY AND DATA 
VERIFICATION 

For all Foran drill holes, assay samples were generally taken on 1.0 m intervals and 

all sample boundaries respected the geological contacts. Samples smaller than 1.0 m long 

were taken when necessary to respect such conditions.  Samples as large as 1.5 m long 

were taken in weakly mineralized copper stringer zone estimated to contain less than 1% 

copper. 

 

All samples were cut in half by diamond saw and one half of the core was submitted 

for assay analysis.  Metal tags with the sample numbers inscribed were stapled into the 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 1-13

box marking the sample boundaries.  Boundary limits were also marked on the core box 

itself to limit any sampling errors.  The unsampled half of the core was kept intact in the 

core box and stored. 

 

Assays taken during the Cameco program were also taken on 1.0 m intervals.  

However, sample boundaries did not respect the Cameco-logged geological contacts in 

several holes. 

 

Statistics on percentage core recovery are not available for either the Foran or 

Cameco drilling campaigns.  From Scott Wilson RPA's examination of core stored in the 

field and in the Saskatoon storage facility, we would estimate that there was perhaps 95% 

to 98% core recovery, at least in the mineralized sections. Hence the sawed/sampled 

material sent for assay should be an accurate reflection of one half of the core and should 

be free of any bias because of the competent nature of the core produced. 

 

The true thickness of any mineralized intercept can only be estimated on those 

sections where the density of drilling is sufficient to determine the boundaries of the 

mineralized zone(s). 

 

For the Cameco work, little information is available for security measures employed, 

quality control or quality assurance procedures, and who actually prepared the samples. 

The samples of sawn core were sent mostly to TSL Assayers in Saskatoon for preparation 

and analyses. The split halves were assayed by standard Atomic Absorption techniques 

for zinc, copper, silver, and lead and by fire assay/atomic absorption finish for gold. 

 

The bulk of the assaying and all sample preparation from the Foran drilling programs 

were also done at TSL Assayers. One in ten samples was check assayed at the 

Saskatchewan Research Council. The QA/QC procedures used by Foran were not as 

rigorous as one might expect in a current program. Nonetheless, Scott Wilson RPA 

believes that the work was done in accordance with the best practices of the time and that 

the results should be reliable.

 1-14

Scott Wilson RPA selected ten samples of quarter split drill core for duplicate 

analyses. With the exception of the copper value for one sample, there was reasonably 

good correlation between the duplicate assays and the original Foran assays.  

 

A comparison of analyses as quoted on original assay certificates to the numbers 

listed in drill logs for specific assay intervals did not locate any serious errors in 

transcription. 

 
MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

Scott Wilson RPA prepared a mineral resource estimate of the McIlvenna Bay deposit 

using digital drill hole data provided by Foran. Scott Wilson RPA interpreted a set of 

cross sections, and also used long sections and plans to construct 3D wireframes of the 

mineralized zones. Variogram parameters were determined separately for each 

mineralized zone.  A block model was interpolated using the kriging and inverse distance 

methods and a mineral resource for copper, zinc, and silver was estimated (Table 1-3).

Using long term metal prices, the in-situ Cu and Zn percent values in each block of 

the block model were converted to US$ amounts.  These cash values for Cu and Zn were 

then converted to a NSR (Net Smelter Return) using ratios of in-situ values to NSR

values for each metal.  The ratios were calculated using the parameters listed, with the Zn 

ratio equal to 0.45 and the copper ratio equalling 0.55.  Silver and gold do not contribute 

any significant value to the NSR and were not included in the calculations. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA classified the mineral resources at McIlvenna Bay in the block 

model into indicated and inferred categories based on drill hole spacing and apparent 

geological and grade continuity of the mineralized zones.  Indicated mineral resources are 

located between L93+00E and L104+00E above the 2,750 m elevation.  Drill hole 

spacing in this area varies from 40 m to 80 m, on 50 m sections.  Inferred mineral 

resources exist below and to the west of the indicated resources along the plunge of the 

deposit.  Drilling in this area is much more irregularly spaced both on and between 

sections. 

 

There are no mineral reserves estimated at McIlvenna Bay at this time.

On January 25, 2005, Foran announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement 

with Cameco and Billiton Metals Canada Inc. (BHP Billiton), collectively the Hanson 

Lake Joint Venture, which allowed Foran to acquire a 100% interest in the Hanson Lake 

property (including the McIlvenna Bay Cu-Zn deposit).  Foran would acquire 100% of 

the Hanson Lake property by:  

 i) paying C$1,500,000 to the Hanson Lake Joint Venture;  
 ii) paying a further C$2,000,000 to the Hanson Lake Joint Venture before May 

31, 2006; and  



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 4-3

 iii) providing the Hanson Lake Joint Venture with a 1% Net Smelter Return 
(NSR), with a buy-out provision in favour of Foran for the purchase of the whole 
NSR for C$1,000,000 at any time.  

 
Foran agreed to assign its interest in the Property Option Agreement between Foran, 

Cameco, and BHP Billiton to Copper Reef Mines Ltd., newly named Copper Reef 

Mining Corporation (Copper Reef), a private company organized under the laws of 

Manitoba. Copper Reef had funded the initial $1.5 million payment and agreed to issue to 

Foran 5,500,000 common shares of Copper Reef.  Subject to regulatory approval, Foran 

also agreed to subscribe for 2,500,000 units of Copper Reef at a price of $0.20 per unit, 

which gave Foran a 48.41% equity interest in Copper Reef. Copper Reef is a private 

company organized under the laws of the Province of Manitoba.  

 

In a subsequent event, Foran and Copper Reef were in dispute regarding the 

assignment agreement concerning the Property Option Agreement for the McIlvenna Bay 

deposit. This matter was resolved on May 24, 2006 and, under the settlement agreement, 

Foran made the final payment of $2,000,000 for the McIlvenna Bay Project, prior to May 

31, 2006. Foran's $1,500,000 payment to the Hanson Lake Joint Venture on behalf of 

Copper Reef (Foran contributed $500,000 to Copper Reef for that payment on January 

25, 2005) stays in the project. Foran gave Copper Reef a 25% interest in the claims, 

retained 75% for itself, and entered into a joint venture agreement with Copper Reef in 

which Foran is the operator. Foran will retain approximately 25% of shares of Copper 

Reef, and is able to maintain that percentage through participation in future Copper Reef 

fund raising. The original 1% NSR in favour of the original Hanson Lake Joint Venture 

remains the responsibility of the current Foran-Copper Reef joint venture. 

 

In order to carry out a diamond drilling program through the coming winter, Foran 

has applied for and received a Temporary Work Camp Permit, a Surface Exploration 

Permit, and an Aquatic Habitat Protection Permit.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 

The McIlvenna Bay Project is located one kilometre south of Hanson Lake, 

Saskatchewan, and approximately 95 km by road west of Flin Flon, Manitoba (Figure 4-

1).  The deposit is located five kilometres southeast of the Western Nuclear (or Hanson 

Lake) Mine, a former producer located on the western shore of Hanson Lake.  The 

McIlvenna site is accessible via an 18 km long all weather gravel road which connects to 

Saskatchewan Provincial Highway #106. 

 

The mining town of Flin Flon, population 6,000, is the largest commercial/residential 

centre in the area. Flin Flon is a railhead on the Hudson Bay railway. Electrical power 

would be available from Saskatchewan Power Corporation at Creighton, Saskatchewan. 

 

CLIMATE 
The climate in the Hanson Lake area is continental, with cold winters and moderate to 

warm summers. The area is classified as having a subhumid high boreal ecoclimate. The 

mean temperatures for January and July are -21oC and 18oC, respectively. Temperature 

ranges from -40oC in the winter to 30oC in the summer can be expected. Annual 

precipitation averages about 350 mm of rain and 1,450 mm of snow. There are on 

average 119 frost-free days per year. Lake ice thaws in April and returns in November. 

 

LOCAL RESOURCES 
The Flin Flon-Creighton area has a mining history dating back to the 1920s. Road and 

rail access is good. General labour, experienced mining professionals and a variety of 

contractors are available in the area. Local communities are supportive of mining. 

 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 5-2

INFRASTRUCTURE 
The only infrastructure on the property is an Atco-type office unit and a core storage 

yard. 

 

Water for a mining/milling operation could be drawn from one of the local lakes. 

Tailings impoundment areas would have to be constructed locally where there is the 

advantage of the natural alkaline buffering capacity of bedrock dolomite. 

 

PHYSIOGRAPHY  
The property is located within the Boreal Shield Ecozone and is covered with shield-

type boreal forest.  Topography is flat lying with occasional sharp dolomite cliffs and 

ridges up to 20 m high.  Soil thickness on the limestone ridges is minimal, with 

occasional rock exposure, and the vegetation is dominated by larger conifer and poplar 

trees.  Below the cliffs are poorly drained muskeg swamps with scattered tamarack and 

black spruce. Throughout the surrounding area, there are numerous lakes and ponds of 

various sizes. 

 

McIlvenna Bay of Hanson Lake is at an elevation of approximately 318 m. The base 

station on the survey grid over the deposit is at an elevation of 325.13 m.

6 HISTORY 
In 1957, the Parrex Mining Syndicate tested an electromagnetic (EM) conductor 

delineated under a small bay on the western side of Hanson Lake and intersected 

impressive Zn-Pb massive sulphide mineralization which led to the development of the 

Hanson Lake (Western Nuclear) Mine.  The mine operated between 1967 and 1969 and 

produced 162, 200 tons of ore averaging 9.99% Zn, 5.83% Pb, 0.51% Cu, and 4.0 oz/t Ag 

prior to being shut down.  An undisclosed tonnage of unmined resource exists below the 

workings of the mine. 

 
In 1976, the Saskatchewan Mineral Development Corporation (SMDC), the 

provincial government exploration vehicle that eventually became Cameco Corporation, 

acquired a large exploration lease centered on Hanson Lake.  The permit area covered 

much of the exposed portion of the Hanson Lake Block (see Item 7 Geological Setting) 

and extended several kilometres south of the present Hanson Lake Property. In 1977, 

SMDC flew an Aerodat helicopter-borne EM survey across much of the permit area with 

lines oriented east-west. 

 
From 1978 to 1988, Cameco tested selected Aerodat EM anomalies with ground 

follow-up exploration programs consisting of grid establishment, geological mapping (in 

the exposed portions of the belt), and ground geophysical surveys which included 

Horizontal Loop EM (HLEM), Time-Domain EM (TEM), and Surface Pulse EM 

surveys.  Diamond drilling led to the discovery of three new showings, the Miskat Zone 

(Cu), the Grid B occurrence (Zn), and the Zinc Zone (Zn).   

 

In 1985, the Granges-Troymin joint venture discovered the Balsam Zone, a VMS 

deposit located under the Paleozoic cover, approximately 8 km southeast of Hanson 

Lake. This prompted Cameco to re-evaluate their existing airborne EM data between the 

new discovery and Hanson Lake and resulted in a decision to conduct a Mark VI 

helicopter INPUT survey over the area south of Hanson Lake, with flight lines oriented 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 6-2

NE-SW.  The survey delineated a 1,200 m long INPUT anomaly, striking east-southeast, 

one kilometre south of McIlvenna Bay. 

 
In January, 1988, a ground magnetometer and HLEM survey defined the anomaly and 

six holes were subsequently drilled into what is now the McIlvenna Bay deposit. From 

1989 to 1991, an additional 61 drill holes were completed.  Fifty-six of the holes were 

drilled to test the deposit, of which only five failed to intersect economically significant 

mineralization.  In 1991, Cameco suspended exploration activities at the Hanson Lake 

property after a corporate decision was made not to explore for base metals.  The 

property remained idle until optioned in 1998 by Foran. 

 

As of May 31, 2000, Foran drilled 59 additional holes totaling 33,350 m into the 

property, with 57 holes directly testing the deposit.  The first 44 holes were drilled with 

the objective of upgrading the quality of the resource to a depth of 580 m from the 

inferred resource category to the indicated resource category.  This was completed by 

August 31, 1999, and a subsequent mineral resource estimate was prepared by M'Ore 

Exploration Services.  The last 15 holes were drilled below the plunge line and down 

plunge of the deposit and extended the deposit an additional 300 m vertically below the 

plunge of the previous resource base. 

 

Mineral resource evaluations of the McIlvenna Bay deposit have been completed on 

seven separate occasions through the history of the project.  Cameco completed three 

separate internal mineral resource estimates between 1989 and 1993 and another estimate 

in 1990, which was prepared by their Engineering and Project Division as part of a 

feasibility study.  J.H. Reedman & Associates of Winnipeg completed an independent 

evaluation on behalf of Cameco in September 1993.  Upon signing of the option to 

purchase agreement, M.D. Rusk of Geosight Consulting Canada completed an estimate 

on behalf of Foran in May 1998, prior to the commencement of Foran's drill program.  

 

The most recent estimate, with the largest drill database, was completed by R. 

Lemaitre of M'Ore Exploration Services in June 14, 2000, after the completion of 

Foran's 44-hole infill drilling program.  This block model resource estimate was based on

a total of 63,344 m of diamond drilling from 124 holes, of which 33,350 m of drilling 

was completed by Foran between December 1998 and May 2000.  Cut-off grades of 1.5% 

copper or 4.0% zinc were used.  The area between L93+00E and L103+50E and above 

the 580 m vertical depth was deemed to have been drilled at sufficient intersection 

spacings to be classified as an indicated resource.  The remainder of the mineralization 

delineated to a maximum depth of 1,230 m vertical is classified as inferred resources. 

Estimated resources are listed in Table 6-1.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The Hanson Lake property is located on the western edge of the Early Proterozoic 

Flin Flon Greenstone Belt (FFGB) which extends from north central Manitoba into 

northeastern Saskatchewan. The FFGB forms part of the Reindeer Zone, a subdivision of 

the Trans-Hudson Orogen, a continental-scale tectonic event which occurred 

approximately between 1.84Ga and 1.80 Ga (Syme et al., 1999) as a result of the collision 

between  the Superior and Hearne Archean Cratons. 

 

The FFGB is composed of structurally juxtaposed volcanic and sedimentary 

assemblages that were emplaced in a variety of tectonic environments. The major 1.92-

1.88 Ga components include aerially significant juvenile arc and juvenile ocean-floor 

rocks, and minor ocean plateau/ocean island basalt. The juvenile arc assemblage 

comprises tholeiitic, calc-alkaline, and lesser shoshonitic and boninitic rocks similar in 

major and trace element geochemistry to modern intra-oceanic arcs. Ocean-floor basalt 

sequences are exclusively tholeiitic, and are geochemically similar to modern N- and E- 

type MORBs erupted in back-arc basins. Evolved arc assemblages and Archean crustal 

slices are present within the FFGB as minor components. 

 

Collectively, these tectonostratigraphic assemblages were juxtaposed in an 

accretionary complex at ca. 1.88-1.87 Ga, presumably as a result of arc-arc collisions. 

The collage was basement to 1.87-1.83 Ga, post-accretion arc magmatism, expressed as 

voluminous calc-alkaline plutons and rarely preserved calc-alkaline to alkaline volcanic 

rocks. Unroofing of the accretionary collage and deposition of continental alluvial-fluvial 

sedimentary rocks (Missi Group) and marine turbidites (Burntwood Group) occurred ca. 

1.85-1.84 Ga, coeval with the waning stages of post-accretion arc magmatism. The 

sedimentary suites were imbricated with volcanic assemblages in the eastern FFGB 

during 1.85-1.82 Ga juxtaposition of the supracrustal rocks along pre-peak metamorphic 

structures.

SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 7-2

As currently viewed, the FFGB contains eight geographically separate juvenile island 

arc volcanic assemblages (blocks), each being 20 km to 50 km across.  From east to west, 

they are known as the Snow Lake, Four Mile Island, Sheridon, Flin Flon, Birch Lake, 

West Amisk, Hanson Lake, and Northern Lights Assemblages (Zwanzig et al, 1997 and 

Maxeiner et al., 1999).  These assemblages are separated by major structural features 

and/or areas of differing tectonostratigraphic origin.  It is unclear whether the eight 

juvenile arc sequences represent different island arcs, or segments of a larger continuous 

arc (Syme et al., 1999). Within the belt, each tectonostratigraphic block has been broken 

into several sub-blocks, usually bounded by local to regional fault systems.  Correlation 

of stratigraphy between sub-blocks is difficult to impossible to determine. 

 

The exposed portion of the FFGB is approximately 250 km in an EW direction by 75 

km NS. Although it has an apparent easterly trend, this is an artefact of the belt's tectonic 

contact with gneissic metasedimentary, metavolcanic, and plutonic rocks to the north 

(Kisseynew Domain) and the east-trending trace of Phanerozoic platformal cover rocks to 

the south. In reality, the FFGB extends hundreds of kilometres to the south-southwest 

beneath a thin cover of essentially flat-lying, Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks.  

 

By Early Ordovician time the area of northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba had been 

effectively peneplaned and a regolith was developed on exposed rocks. Inundation by the 

Ordovician ocean initiated the deposition of the Phanerozoic cover sequence which, in 

the McIlvenna Bay area, is now represented by the basal Winnipeg Formation sandstone 

overlain by the Red River Formation dolomite. 

 

In the general Flin Flon area, the predominant direction for the Late Wisconsinan ice-

flow indicators is south-southwest indicating that the ice was flowing from a Keewatin 

dispersal centre. The resulting tills are thin and generally reflect local bedrock lithologies 

(McMartin et al, 1999).

LOCAL GEOLOGY 

The Hanson Lake Block, the host terrain of the McIlvenna Bay deposit, is bound to 

the east by the Sturgeon-Weir Shear Zone and to the west by the Tabbernor Fault Zone.  

The block extends an unknown distance to the south beneath a nearly flat lying cover of 

Ordovician sandstones of the Winnipeg Formation, and dolomites of the Red River 

Formation. To the north, the block is bound by the Kisseynew Domain, a gneissic 

metasedimentary belt and the Attitti Complex.  The east end of the block hosts the 

Hanson Lake Pluton, a large compositionally variable granodiorite to pyroxenite 

intrusion.   

 

In the Hanson Lake area, north of the Paleozoic margin, the exposed Proterozoic 

rocks of the Hanson Lake Block are dominated by juvenile island arc, felsic to 

intermediate metavolcanic rocks, with subordinate amounts of mafic volcanics, minor 

intermediate volcanics, and greywackes.  Oxide facies iron formations are not commonly 

exposed but their presence has been confirmed by diamond drilling.  Long continuous 

magnetic trends suggest that the distribution of iron formations is very wide spread in the 

area south of Hanson Lake.  The sequence has been intruded by various felsic intrusions, 

some of which are believed to be subvolcanic intrusions.  Abundant diorite and gabbro 

plugs and dykes cut the sequence, as well as minor ultramafic intrusions (Koziol et al., 

1991).  The supracrustal rocks generally dip moderately to steeply east to northeast.  

South of Hanson Lake, the Proterozoic sequence is poorly understood because of the 

unconformably overlying Paleozoic sedimentary rocks.  The McIlvenna Bay deposit 

projects to subsurface under the sedimentary cover (Lemaitre, 2000). 

 

At least two distinct folding events, both having northerly trending fold axes, have 

influenced the stratigraphy in the Hanson Lake Area.  Peak regional metamorphism in the 

areas west and north of Hanson Lake reached upper amphibolite facies as observed by the 

partial melting of the granodiorite-tonalite assemblage in the Jackpine and Tulabi Lake 

areas. At the McIlvenna Bay deposit, the Proterozoic sequence exhibits a greenschist 

metamorphic facies as the deposit alteration assemblages are dominated by sericite and 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 7-5

chlorite. The greenschist facies is probably a retrograde event after a previous 

amphibolite grade since relict cordierite, anthophyllite, garnet and andalusite are 

commonly observed in the VMS alteration package (Lemaitre, 2000). U-Pb ages of 

supracrustal rocks in the block constrain the metamorphic event between 1808 and 1804 

Ma (Maxeiner et al., 1999). U-Pb age dating of a quartz-feldspar porphyry (a possible 

subvolcanic intrusion) which intruded the supracrustal sequence yielded a date of 1888 ± 

12 Ma.   

 

PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

Lacking any outcrop in the area of the deposit, the property geology has been 

interpreted from the drill core record with help from geophysical surveys. The discussion 

below is extracted from Lemaitre (2000). 

 

The stratigraphy of the deposit area, divided into six formations (Figure 7-2), has 

been defined over a two kilometre strike length by a total of 124 drill holes. The lowest 

formation intersected by drilling both structurally and stratigraphically is the McIlvenna 

Bay Formation (Figure 7-3), the host of the McIlvenna Bay deposit.  The McIlvenna 

Bay Formation is overlain to the north by the Cap Tuffite Formation.  The McIlvenna 

Bay Formation and the Cap Tuffite Formation may be genetically related but have been 

separated as they are temporally distinct, as demonstrated by the positioning of the 

McIlvenna Bay massive sulphide deposit between these two units, an obvious exhalative 

horizon (and hence a period of clastic and volcano-sedimentary quiescence).  Overlying 

the Cap Tuffite Formation is the Koziol Iron Formation, a long and distinctive marker 

formation traceable for several kilometres along strike by mapping and geophysics.  

Topping the Koziol Iron Formation is the Rusk Formation, a thick package of mafic 

volcanics.  The Rusk Formation in turn is overlain by the thin HW-A Formation, an 

exhalative massive sulphide horizon which grades laterally into iron formation.  Capping 

the HW-A Formation is a thick unsorted bimodal package of mafic and felsic volcanics 

and mafic intrusions and minor iron formations tentatively called the Upper Sequence 

which may be thickened due to folding and faulting.  The stratigraphic package has been 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 7-6

cut by several different intrusions, the largest of which is the Davies Gabbro, a sill-like 

plug found within the Cap Tuffite Formation.  The basement geology is unconformably 

overlain by the relatively flat lying to shallowly south-dipping Ordovician dolomites and 

sandstones of the Red River and Winnipeg Formations which have an average total 

thickness between 20 m and 30 m. 

 

The McIlvenna Bay Formation, the host formation of the sulphide deposit, is known 

only to the extent it has been drilled below the footwall of the deposit. The formation is at 

least 200 m thick (true thickness) and is comprised of massive and semi-massive 

sulphides, variably altered felsic volcanics, volcaniclastics and/or volcanic-derived 

sediments of rhyolitic composition. 

 

Overlying the mineralized horizons of the McIlvenna Bay Formation is the Cap 

Tuffite Formation, a sequence of intercalated felsic volcanic and cherty metasediments 

which have been intruded by sills and dykes of the Davies Gabbro (described below).  

The unit ranges from 35 m to 55 m thick, is finely banded to finely laminated, and ranges 

from white to cream to grey-green in colour.  Sections of the formation range from very 

finely laminated, bleached chert to 1 cm to 10 cm thick banded, fine-grained, aphantic 

rhyolitic tuff.  Discrete contacts between the units are nebulous.  Instead, wide transitions 

are observed from one end member to the other.  It is believed that the formation 

represents a sequence of redeposited, water-lain, distal volcaniclastics and chert. An east 

to west zonation is observed in the Cap Tuffite from cherty-dominated in the east to 

rhyolitic-dominated in the west. 

 

Stratigraphically overlying the Cap Tuffite is the Koziol Iron Formation, a long, 

continuous exhalative horizon traceable in drill core and by geophysics over several 

kilometres and, as such, an excellent stratigraphic marker horizon.  The unit is a true 

oxide-facies iron formation that ranges from 0.1 m to 25 m true thickness and is 

composed of 1 cm to 5 cm thick bands of fine-grained chert, interbedded with 1 mm to 50 

mm massive magnetite bands and 1 cm to 1 m thick massive grunerite±garnet±magnetite 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 7-7

±chlorite  bands.  Occasional pyrite and/or pyrrhotite are observed in selected bands. 

Near the base of the iron formation is a one metre thick bed of graphitic chert. 

 

Overlying the Koziol Formation is the Rusk Formation, a thick package of massive 

and calcite-altered mafic volcanic rocks that are approximately 100 m thick.  The mafic 

rocks are likely massive flows, although the thickness of individual flow units cannot be 

determined from drill core.  No distinct flow tops or pillow structures have been 

observed.  However, patchy 1 mm to 2 mm diameter white to pink rounded feldspar 

amygdules have been noted locally. 

 

Topping the Rusk Formation is another exhalative horizon, the HW-A Formation 

which ranges from 1 cm to 5 m thick and shows a transition from west to east from 

oxide-facies iron formation to massive sphalerite. From the centre of the McIlvenna 

deposit and to the west, the HW-A Formation is an oxide-facies iron formation identical 

to that of the Koziol Formation.  Overlying the iron formation is a 1 m to 10 m thick 

massive mafic volcanic unit. From the centre of the deposit and to the east, the unit is 

comprised of either a thin pyrite band or massive sphalerite-pyrite from 10 cm to 75 cm 

thick.  Overlying this portion of the unit is a thin 5 m to15 m thick massive, grey, felsic 

volcanic unit.   

 

Overlying the HW-A Formation is +400 m thick Upper Sequence, a bimodal 

package of volcanic units that have been difficult to correlate from hole to hole.  

Approximately 45% of the unit is composed of aphanitic, grey, felsic volcanic, and 50% 

fine-grained mafic volcanic rocks.  Some of the mafic units may be gabbroic intrusions.  

Approximately 5% of the unit is composed of greywackes and at least two additional 

oxide-facies iron formation horizons.  Individual members of the formation are difficult 

to trace between drill holes as the existing drill holes that are collared far enough to the 

north to intersect the Upper Sequence are sparse and generally widely spaced.  The Upper 

Sequence is not yet defined to the extent that it could be broken down into formational 

units. The down plunge drilling program has discovered that the Upper Sequence may be 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 7-8

the core of a regional synclinal structure and that the bimodal sequence may be 

structurally repeated by both folding and faulting (Lemaitre, 2000). 

 

The Davies Gabbro, a plug up to 100 m thick east of the deposit extends westward 

toward the centre of the sulphide body where it narrows into a series of thin dykes.  The 

gabbro appears to be a series of sills that have intruded along the bedding planes of the 

Cap Tuffite Formation.  The gabbro plug plunges along an axis parallel to the sulphide 

body and appears to exert some sort of control over the limits of mineralization along the 

bottom plunge line of the deposit. The unit ranges from fine-grained to very coarse 

grained; the grain size appears to be directly related to the unit thickness.  Chilled 

margins have been observed on the thicker dykes.  It appears that the gabbro intruded 

along the bedding planes of the wet, cherty banded sediments of the Cap Tuffite.  

 

STRUCTURE 
Stratigraphy in the deposit area strikes between 275o and 295o and dips to the north at 

65o-70o, although in selected areas it dips vertically.  The deposit has the same orientation 

as the stratigraphy and also plunges at approximately 45o to the northwest.  Rocks in the 

host stratigraphy are massive to strongly foliated, the intensity of which depends on the 

competency of each individual unit and the degree of alteration. 

 

Two phases of folding of the host stratigraphy have been observed in the drill core 

and are believed to correspond to the regional F2 and F3 folding events.  The first phase 

(regional F2) was responsible for the development of the dominant observed structural 

fabric, a foliation oriented at approximately 280o/65o (parallel to stratigraphy).  The 

foliation is well developed in the least competent stratigraphic units, particularly the 

footwall altered rocks.  Isoclinal folding of the iron formation, observed in several drill 

holes, has a plunge that is estimated to be approximately 45o to the west or west-north-

west, which is roughly parallel to the plunge of the deposit.  A strong crenulation 

(regional F3 event) of the foliation is developed in portions of the footwall alteration 

zone.  The plunge of the crenulation is much flatter, usually less than 25o, and trends 

either northwest or northeast.  This trend and plunge of the crenulation appears to be

SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com

parallel to the fold axis of gentle to open folds observed in banded felsic volcano-

sedimentary units both above and below the deposit and may be responsible for the broad 

warping of the stratigraphy observed in the magnetic maps between the Hanson Lake and 

the south end of McIlvenna Bay (Lemaitre, 2000). 

 

Evidence of faulting has been documented in drill core.  However, it is difficult to 

determine the orientation, scale, or continuity of most faults between drill holes with the 

present level of information.  The deep drilling program outlined a large fault structure 

that strikes east-northeast and dips steeply to the north.  This fault appears to truncate the 

northern limb of the regional F2 synclinal structure discussed above.  The fault is well to 

the north of the deposit and likely would not impact on the mineralized horizon above the 

1,800 m vertical depth (Lemaitre, 2000).

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The target deposit on the McIlvenna Bay property is a volcanogenic massive sulphide 

(VMS) deposit, a synvolcanic accumulation of sulphide minerals that occur in geological 

environments characterized by submarine volcanic rocks.  In Canada, these deposits are 

commonly found in Precambrian through Mesozoic volcano-sedimentary greenstone 

belts in an extensional arc environment such as a rift or caldera.    The associated 

volcanic rocks are commonly relatively primitive (tholeiitic to transitional), bimodal and 

submarine in origin (Galley et al., 2005).  The spatial relationship of VMS deposits to 

synvolcanic faults, rhyolite domes or paleotopographic depressions, caldera rims or 

subvolcanic intrusions suggests that the deposits were closely related to particular and 

coincident hydrologic, topographic, and geothermal features on the ocean floor (Lydon, 

1990). 

 

VMS deposits are exhalative deposits, formed through the focused discharge of hot, 

metal-rich hydrothermal fluids.  These deposits commonly occur in clusters which form a 

VMS camp.  In many cases, it can be demonstrated that the sub-seafloor fluid convection 

system was apparently driven by large, 15 km to 25 km long, mafic to composite, high 

level subvolcanic intrusions.  The distribution of synvolcanic faults relative to the 

underlying intrusion determines the size and areal morphology of the camp alteration 

system and ultimately the size and distribution of the VMS deposit cluster.  These fault 

systems, which act as conduits for volcanic feeder systems and hydrothermal fluids, may 

remain active through several cycles of volcanic and hydrothermal activity.  This can 

result in several periods of VMS formation at different stratigraphic levels (Galley et al., 

2005). 

 

The idealized, undeformed and unmetamorphosed Archean VMS deposit, as 

exemplified by the Matagami deposits, typically consists of a concordant lens of massive 

sulphides, composed of 60% or more sulphide minerals (pyrite-pyrrhotite-sphalerite-

chalcopyrite with associated magnetite), that is stratigraphically underlain by a discordant 

stockwork or stringer zone of vein-type sulphide mineralization (pyrite-pyrrhotite-



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 8-2

chalcopyrite and magnetite) contained in a pipe of hydrothermally altered rock (Sangster 

and Scott, 1976).  The upper contact of the massive sulphide lens with hanging wall rocks 

is usually extremely sharp, while the lower contact is gradational into the stringer zone.  

A single deposit or mine may consist of several individual massive sulphide lenses and 

their underlying stockwork zones.  It is thought that the stockwork zone represents the 

near-surface channel ways of a submarine hydrothermal system and the massive sulphide 

lens represents the accumulation of sulphides precipitated from the hydrothermal 

solutions, on the sea floor, above and around the discharge vent (Lydon, 1990).  VMS 

deposits are commonly divided into Cu-Zn, Zn-Cu, and Zn-Pb-Cu groups according to 

their contained ratios of these three metals (Galley et al., 2005). 

 

Most Canadian VMS deposits are characterized by discordant stockwork vein 

systems or pipes that, unless transposed by structure, commonly underlie the massive 

sulphide lenses, but may also be present in the immediate hanging wall strata.  These 

pipes, comprised of inner chloritized cores surrounded by an outer zone of sericitization, 

occur at the centre of more extensive, discordant alteration zones.  The alteration zones 

and pipe systems often host stringer chalcopyrite-pyrite/pyrrhotite±Au and may extend 

vertically below a deposit for several hundred metres or may continue above the deposit 

for tens to hundreds of metres as a discordant alteration zone (Ansil and Noranda 

deposits).  In some cases, the proximal alteration zone and attendant stockwork/pipe vein 

mineralization connects a series of stacked massive sulphide lenses (Amulet, Noranda, 

LaRonde, and Bousquet deposits), representing synchronous and/or sequential phases of 

ore formation during successive breaks in volcanic activity (Galley et al., 2005). 

 

The McIlvenna Bay deposit consists of structurally modified, strataform, 

volcanogenic, polymetallic massive sulphide mineralization and associated stringer zone 

mineralization.  The sulphides contain copper and zinc, with low lead and silver and gold 

values.   

 

The McIlvenna Bay sulphide deposit (Figure 7-3) has undergone strong deformation 

and upper greenschist to amphibolite facies metamorphism.  The massive sulphide lenses 



  www.rpacan.com

are now attenuated down the plunge to the northwest.  Typical aspect ratios of length 

down-plunge to width exceed 10:1. The extent of remobilization of sulphides within the 

deposit is uncertain.

9 MINERALIZATION 
The McIlvenna Bay deposit is comprised of five different zones and includes three 

distinct styles of mineralization.  The five different zones identified are the Lens 2, the 

Upper West, Lens 3, Lens 4 and the Copper Stringer Zones.  The three different styles of 

mineralization are massive sulphides, semi-massive sulphides, and copper stringers.  

Each style is mineralogically and texturally distinct. 

 

The Lens 2 Massive Sulphide (Figure 7-3) is by far the largest and most significant 

massive sulphide zone in the McIlvenna Bay deposit.  It has a strike length of 400 m to 

550 m, ranges in true thickness from 0.40 m to 16.75 m and has an average thickness of 

5.55 m.  The zone plunges approximately 45o to the north and strikes at 295o with an 

average dip of 68o.  The zone has been defined from the top of the Proterozoic sequence 

at a vertical depth of 35 m down to a depth of 1,230 m and remains open down plunge. 

The zone appears to be continuous both along strike and down dip. The assemblage 

pyrite-sphalerite suggests that this zone could have been deposited off the flank of a 

hydrothermal vent.  

 

The Upper West Zone is a relatively copper-gold-enriched semi-massive sulphide 

unit found as a long strip that lies parallel to and along the top of the plunge line of the 

Lens 2 Massive Sulphide. It is believed to be on the same stratigraphic horizon as, and 

laterally continuous with, the Lens 2 Massive Sulphide, with a 25 m to 50 m wide 

transition zone between the two. The Upper West Zone has a strike length of 150 m to 

300 m and has been delineated between the vertical depths of 35 m and 1,230 m. It varies 

from 2.80 m to 10.60 m true thickness and averages 4.81 m true thickness. The zone 

remains open down plunge below the 1,230 m level. This zone also appears to be one 

continuous sheet and is relatively more copper and gold-rich compared to the Lens 2 

Massive Sulphide.   

 

The Lens 3 Massive Sulphide is a discontinuous and generally very thin massive and 

semi-massive sulphide horizon that is located 10 m to 30 m above the Lens 2 and Upper 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 9-2

West horizon.  The zone has a strike length of 100 m to 350 m and plunges parallel to the 

underlying mineralized zones. The true thickness of the zone ranges from 0.18 m to 6.65 

m and averages 2.39 m. The zone is dominated by massive sulphides although semi-

massive sulphides and typical copper stringer mineralization have been observed in 

certain holes.  The zone is occasionally underlain by weak copper stringer mineralization. 

The majority of the zone is comprised of sub-economic grade massive sulphides over 

widths of less than 3.0 m.  Pods within the zone obtain threshold economic grades that 

exceed the minimum mining width, the largest of which has a strike length of 250 m and 

a dip extent of 50 m.     

 

The Foran infill drilling program discovered the Lens 4 mineralized zone located 

approximately 40 m to 50 m below the Upper West Zone of the Lens 2 horizon, roughly 

between coordinates 9300E and 9500E.  The zone was intersected in four holes, HA-26, 

MB-99-107, MB-99-108, and MB-99-118.  In hole 107, a large semi-massive interval 

was intersected with mineralogy, texture, and grades similar to that of the Upper West 

Zone.  The zone was underlain by a thick copper stringer zone.  Copper stringer style 

mineralization was also intersected in HA-26, MB-99-108, and MB-99-118.  Extension 

of existing holes below and east of hole 107 failed to intersect the Lens 4 Mineralized 

Zone.  The extent of the mineralization associated with this zone is not fully understood 

but it remains open down plunge to the northwest. 

 

The Copper Stringer Zone underlies and is in contact with the Upper West Zone and 

the western half of the Lens 2 Massive Sulphide.  The zone is wedge-shaped with the 

blunt edge running parallel to the plunge of, and underlying the Upper West Zone.  The 

wedge terminates near the central axis of the Lens 2 Massive Sulphide. The zone is 

thickest underlying the Upper West Zone, where it is considered to be the proximal 

hydrothermal feeder zone for the hydrothermal system which deposited the massive 

sulphides.  Stringer mineralization in this area is hosted in chlorite-altered rock.  To the 

east, immediately underlying the Lens 2 Massive Sulphides, the stringer mineralization is 

hosted in fine fracture networks in silicified and sericitized rock. The zone has been 

delineated between the vertical depths of 35 m and 1,230 m.  The best mineralized

portion (>1.5% Cu) lies within a much larger envelope of sub-economic grade copper 

stringer mineralization.  The portion exceeding minimum grade requirements is fairly 

continuous, with minor gaps or holes.  This portion has a strike length of 300 m to 600 m 

and ranges from 0.57 m to 48.30 m true thickness, averaging 8.08 m.  The stringer zone 

remains open to the west and down plunge below the 930 m level. 

 

Massive sulphides are typical of Lens 2 and Lens 3 horizons.  This style of 

mineralization is composed of 70% to 80% medium-sized and subrounded pyrite grains 

resembling 'buckshot'.  Sphalerite is hosted as fine-grained and sometimes feathery 

minerals located in the interstices of the pyrite grains ranging from 5% to 25% of the total 

unit.  The sphalerite is generally dark to medium-brown in colour. Faint banding of the 

massive sulphides is occasionally apparent.  Up to 10% fine-grained grey quartz, and 

occasionally fine calcite, are also observed in the interstices. Subangular to subrounded 

inclusions or fragments of massive black chlorite ranging from 2 mm to 50 mm in 

diameter comprise 10% of the unit.  Patchy but common rounded chert fragments ranging 

from 1 cm to 3 cm in diameter can constitute up to 20% of the unit locally.  Such chert, 

when present, is often surrounded by 1 cm to 3 cm thick zones of enhanced, pale brown 

sphalerite.  

 

The semi-massive sulphides are typical of the Upper West Zone and Lens 4, and 

selected parts of Lens 3.  The semi-massive sulphides range from 20% to 60% sulphides 

which are found as veinlets, veins, and pods within strongly chlorite-altered rock.  The 

sulphide portion tends to be either sphalerite or chalcopyrite-dominant, with less than 

20% fine-grained pyrite.  Sphalerite-dominant portions are generally comprised of 

reddish or pale brown to blonde sphalerite indicative of zinc-rich and iron-poor 

sphalerite.  Individual veins or pods have been documented to contain up to 56% zinc.  

Less common are the chalcopyrite-dominant intervals which are composed of 80% 

chalcopyrite over narrow widths. Veining and replacement textures are common in the 

semi-massive sulphides.

The copper stringer mineralization is generally confined to the area below the Upper 

West and Lens 2, but has been observed as part of the Lens 4 Zone and sometimes is 

found underlying the Lens 3 Zone.  The nature of the stringer zone mineralization varies 

according to the host altered rock.  Chlorite alteration-hosted copper stringer 

mineralization is comprised of chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite, with occasional pyrite, and is 

found in veinlets and pods cutting the chlorite alteration.  Sericite-quartz altered copper 

stringer zones tend to be comprised exclusively of chalcopyrite which lines fine, hairline 

fractures within the strongly silicified host, and as 5 cm to 10 cm long semi-massive pods 

containing angular to rounded host rock fragments.  These pods and fractures appear to 

be late brittle features and suggest that the chalcopyrite was remobilized into fractured 

rock possibly during deformational events.  This latter style of copper stringer 

mineralization typically lies as a subordinate unit beneath the Lens 2 Massive Sulphides. 

 

The sulphide mineralogy and the size of the alteration package suggest the presence 

of a proximal vent environment along the entire top plunge line of the McIlvenna Bay 

deposit which is represented by the Upper West Zone.  The location of the Lens 3 and 

Lens 4 zones respectively overlying and underlying the Upper West Zone is not a 

coincidence and may represent additional smaller hydrothermal pulses at different 

stratigraphic timelines.   

 

An interesting feature of the deposit is the fact that the Upper West Zone remains 

open down plunge and, likely, both the zone and the plumbing system underlying it will 

continue at depth.  This possibility should be tested by additional drilling.

11 DRILLING 
Cameco and Foran employed similar drilling procedures on the McIlvenna Bay 

Project. The top of the holes from surface down through the Paleozoic cover sequence 

was drilled with HQ rods.  The drill string was reduced to NQ for drilling below the 

Proterozoic regolith.  This same procedure was employed by Cameco during their drilling 

program.  All but a handful of the Cameco holes, and all of the Foran holes still have 

their HQ rod string in the hole allowing one to locate the holes on surface and to re-enter 

them if necessary. 

 

Down hole surveying of Cameco holes HA-60 through HA-65 was completed using 

acid tests only.  Holes HA-01 through HA-17, and HA-66 and HA-67 were completed 

using Tropari and acid test measurements.  All other Cameco holes were surveyed using 

the Techdel International Light-Log system. 

 
Down hole surveying on all of the Foran holes was done using a combination of 

Tropari measurements and acid tests.  Due to the presence of magnetic rocks in the 

stratigraphy, especially the iron formations, Tropari azimuths were sometimes inaccurate 

and were occasionally ignored in order to get reasonably accurate hole locations.  Tropari 

measurements were taken at approximately 75 m intervals, and acid tests were taken 

every 50 m. The use of Tropari measurements was considered acceptable for the shorter 

holes as the influence of the one or two iron formation horizons intersected in such holes 

could be eliminated by careful analysis of the tropari data, logging of the core, and 

magnetic susceptibility measurements of the core from area around the survey location.  

However, the Tropari instrument was totally inadequate as a surveying tool for the deep, 

step out holes 67, 111, 120A, 122, 122W1, 124, and 125.  Stratigraphy in this area 

appears to be isoclinally folded with the nose area in the vicinity of the collars of 122, 

124, and 125. 

 

Foran concluded that the locations of the intersections of holes 67, 111, 120A, 122, 

122W1, 124, and 125 have an estimated error of ±50 m in the east-west direction and ±25 

m in the vertical direction (Lemaitre, 2000). Thus the location of each hole will have a

SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 11-2

direct impact on a resource estimate. A resurvey of many, or all, of the holes with a non-

magnetic down hole instrument may be warranted in the future.

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
For all Foran drill holes, assay samples were generally taken on 1.0 m intervals and 

all sample boundaries respected the geological contacts.  Samples smaller than 1.0 m long 

were taken when necessary to respect such conditions.  Samples as large as 1.5 m long 

were taken in weakly mineralized copper stringer zone estimated to contain less than 1% 

copper. 

 

All samples were cut by diamond saw and one half of the core was submitted for 

assay analysis.  Metal tags with the sample numbers inscribed were stapled into the box 

marking the sample boundaries.  Boundary limits were also marked on the core box itself 

to limit any sampling errors.  The unsampled half of the core was kept intact in the core 

box and stored. 

 

Samples for whole rock geochemistry and ICAP analysis were taken from every 

major unit in every Foran drill hole and relogged Cameco hole.  A short (<30 cm long) 

sample of the entire core was removed from the box and sent for analysis.  A wooden 

marker with the sample number written on it was placed in the box where the sample was 

taken to mark the sample location. 

 

Assays taken during the Cameco program were also taken on 1.0 m intervals.  

However, sample boundaries did not respect the Cameco-logged geological contacts in 

several holes and thus individual samples often crossed the hanging wall-mineralized 

zone contacts or the massive/semi-massive sulphide-stringer zone contacts.  This 

discrepancy could not be resolved during the relogging program because all but two of 

the massive and semi-massive sulphide intersections of these holes were removed by 

Cameco from the racks and used as feed for two metallurgical tests. 

 

Statistics on percentage core recovery are not available for either the Foran or 

Cameco drilling campaigns. From Scott Wilson RPA's examination of core stored in the 

field and in the Saskatoon storage facility we would estimate that there was perhaps 95% 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 12-2

to 98% core recovery, at least in the mineralized sections. Hence the sawed/sampled 

material sent for assay should be an accurate reflection of one half of the core and should 

be free of any bias because of the competent nature of the core produced. 

 

The true thickness of any mineralized intercept can only be estimated on those 

sections where the density of drilling is sufficient to determine the boundaries of the 

mineralized zone(s).

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 

This section describes, to the best of our knowledge, the historical procedures 

employed initially by Cameco and later by Foran. 

 

CAMECO (1988-1991) 

Little information is available for security measures employed, quality control or 

quality assurance procedures and who actually prepared the samples. The samples of 

sawn core were initially sent to TSL Assayers in Saskatoon (TSL). Each sample was 

crushed to a minimum of 60% passing -10 mesh and was split, with the rejects being 

stored at TSL's lab.  A split portion, approximately 250 grams, was pulverized to 90% 

passing –150 mesh.  The split halves were assayed by standard Atomic Absorption 

techniques for zinc, copper, silver, and lead and by fire assay/atomic absorption finish for 

gold.  When the initial assay samples exceeded 1% zinc, 1% copper, or 1 g/t gold, the 

sample was re-analyzed.  Samples from HA-01 to HA-06 were assayed at TSL.  The 

remainder of the samples from HA-07 through HA-67 were assayed at Eco-Tech 

Laboratories in Creighton, Saskatchewan (Eco-Tech).  A total of 152 check assays were 

performed at TSL, Bondar-Clegg (Ottawa), and Terramin Laboratories (Calgary).  

Cameco was pleased with the Eco-Tech results and believed that TSL returned somewhat 

lower values for zinc and, to a lesser extent, copper during check assays (MRDI, 1998). 

 

FORAN MINING CORPORATION (1998-2000) 

The bulk of the assaying from the Foran drilling programs was done at TSL.  Once 

sawn, individual samples were packaged in individual plastic sample bags, which were 

sealed with packing tape, boxed, and taken directly by a Foran representative from the 

field to Creighton, Saskatchewan.  The boxes were shipped via bus to Saskatoon where a 

representative from TSL collected the boxes and brought them to the lab. 

 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 13-2

At TSL, each sample was crushed to a minimum of 60% passing –10 mesh and then 

split, with the rejects being stored at TSL.  A split portion, approximately 250 grams, was 

pulverized to 90% passing –150 mesh. All samples were analyzed for copper, zinc, lead, 

gold, and silver, while samples from holes MB-99-78 through 125 were also analyzed for 

iron and sulphur.  All samples were also analyzed by a 31-element ICAP scan that was 

completed at the TSL laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia. Copper, lead, zinc and 

silver analyses were done by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry, while the gold was 

determined by standard Fire Assay procedures. 

 

One in ten samples assayed by TSL was shipped to the Saskatchewan Research 

Council's Geoanalytical Services Laboratory in Saskatoon (SRC) for check assaying.  In 

the case of a discrepancy between the original and check assay results, the sample was 

rechecked by XRAL Laboratories in Toronto to determine the most accurate result.  In 

their signed assay reports, TSL included the analytical results of all internal repeat 

samples (duplicates) and TSL in-house or Certified Reference Material standard samples 

inserted into the assaying sequence.  Foran's experience was that for most elements, TSL 

assayed very slightly lower (<10% difference) than the corresponding assay done at the 

SRC.  Generally, zinc, lead and silver assays were less than 10% lower at TSL than at 

SRC, copper assays were less than 5% lower, and gold results were comparable 

(Lemaitre, 2000). 

 

During the time periods noted, it is not known what the certifications were for the 

various laboratories mentioned. The analytical procedures employed by TSL are listed in 

Appendix 1. 

 

The QA/QC procedures used by Foran were not as rigorous as one might expect in a 

current program. Nonetheless, Scott Wilson RPA believes that the work was done in 

accordance with the best practices of the time and that the results should be reliable.

SPECIFIC GRAVITY DETERMINATIONS 

From hole MB-99-87 to MB-99-125, Foran had specific gravity determinations of 

each sample done by TSL using the weight in water – weight in air method on the intact 

core sample.  Holes MB-99-78 to MB-99-86 did not have any specific gravity 

determinations but did have iron and sulphur analytical data.  Holes prior to MB-99-78 do 

not have any specific gravity determinations or any sulphur analytical data.

14 DATA VERIFICATION 
On September 28, 2006, R. Barry Cook selected and marked out ten samples of sawn 

core for duplicate analysis.  The specified intervals were quarter split by a technician 

under supervision by Mr. Cook, who then bagged, tagged, and sealed the samples in 

plastic bags. The bags of samples were packed in a box and shipped by courier to the 

Scott Wilson RPA offices in Toronto.  From there they were forwarded by courier to the 

SGS laboratory in Don Mills, Ontario.  Table 14-1 indicates the relevant sample 

information and assay results. 

 

Considering the nature of sulphide material sampled, the duplicate analyses 

correspond reasonably well to the original Foran analyses. The only glaring discrepancy 

is highlighted in the table indicating the Scott Wilson RPA value of 2.49% for the Foran 

sample number 0805 compared to the original value of 0.39%. Scott Wilson RPA has no 

explanation for this difference except for possible inhomogeneity in the core sample. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA also compared analyses as quoted on original assay certificates to 

the numbers listed in drill logs for specific assay intervals. The assays for Cu, Zn, Pb, Au 

and Ag for 162 samples from six different drill holes were checked without locating any 

serious errors in transcription. The few discrepancies noted were in fact only differences 

in the second decimal place.

16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Cameco conducted a feasibility study on the McIlvenna Bay sulphide deposit in 1990. 

As part of the process, they sent 339 kg of sulphide mineralization to Cominco 

Engineering Services Ltd. (CESL) at Trail, British Columbia, for metallurgical testing. 

The mineralization was the remaining half of the split core from their sulphide 

intersections. As such, the material tested should have been representative of the 

McIlvenna Bay deposit as it was known at the time. The sulphides were described as 

being from the A, B, and C Zones, which, in the current Foran terminology, Scott Wilson 

RPA interpret as being the Lens 2, Upper West, and Copper Stringer zones, respectively. 

 

A summary of the CESL metallurgical test work is quoted below. A more complete 

description is found in Appendix 2. 

 

SUMMARY 
The Hanson Lake 'A' zone sample contains approximately 12% sphalerite in 65% 

pyrite with a mesh of liberation of about 50 microns (270 mesh). There is also present up 

to 1% chalcopyrite, which must be separated in order to produce a readily saleable zinc 

concentrate. 

 

A zinc concentrate grading approximately 54% Zn at a recovery of around 90% can 

be produced from the 'A' zone by careful, slow flotation. Three stages of zinc cleaning are 

required. The zinc concentrate is favourably low in magnesia, silica and minor element 

impurities, with the exception of mercury at 200 ppm. 

 

One flotation test was run using Hanson Lake water. There was no significant 

difference between this test and a similar test run using normal Trail water. 

 

The copper impurity cleans up readily to produce a saleable grade copper concentrate 

carrying significant gold and silver values.

SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 16-2

 
The tailings may be treated by single stage cycloning to produce a sand product 

potentially suitable for mine backfilling. The weight recovery to the sand product is 

approximately 75%. 

 

The tailings product remained stable over a four week testing period. It maintains a 

pH of 7.3 to 7.4 with favourably low copper, zinc and iron in solution. 

 

Preliminary testing of material from the high-copper 'C' section of the deposit shows 

that a high grade copper concentrate may be produced at good recovery. 

 

Preliminary testing of material from the mixed copper-zinc 'B' zone of the deposit 

shows significant cross-contamination between copper and zinc. It is concluded that a 

significant metallurgical testing program will be required to develop an optimum 

metallurgy for this material.

17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL 
RESERVE ESTIMATES 
SUMMARY 

Scott Wilson RPA has prepared a mineral resource estimate of the McIlvenna Bay 

deposit using digital drill hole data provided by Foran.  Scott Wilson RPA interpreted a 

set of cross sections, and also used long sections and plans to construct 3D wireframes of 

the mineralized zones. Variogram parameters were determined separately for each 

mineralized zone.  A block model was interpolated using the kriging and inverse distance 

methods and a mineral resource for copper, zinc, and silver was estimated (Table 17-1).   

 

Using long term metal prices, the in-situ Cu and Zn percent values in each block of 

the block model were converted to US$ amounts.  These cash values for Cu and Zn were 

then converted to a NSR (Net Smelter Return) using ratios of in-situ values to NSR 

values for each metal.  The ratios were calculated using the parameters listed, with the Zn 

ratio equal to 0.45 and the copper ratio equalling 0.55.  Silver and gold do not contribute 

any significant value to the NSR and were not included in the calculations. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA classified the mineral resources at McIlvenna Bay in the block 

model into indicated and inferred categories based on drill hole spacing and apparent 

geological and grade continuity of the mineralized zones.  Indicated mineral resources are 

located between L93+00E and L104+00E above the 2,750 m elevation.  Drill hole 

spacing in this area varies from 40 m to 80 m, on 50 m sections.  Inferred mineral 

resources exist below and to the west of the indicated resources along the plunge of the 

deposit.  Drilling in this area is much more irregularly spaced both on and between 

sections. 

 

There are no mineral reserves estimated at McIlvenna Bay at this time.

RESOURCE DATABASE AND VALIDATION 

Scott Wilson RPA received header, survey, assay, lithology and composite data from 

Foran in an older Gemcom (Gemcom GDE v4.x) database.  The database comprised 126 

collar records and 1,658 survey records with 62,698 m of drilling for an average drill hole 

length of 498 m.  The latest drill hole included in the database is MB 00-124.  The 

Gemcom database comprises 3,261 assay records totalling of 3,569 m of assays for an 

average interval length of 1.09 m.  Drilling by Foran accounts for 1,580 assay records, 

while Cameco drilling accounts for 1,681 assay records.  

 

The Scott Wilson RPA Gemcom database comprises 4,105 records of geology entries 

with descriptions for distance from, distance to, and rock type. 

 

A variety of validation queries and routines were run in Gemcom to help identify data 

entry errors.  The original Gemcom database was found to be in good shape and no 

significant problems were noted.  Scott Wilson RPA also verified a number of data 

records with original assay certificates and drill logs.  No significant discrepancies were 

identified.

CUT-OFF GRADE 

Scott Wilson RPA reviewed the cut-off grades and interpretation done by M'Ore 

Exploration Services for Foran in 1999 and 2000.  Cut-off grades of 1.5% Cu and/or 

4.0% Zn were used to define the main mineralized zones.  Scott Wilson RPA found this 

methodology produced good results in terms of outlining potentially economic material, 

especially in the massive and semi-massive zones.   However, due to the more erratic 

nature of the copper mineralization in the copper stringer zone, the use of an arbitrary 

cut-off grade for interpretation was not appropriate.  The geological boundaries and entire 

intersection in each drill hole in this zone were used instead.  As well, a minimum width 

of three metres was imposed on all zones where the previous interpretation included the 

occasional narrow intersection for the sake of continuity. 

 

GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND 3D SOLIDS 

Diamond drill hole traces with Cu, Zn, Au, and Ag grades and lithology, were plotted 

on grid north-south cross sections, and east-west longitudinal drill sections. The cross 

sections were spaced 50 m apart.  The geological and grade continuity was checked using 

the plotted longitudinal drill sections plus plan views on screen.  The down hole distances 

for each drill hole intersection of the mineralized envelopes were used to provide a 

guideline to create 3D rings, tie lines, and ultimately 3D solids for each of the 

mineralized envelopes.   

 

Figures 17-1 to 17-3 provide examples of the outlines of interpreted wireframes in 

cross section and long section.  Figure 17-4 outlines the areas which have been classified 

as Indicated and Inferred. 

 

ASSAY STATISTICS 

Scott Wilson RPA tagged those assays to be included in the resource estimation.  A 

total of 3,261 assays were identified within the area to be estimated.  Basic statistics for 

uncut Cu and Zn on a zone by zone basis are given in Table 17-2.

CUTTING HIGH GRADE VALUES 

Erratic high grade assays can have a large and disproportionate effect in the 

estimation of the average grade of a deposit.  Graphs were prepared to show the 

distribution of uncut metal values for each mineralized zone.  Scott Wilson RPA's 

interpretation of these graphs suggested minor cutting was necessary.  Cu assays were cut 

to 10.0% Cu (four assays in total) and Zn assays were cut to 25% Zn (four assays in 

total). 

 

COMPOSITING 

Scott Wilson RPA composited drill hole assays to 1.0 m down hole within each 

mineralized zone and for all assays outside the zones.  Composites less then 0.25 m long 

were excluded from the composite database.  Table 17-3 summarizes statistics of the cut 

Cu and Zn composite assays for each zone.

DENSITY 

Scott Wilson RPA received density data for the drill hole intersections within each 

selected wireframe.  A total of 3,261 records were used, with density ranging from 1.3 to 

4.6 for an unweighted average density of 2.97. Density was interpolated throughout the 

block model using the inverse distance squared method.  

 

VARIOGRAPHY, KRIGING PARAMETERS AND BLOCK 
MODEL 

Scott Wilson RPA developed variograms for Cu, Zn, and Ag composites for each 

mineralized zone.  Down hole variograms modeled well while directional variograms 

were less obvious on a single variogram basis (Figures 17-5 to 17-7).  However, after 

examination of numerous variograms at various lag distances and directions, some 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 17-11

consistencies were identified that reflected the geology of the deposit and the kriging 

parameters outlined in Table 17-4 were chosen.  Single and double structure spherical 

models were used with nugget effect derived from the down hole variograms.  Search 

parameters were chosen so that all blocks within the mineralized envelopes had grades 

interpolated. 

 

Zones 3 and 4 were interpolated using inverse distance squared methodology with the 

same search parameters as the other zones.

CALCULATION OF NSR VALUES 

Net Smelter Return (NSR) is the estimate of the value in any specific tonnage of 

mineralized material that would be received by the mine owner after paying costs for 

mining and milling.  It is essentially the revenue that is received for each tonne of 

concentrate that leaves the property.  The NSR considers all transportation, smelting and 

refining, penalties, transportation and insurance that each tonne of concentrate would 

incur. 

 

Using the metal prices listed in Table 17-5, the in-situ Cu and Zn percent values in 

each block of the block model were converted to US$ amounts.  These cash values for Cu 

and Zn were then converted to an NSR using ratios of in-situ values to NSR values for 

each metal.  The ratios were calculated using the parameters listed with the Zn ratio equal 

to 0.45 and the copper ratio equalling 0.55.  Silver and gold do not contribute any 

significant value to the NSR and were not included in the calculations.

CLASSIFICATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES 

Scott Wilson RPA classified the mineral resources at McIlvenna Bay in the block 

model into indicated and inferred categories based on drill hole spacing and apparent 

geological and grade continuity of the mineralized zones.  The classification 

methodology used was the same as developed by Foran.  It quite acceptably accounts for 

geological characteristics and continuity. 

 

Indicated mineral resources are located between L93+00E and L104+00E above the 

2,750 elevation.  Drill hole spacing in this area varies from 40 m to 80 m, on 50 m 

sections.  Inferred mineral resources exist below and to the west of the indicated 



  www.rpacan.com 
SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 17-17

resources along the plunge of the deposit.  Drilling in this area is much more irregularly 

spaced both on and between sections. 

 

SUMMARY OF MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

Table 17-6 lists the mineral resources by zone and category at several NSR cut-offs.  

Scott Wilson RPA recommends that the mineral resource estimate be reported at an NSR 

cut-off of $50.

Notes: 

1. CIM definitions were followed for mineral resources. 
2. Mineral resources are estimated using long-term prices of US$1.50 for Cu and US$0.70 

for Zn. 
3. A minimum mining width of 3.0 metres was used. 
4. Totals may not add correctly due to rounding.

MINERAL RESOURCE VALIDATION 

Scott Wilson RPA applied three methods to validate the block model mineral 

resource including: visual inspection, block statistics versus composite statistics 

comparison, and a comparison with results from an alternative interpolation algorithm.   

 

The block grades were visually compared with the composite grades on sections and 

plans and were found to have good overall correlation.  It is noted that the grade 

interpolation profiles should be reviewed and revised when new data become available.  

 

The composite assays within the Len 2 massive zone average 0.25% Cu and 7.13% 

Zn.  This compares to the overall average block grade (at a zero cut-off) of 0.31% Cu and 

6.78% Zn.  In the Upper West the composites average 2.24% Cu and 4.18% Zn, while the 

blocks average 1.97% Cu and 4.10% Zn.  It is Scott Wilson RPA's opinion that the 

difference in the two estimates are within acceptable limits. 

 

In addition to the kriging interpolation method, Scott Wilson RPA estimated the 

mineral resource at McIlvenna Bay using the Inverse Distance method to the power of 

two.  Table 17-7 lists the results.  It is Scott Wilson RPA's opinion that the difference in 

the two estimates are well within acceptable limits.

COMPARISON WITH FORAN 2000 RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

Scott Wilson RPA compared the results of the current estimate with the Foran NSR 

estimate completed in 2000.  The comparison in Table 17-8 shows that the two estimates 

are very similar for the indicated category above cut-off grade.  The tonnages are 

essentially the same, while the Scott Wilson RPA Cu grades have decreased slightly.  The 

decrease in the Cu grades can be partly explained by the inclusion of some lower grade 

material when the Lens 2 and Upper West zone solids are adjusted to the minimum 

mining width of three metres. 

 

The Copper Stringer Zone does not appear in the Scott Wilson RPA resource estimate 

because of the cut-off used.

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
A significant mineral resource has been estimated for the McIlvenna Bay property as 

summarized in Table 17-1.  Indicated resources total 6,671,000 t at a grade of 0.87% Cu, 

6.51% Zn, and 26.0 g/t Ag.  Inferred resources total 6,000,000 t at a grade of 0.83% Cu, 

5.89% Zn, and 24.8 g/t Ag.  These numbers differ from the historic resource estimation 

by Foran in 2000 largely because the higher cut off used by Scott Wilson RPA eliminates 

much of the Copper Stringer zone from either category. 

 

More fill-in diamond drilling is required to upgrade the mineral resources and to trace 

their extension down plunge to the northwest. 

 

Given the advanced stage of this project, it would be reasonable to carry out a 

preliminary assessment/scoping study after the completion of the next phase of drilling.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 
A nine hole, 9,600 m drilling program is recommended as outlined in the budget in 

Table 20-1. The pierce points of the proposed holes are shown on the Longitudinal 

Section, Figure 20-1. The purpose of the drilling is to tighten up drill hole spacings so 

that mineral resources might be upgraded and to explore the down plunge extension of 

the McIlvenna Bay sulphide deposit (to the northwest). Upon completion of the proposed 

drilling, the current resource estimate should be updated and a preliminary 

assessment/scoping study carried out. 

 

Contingent on the results of the preliminary assessment, a Phase 2 drilling program 

should be considered to acquire mineralized material for metallurgical test work. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA recommends that a rigorous program of QA/QC be instituted for 

the next phase of drilling.

ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES, TSL ASSAYERS 

GOLD 
Gold samples were assayed using standard Fire Assay procedures.  Samples were 

fused with a flux mixture of litharge, soda, borax, silica, and fluorospar.  The resulting 
lead button containing the gold was cupelled and subsequently dissolved in aqua regia 
and analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry.  If the resulting sample 
exceeded 3 g/t gold, a gravimetric assay was then done on the sample in which the fused 
cupelled lead button was instead parted by dilute nitric acid and the gold decanted with 
deionized water, dried, annealed and weighted on a microbalance. 
 

SILVER 
Silver analyses were completed on 4.00 grams of pulverized rock which was digested 

with 3:1 HCl/HNO3 and then diluted with 1:1 HCl.  The resulting solution was analyzed 
by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. 
 

COPPER, LEAD, ZINC 
Copper, lead, and zinc analyses were determined from 0.500 grams of the pulverized 

rock, digested with 3:1 HCl/HNO3.  The resulting solution was diluted and analyzed by 
Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. 
 

IRON, SULPHUR 
Iron was analyzed by digesting a 1 gram pulverized portion by 3:1 HCl/HNO3.  The 

resulting solution was diluted and analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry.  
Sulphur was analyzed using a Leco SC-12 IR Detection System.

SUMMARY 
The Hanson Lake 'A' zone sample contains approximately 12% sphalerite in 65% 

pyrite with a mesh of liberation of about 50 microns (270 mesh). There is also present up 
to 1% chalcopyrite which must be separated in order to produce a readily saleable zinc 
concentrate. 

 
A zinc concentrate grading approximately 54% Zn at a recovery of around 90% can 

be produced from the 'A' zone by careful, slow flotation. Three stages of zinc cleaning are 
required. The zinc concentrate is favourably low in magnesia, silica and minor element 
impurities, with the exception of mercury at 200 ppm. 

 
One flotation test was run using Hanson Lake water. There was no significant 

difference between this test and a similar test run using normal Trail water. 
 
The copper impurity cleans up readily to produce a saleable grade copper concentrate 

carrying significant gold and silver values. 
 
The tailings may be treated by single stage cycloning to produce a sand product 

potentially suitable for mine backfilling. The weight recovery to the sand product is 
approximately 75%. 

 
The tailings product remained stable over a four week testing period. It maintains a 

pH of 7.3 to 7.4 with favourably low copper, zinc and iron heavy metals in solution. 
 
Preliminary testing of material from the high-copper 'C' section of the deposit shows 

that a high grade copper concentrate may be produced at good recovery. 
 
Preliminary testing of material from the mixed copper-zinc 'B' zone of the deposit 

shows significant cross-contamination between copper and zinc. It is concluded that a 
significant metallurgical testing program will be required to develop an optimum 
metallurgy for this material.

DETAILS 
1. Test Samples 
The following Hanson Lake project samples were received from CAMECO on July 

30, 1990: 
 
 

 Wt. kg Cu Pb Zn Fe 

"A" Zone 220 0.28 0.5 6.3 28.2 
"B" Zone 62 2.6 0.37 2.7 17.9 
"C" Zone 57 2.3 0.03 0.37 9.0 

 
The as-received sample was delivered as -0.5 cm crushed reject material. It was stage 

crushed to pass 7 mesh using a Denver 6" rolls crusher. The -7 mesh individual samples 
were blended by riffling, split into 2 kg test samples and stored in sealed, polyethylene 
buckets until required for testing. 

 
 
2. Expected Metallurgy 
Two locked cycle tests were completed on the' A' zone sample. Neither test 

duplicated the desired metallurgy. The first test left the zinc scavenger circuit open 
circuited. The second test gave relatively poor zinc-iron selectivity due the use of higher 
reagent levels in an attempt to achieve faster flotation kinetics. 

 
The expected range of concentrate grades and recoveries is shown in the following 

two tables with open and closed zinc scavenger cleaner tailings, respectively. The 
flotation circuit used in the first locked cycle test is shown in Figure 1 (Appendix B).

By simulation, the following changes were made: 
1. Zinc scavenger cleaner concentrate recycled to zinc 2nd cleaner feed. 
2. Zinc scavenger cleaner tailings recycled to zinc rougher feed. 
 
These data show that with careful zinc roughing and cleaning a zinc concentrate 

grading 54% zinc and 1% copper should be produced at a recovery between 89% and 
94%. The recovery value of 89% assumed by CAMECO in their feasibility estimate is 
considered to be realistically attainable with careful flotation practice. 

 
 
3. Flotation Residence Time 
In order to achieve high zinc/ iron selectivity, a slow zinc rougher-scavenger flotation 

step is required. Residence times used in the bench scale locked cycle test are shown in 
Table 3.

4. Recycle Rates 
Recycle rates for each stage of zinc flotation from the first locked cycle test are 

shown in Table 4. It is often found that actual plant cleaner stage recycles are higher than 
is observed in bench locked cycle testing. For the purposes of detailed mill design, an 
allowance for up to three times the observed bench test recycles should be made. 

 
TABLE 4 

Recycle Rates - Zinc Circuit (From LCT #1) 
 
    Zinc Rougher  108% 
    Zinc 1st Cleaner 138% 
    Zinc 2nd Cleaner 122% 
    Zinc 3rd Cleaner 100% 
 
    Recycle Rate = Stage Feed + Recycles

   MIBC   0.023  As required 
   Lime   0.5  To zinc cleaners 
 
 
6. Open Circuit Flotation Tests 'A' Zone Sample 
Thirty-six open flotation tests were carried out on the 'A' zone sample. The purpose of 

these tests was to evaluate alternative reagent schemes for optimization of zinc flotation 
grade and recovery. One other test (HL001B05) was carried out using water from Hanson 
Lake. No significant change in metallurgy was observed (Figure 3). A compilation of 
these tests is included as Appendix A. 

 
7. Locked Cycle Testing 'A' Zone Sample 
 
Two locked cycle tests were completed on the 'A' zone sample. 
 
Details of these tests are included as Appendix B.

8. Concentrate Minor Elements Analysis 
The final zinc concentrate from locked cycle Test 1 and combined copper concentrates 
from the two locked cycle tests were assayed according to standard classical and 
instrumental techniques for payable and deleterious minor elements. The results from 
these analyses are given in Appendix C. 

 
 
9. Zinc Concentrate Filtration Testing 
Pressure filtration testing was completed on zinc concentrate produced from the first 

locked cycle test using a LAROX Model lA pressure filter with a filtration area of 50 
cm2. A best concentrate moisture of 7% was achieved using an air blow of 7 minutes and 
a cake dry weight loading of 15 kg/m2. Test details are given in Appendix D. Test results 
show high variability due to the poor sample handling characteristics of the small filter. 

 
Pressure filtration design data would require a sample of several kilograms tested 

using the Larox 0.1 m2 test unit available through Larox or the equivalent unit available 
through Ingersol Rand, the Canadian representative for the competing Lasta filter. Filtra 
Systems also provide testing facilities for the Vertipress Filter. 

 
 
10. Tailinqs Sand Backfill 
 
Flotation tailings from the locked cycle test were classified through one pass of a 1" 

Mozley cyclone operating at 67 kPa. A sands weight recovery of 75% was achieved. The 
sands gave a percolation rate of 4.5 cm/hr using a 2.5 cm diameter by 30 cm column 
packed by gravity flow into the column. 

 
The slimes were settled without flocculation to give the settling curve shown in 

Figure 5. Slimes weight was 100 g to give a terminal density of 500 g/L. 
 
Details of the cycle backfill separation are given in Appendix E. 
 
 
11. Tailings Filtration 
Testing was also carried out for a paste backfill separation. Tailings were deslimed by 

multiple bucket decantation and the resultant sands filtration characteristics determined 
by vacuum filter leaf testing. A filtration rate of approximately 300 kg/m2/hr was 
achieved after desliming using a 30 cfm cloth. Details are given in Appendix F. 

 
 
12. Tailings Stability Testing 
 
Tailings produced from flotation test HL001B32 was used for a tailings pond 

simulation. After completion of the test and sampling the tailings for moisture and 
analysis, the tailings filter cake was repulped in the rougher tailings filtrate and allowed 
to stand. The results of pH, zinc, copper and iron are shown in Figure 8 (Appendix G). 
These results are favourable.

13. Preliminary Flotation Testing - Hanson Lake Zone 'B' Sample 
 
Two flotation tests have been completed on the Hanson Lake 'B' zone sample. These 

show recovery of 73% of the copper to the copper concentrate together with 14% of the 
zinc. Overall recovery of the zinc was poor with 27% of the zinc in the tailings. These 
results are included as Appendix H. 

 
These tests suggest that obtaining saleable concentrates at good recoveries from the B 

zone material will be a challenge and should not be taken as given in the project financial 
plan. 

 
 
14. Preliminary Flotation Testinq - Hanson Lake Zone 'C' Sample 
 
Three flotation tests have been completed on the Hanson Lake 'C' zone sample. These 

show good copper recovery (95%) to the copper concentrate with only minor 
contaminating zinc. Good copper metallurgy should be expected with this material, based 
on the limited amount of test work to date. These results are included as Appendix I. 

 
 
15. Calculated Metallurgical Balance - project Phase II 
 
As estimated metallurgical balance was prepared based on the treatment of equal 

proportions of zone A and zone C feed. A simple linear combination model was assumed 
based on the absence of alteration observed in the samples provided by CAMECO. The 
results of this balance are included as Appendix J.
