1.0 SUMMARY 
 
The Fortin Property (the "Property") is approximately 80 km northeast of the City of 
Val-d'Or, Quebec, in the central part of Ducros Township, between the municipalities 
of Senneterre and Lebel-sur-Quévillon. The Property lies between Provincial Highway 
113 and the western shore of Lac Parent within National Topographic System, Map 
Sheet 32C/11, and consists of five (5) contiguous mining claims that form a north-
south elongated block of 1.3 kilometres by 1.6 kilometres. Nunavik Nickel Mines Ltd. 
owns a 100% interest in all 5 of these claims, which cover 211.3 hectares.  
 
Pursuant to a Property Transfer Agreement dated November 9, 2010, between 
Golden Valley Mines Ltd. and Nunavik Nickel Mines Ltd. (a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Golden Valley Mines as of the date of this Report), Golden Valley Mines Ltd. sold, 
assigned and transferred all legal and beneficial interest in and to the Fortin Prospect 
to Nunavik Nickel Mines Ltd. in consideration for which Nunavik Nickel Mines Ltd. 
issued to Golden Valley Mines Ltd. common shares in its capital. A 1.5 % net smelter 
royalty (NSR) granted to the original vendors by Golden Valley Mines Ltd. remains in 
place. Nunavik Nickel Mines Ltd. retains buyback discretion of the NSR at any time 
(0.5 % buyback for $500,000 and 1% buyback for $1,000,000).  
 
The Property is located in the southeast part of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, in the 
area of the Lebel-sur-Quevillon Mining Camp, which is host to a number of significant 
gold and base-metal deposits including Osbell (Au), Barry (Au), Merimac/Bousecour 
(Au), Barraute-Swanson (Au), Abcourt (Zn-Ag) and Vermont Zinc (Zn-Ag). The 
Abitibi Greenstone Belt extends for over 500 kilometres from Timmins, Ontario to 
Chibougamau, Quebec in the Abitibi Sub-province of the Canadian Shield. It is one of 
the largest greenstone belts in the world, and one of the most productive gold and 
base-metal regions. 
 
Initial interest in the area around the Property followed the discovery of sulphides 
and iron formation, first noted in 1935 and outlined in 1953-54 by Atlas Sulphur Co. 
Exploration was performed in the area proximal to the current Property periodically 
from 1953 to 1965, from 1974 to 1988, and from 1998 to 2002, and included 
ground- and airborne-geophysical surveys, diamond-drilling, trenching, prospecting, 
sampling and lithogeochemical surveys. Current interest is concentrated around two 
known showings; the Ducros Pyroxenite Showing (Cu-Ni-PGE) and the Ducros Gold 
Showing (Au).  
 
The area surrounding the Fortin Property is underlain by metamorphosed mafic 
volcanic flows and gabbroic intrusions that are overlain by metasedimentary rocks 
with greywacke, argillite and siltstone protoliths. These rocks have been locally 
intruded by ultramafic rocks (peridotite, dunite, pyroxenite and gabbro). The entire 
sequence has been compressed between vast tonalitic and granodioritic plutons that 
are locally highly metamorphosed to migmatitic gneiss.  
 
The region around Lebel-sur-Quevillon is well known for its mining heritage, and 
current gold and base-metal operations and infrastructure. An experienced mining 
work force, along with mining/exploration services and equipment, are readily 
available from the nearby mining centres of Val-d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda. 
 
The Property is accessible by Provincial Highway 113, which connects to the Trans 
Canada Highway (Route 117), some 30 kilometres east of Val-d'Or. The Maheux 
Transportation Company operates bus services between Val-d'Or and Chibougamau 



 Fortin Technical Report 5 
 

 

via Senneterre and Lebel-sur-Quevillon. Both Val-d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda maintain 
municipal airports, with scheduled air service to Montreal and other local centres. 
 
Although the Fortin Property has been explored extensively in the area of the known 
showings, there remain prospective targets for testing within this favourable 
geological setting. The proposed exploration program on the Property comprises: 

1. The area around the exposed parts of the Fortin sill (Ducros Pyroxenite 
showing) should be bulldozed (if necessary) and stripped;  

2. In order to classify and thereby better determine the mineralization model, 
the Fortin Sill should be investigated to determine its size, shape, thickness, 
layering (if any), texture (cumulate?, mesocumulate?, adcumulate?), the 
nature of its margins (poikilitic?, recrystallized?), grain size(s) (parent and 
margins), geometry within the local stratigraphy, and chemical composition 
(whole rock, MgO content of parent and margin, modal olivine); 

3. Detailed mapping, geophysical interpretation and, if necessary, diamond-
drilling should be employed to determine the extent of the Fortin Sill on the 
Property; 

4. Following its delineation, Pionjar, Winkie and diamond-drills should be used to 
systematically sample the sill and its contact zone in the surrounding host 
rocks, over its entire extent. Emphasis should be placed on investigating the 
source of the IP conductors both within and at the margins of the ultramafic 
unit; 

5. The area around the gold occurrence should be bulldozed (if necessary) and 
stripped, and a detailed channel sampling of the exposed area instigated;  

6. Ground prospecting in conjunction with detailed ground geophysical surveys 
(IP) are recommended in order to help identify favourable areas for 
structurally controlled quartz vein-hosted gold mineralization along the shear 
zone that is exposed at the known occurrence. If warranted, follow-up 
geological mapping, prospecting and diamond drilling should then be 
completed; 

7. Historic diamond-drilling by Brominco (1978) targeted a strong geophysical 
anomaly and coincident B-horizon soil anomaly in the northeastern part of the 
Property, intersected anomalous concentrations of Cu, Zn, Ni and Au. It is 
recommended that this area be re-investigated; 

8. At the moment no computerized database exists for the historical data 
completed on the Property. In order to better understand the geology, 
mineralization (type, form and distribution), alteration (type and distribution) 
and geometry (i.e., shape and size) of the mineralized features, it is strongly 
recommended that a comprehensive, digital, 3D geological model and 
database be assembled. The purpose of this work would be used to formulate 
a model on the geological and mineralizing controls for future drill-testing 
along the predicted sub-surface and along-strike locations of mineralization. 

 
The proposed exploration program would require a budget of $276,000. If results 
warrant, a Phase II $360,000 follow-up diamond-drilling program, utilizing large 
diameter coring, is recommended.

The Property is located in the east part of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, which extends 
for over 500 kilometres from Timmins, Ontario to Chibougamau, Quebec in the 
Abitibi Sub-province of the Canadian Shield (Figure 4). It is one of the largest 
greenstone belts in the world, and one of the most productive gold and base-metal 
regions. The Fortin Property is in the area of the Lebel-sur-Quevillon Mining Camp, 
which is host to a number of significant gold and base-metal deposits including 
Osbell (Au), Barry (Au), Merimac/Bousecour (Au), Barraute-Swanson (Au), Abcourt 
(Zn-Ag) and Vermont Zinc (Zn-Ag). 
 
Interest in the Property centres on two adjacent but distinct mineral occurrences: 1) 
Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization exposed on a small outcrop (65 m x 25 m) of pyroxenite 
(Ducros Pyroxenite Showing), and; 2) gold in quartz veins associated with a zone of 
high-strain, exposed on a similar sized outcrop (Ducros Gold Showing), some 25 m 
to the east (Figure 6 and Figure 7 appended to end of Report). A significant 
amount of exploration activity was completed in the area of the Property periodically 
from 1953 to 2005. Work mainly included geophysical surveys and follow-up drilling 
and was concentrated on nearby occurrences (see 6.0 History section for details). 
 
4.1 Property Agreements 
 
On November 8, 2004, Golden Valley announced an agreement to acquire a 100% 
interest in the Fortin Prospect, which consists of five (5) mining claims 
(approximately 200 hectares), in Ducros Township, Québec, located approximately 
87 kilometres north of Val-d'Or. The terms of the property acquisition agreement 
included a cash payment to the vendors of $5,000, the issuance of 50,000 common 
shares of Golden Valley Mines Ltd. to the vendors over an 18-month period and a 1.5 
% net smelter royalty (NSR) granted to the vendors.  
 
Pursuant to a property transfer agreement dated November 9, 2010, Golden Valley 
Mines Ltd. sold, assigned and transferred all legal and beneficial interest in and to 
the Fortin Prospect to Nunavik Nickel Mines Ltd. in consideration for which Nunavik 
issued to Golden Valley Mines Ltd. common shares in its capital. Nunavik Nickel 
Mines Ltd. retains buyback discretion of the NSR at any time (0.5 % buyback for 
$500,000 and 1% buyback for $1,000,000).  
 
4.2 Environmental liabilities  
 
Prior to Nunavik Nickel's involvement, the Property had been explored by airborne- 
and surface-geophysical surveys, sampling/prospecting programs that included grid-
cutting, trenching and sampling programs, and diamond-drilling. There are few 
vestiges of this previous work, and no environmental issues related to said 
exploration programs.  
 
As of the writing of this report, the Author is not aware of encumbrances or 
environmental liabilities to which the Property could be subject. Golden Valley and 
Nunavik Nickel have ensured the author that all exploration programs on the 
property have been and shall be conducted in an environmentally sound manner, 
and will follow, to the best of their abilities, the principles and guidelines outlined in 
the E3 Framework Document for Responsible Exploration 
(http://www.pdac.ca/e3plus/index.aspx).

4.3 Work permits 
 
The author understands that Golden Valley Mines applied for, and was granted all 
permitting requirements to proceed with all the work performed to date.  
 
In order to complete the recommended work on the Property in the future, Nunavik 
Nickel will be required to obtain a Land Use Permit (for ground exploration and 
drilling activities) from the Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune 
(MRNF) de Quebec.   
 
 
5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, PHYSIOGRAPHY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES AND 
INFRASTRUCTURES 
 
The Property is accessible by Provincial Highway 113, which is coincident with the 
western Property boundary and which connects to the Trans Canada Highway (Route 
117), some 30 kilometres east of Val-d'Or. The Maheux Transportation Company 
operates bus services between Val-d'Or and Chibougamau via Senneterre and Lebel-
sur-Quevillon. Both Val-d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda maintain municipal airports, with 
scheduled air service to Montreal and other local centres. 
 
The physiography of the area is fairly flat-lying with little topographic relief and large 
wetlands. Average elevation is around 320 metres (1050 ft) above sea-level. The 
area is mostly covered with glacial till and drift, with a few outcrops exposed as small 
mounds with positive relief in the north-central part of the Property. The Property is 
drained by the Bell River from Lac Parent. Vegetation is boreal, consisting mostly of 
black spruce, poplar, and birch trees, and various shrubs, mosses and lichen. 
 
Climatic conditions are typical for the Canadian Shield, with short, mild summers and 
long, cold winters. Mean temperatures range from -17°C in January, to +18°C in 
July. The mean annual precipitation throughout the region ranges from 812 mm to 
876 mm.  
 
Power is readily accessible from a hydro line 25 km south, along Route 113. 
 
The region around Lebel-sur-Quevillon is well known for its mining heritage, and 
current gold and base-metal operations and infrastructure. An experienced mining 
work force, along with mining/exploration services and equipment, are readily 
available from the nearby mining centres of Val-d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda. 
 
The operating season for the project is year-round. No potential encumbrances for 
future mining operations are expected based on the sufficiency of surface rights for 
potential waste disposal areas, heap leach pad areas and potential processing plant 
sites in addition to the near-by availability and sources of power, water and mining 
personnel.

6.0 HISTORY 
 

NOTE: The online "E-Sigeom" resource (http://sigeom.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/) 
provides access to the information holdings of the Ministère des Ressources 
naturelles et de la Faune (MRNF) de Quebec, and is the principal repository 
for historical information on the Province's mineral resources. Spatial and 
attribute search functionality allows for rapid discovery of information from 
reports, maps, and client-submitted Assessment Reports or "Gestimes 
Minieres" (GM's). A "GM" number, is a reference number to which an 
Assessment File or similar document is assigned by MRNF once a Report has 
been accepted. GM files are accessible online at 
https://gestim.mines.gouv.qc.ca/.  
 
In this Section, the relationship between sample lengths and true thickness is 
not known. All reported intervals are intersection widths, not true widths.  

 
Records of work reported for the Fortin Property area date from as far back as 1935, 
to as recently as 2005. The author has reviewed the available historical work and 
verified the information contained in Assessment Reports that pertain to the Fortin 
claim block. A summary of the pertinent Assessment Report files is presented below. 
References in italics are the alpha-numeric code assigned to various documents by 
the MRNF de Quebec, and accessible through E-Sigeom.

Summary Report on the Regional geology around the Lac Parent area for the Quebec 
Department/Bureau of Mines (RASM 1935-C1, RP 108, RP 108-A). The Report 
mentions the presence of numerous pyrite showings discovered by prospectors.  
 
1948 Geophysical Survey of Canada (GM14683) 
Airborne geophysical magnetic survey of Lac Parent area GSC Map 94-G revealed a

1953-54 Atlas Sulphur and Iron Company (GM02377 and excerpts from 
GM47268) 
An exploration campaign by Atlas Sulphur and Iron Company covered a major, 
north-trending sulphide horizon that extends for some 10 kilometres (6.25 miles) 
from Delestre Township to Ducros Township across the islands on Lake Parent.  
 
A 13 million* ton (Mt) iron-sulphide deposit (Delandore) was outlined in the Delestre 
Township, near the Brassier River, by 5,514 metres (18,089 feet) of diamond-
drilling.  
 
*The author was not able to verify this resource figure. The information is not 
necessary indicative of the mineralization on the property that is the subject of this 
report. The above information pertains to the Delandore property and not the 
Property that is the subject of this Technical Report.  
 
A number of significant assays for gold are reported, reaching 18.51 grams per ton 
(g/t) or 0.54 ounces per ton (oz/t) in the core, and 26.74 g/t (0.78 oz/t) in the drill 
cutting (sludge). Some of these gold values were obtained in secondary quartz 
carbonate veins; however, composite samples of the iron sulphide from the deposit 
showed only traces values of gold.

1974 Quebec Department of Natural Resources 
Questor Surveys Ltd. produced an airborne Input MK VI survey of the region in 1974 
(DP 237, DP 728 and DP 764). The survey outlined a large number of 
electromagnetic anomalies in the area including two strong trends on the Fortin 
property.  
 
1977-80 GM33191 (Husson, B. and Mongeau, C.), GM34257 (Berube, M.), 
and GM42864 (Larouche, C.) 
In December 1976 and July 1977 Brominco Inc. completed an EM-16 ground 
geophysical survey on their property adjacent to the eastern boundary of the current 
Fortin Property. Some work overlapped the current claims. Conductors 4 and 7 were 
outlined on current claim 5230562 and were subsequently drilled by holes BD-78-5 
and BD-78-6 respectively (GM34257). Slightly anomalous concentrations of Cu, Zn, 
Ni and Au were present in hole BD-78-5, which targeted a coincident B-horizon soil 
anomaly and conductor. Hole 6 returned no significant sulphide or precious metal 
values. According to GM42864 , the anomalies were explained by drill-intersections 
of graphite, pyrite-pyrrhotite with local traces of chalcopyrite, magnetite, and 
arsenopyrite. 
 
1986 GM43618 (Campbell, R.A.) 
June 13, 1986, an airborne geophysical survey was carried out on the property of 
Abitibi Resources Ltd. in Ducros Township, Quebec. Magnetic and VLF-
electromagnetic data was collected by H. Ferderber Geophysics Ltd. A total of 127.6 
line miles of data were collected. The magnetic survey delineated a north-striking, 
magnetic-high near the northeastern boundary of property. It was thought that it 
could represent a small zone of iron formation located north of the contact with a 
known small mafic intrusive body. The VLF-EM survey outlined several conductive 
zones that correlated well with the magnetic highs. Conductive bands B,C and D 
underlie the current claim group and are coincident with small magnetic highs. Band 
D is folded and could represent a contact between the volcano-sedimentary rocks 
and the mafic intrusion. Zone C is located near a creek and could be caused by 
conductive overburden. Conductor E strikes roughly east-west and appears to cut-off 
conductor A. It may represent a small cross-cutting shear zone. 
 
1987 GM44380 (Barrie, C.Q.) 
Airborne magnetic and VLF-EM survey was flown by Terraquest Ltd, for Exploration 
Cardumont Inc. in January 1987. The survey outlined a number of strong Total Field 
magnetic anomalies coincident with quadrature (conductive) responses, interpreted 
as stratabound mineralogical horizons, overburden responses, and fault zones. The 
very strong magnetic anomalies were interpreted as iron formation or, less likely, as 
being related to highly concentrated horizons of pyrrhotite. The mafic to intermediate 
metavolcanic rocks had moderate magnetic responses, and the clastic sediments 
exhibited weak to moderate responses. It was supposed that magnetic horizons

within both these units were probably related to increased concentrations of 
magnetic minerals such as pyrrhotite or magnetite, or possibly to mafic horizons. 
 
1987 GM47267 and GM45155 (Gaucher, E.) 
An evaluation report in early 1987 (GM47267) was followed by a ground IP survey 
by Geosig Inc. for Abitibi Resources Ltd., that covered all of lots 54 to 60 (western 
part of the property) on a 400 metres (1,312 feet) line spacing grid. The survey done 
at one separation, and a 25 metres (82 feet) dipole, outlined several 100 to 300 
metres (328 to 984 feet) wide highly anomalous outcrops areas probably reflecting 
massive and disseminated sulphides, whose central conductive core correspond to 
the Input conductors. In the south, the conductive overburden is deeper and the 
important swarm of Input anomalies in the south-west corner was detected only in a 
subdued manner by the 25 metre dipole used (Gaucher, E., Geosig Inc., 1987). A 
new grid was cut with line spacing at 100 metres followed by a magnetometric 
gradiometric survey.

to test the anomaly was recommended.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
7.1 Regional Geology 
 
The Property is located in the southeastern part of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt (AGB), 
within the Eastern Superior Province of the Precambrian Canadian Shield. The Abitibi 
Greenstone Belt is characterized by numerous Archean volcano sedimentary belts 
and igneous intrusive complexes that are in some places cross-cut by generally 
northeast-striking, Proterozoic diabase dykes. The rocks are locally metamorphosed 
to greenschist and amphibolite facies.  
 
The AGB extends in a north-easterly direction for approximately 700 kilometres 
between the gneissic rocks of the Kapuskasing Uplift in the west and the 
Mesoproterozoic Grenville Province in the east. The belt is about 300 kilometres 
wide, measured at right angles to its strike, and averages about 500 kilometres in 
length making it the largest known greenstone belt, in the world. There are many 
fault zones and deformation corridors within the AGB. The Cadillac-Larder Lake Fault 
Zone and the Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone are the major, tectonic, gold-deposition 
structures.  
 
The Abitibi Greenstone Belt is subdivided into the Northern Volcanic Zone and the 
Southern Volcanic Zone along the Destor-Porcupine-Manneville (DPM) Fault Zone, 
which is interpreted to be the locus of Archean terrane-docking between the older 
(2730-2710 Ma) diffuse volcanic arc of the Northern Volcanic Zone and the younger 
(2705-2698 Ma) arc segments of the Southern Volcanic Zone (Chown et al., 1992; 
Mueller et al., 1996).  
 
7.2 Local Geology 
 
The Fortin Property is located within the Southern Volcanic Zone of the AGB in a 
narrow, northwest-trending neck of volcano-sedimentary rocks enclosed to the 
northeast and southwest by large, mainly granitic stocks (Figure 4). The volcano-
sedimentary rocks are comprised mainly of intermediate and mafic volcanic rock, 
intimately associated with gabbro and diorite sills and dykes. Lesser amounts of 
greywacke, shale, iron formation and felsic volcanic rocks are present. Large felsic 
volcanic (granitic and dioritic) stocks intrude the sequence along with "late", 
northeast-trending diabase dykes. Local metamorphic grade around the plutons 
reached middle amphibolite facies; however, the regional metamorphic grade is 
greenschist.  
 
 



 Fortin Technical Report 20 
 

 

7.3 Property Geology 
 
Based on limited exposures, diamond-drill logs and core, and geophysical survey 
results, the Property is interpreted to be mainly underlain by a north-northeast 
striking sequence of intermediate and mafic volcanic rocks, bounded on the east and 
west by fine-grained sedimentary rocks and iron formation. The volcano-sedimentary 
package includes minor rhyolite, tuff and associated felsic pyroclastic rocks. A 
gabbro-pyroxenite intrusion in the northwest part of the claim-group is the loci of the 
Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization (Figure 6 and Figure 7 appended to end of Report). A 
second surface showing, 75 m to the northeast, contains quartz veins with 
anomalous gold mineralization in a well-developed shear zone. 
 
The Property is underlain by a northwest-striking units of highly altered volcano-
sedimentary rocks. The two main strata consist essentially of: 1) metamorphosed 
clastic sedimentary rocks interbedded with minor mafic to felsic metavolcanic rock, 
and; 2) mainly metavolcanic rocks and associated pyroclastics interbedded with 
minor clastic metasedimentary rocks. The younger, mainly sedimentary, sequence is 
host to at least one Algoma-type iron formation. Established trenches reveal that the 
iron formations are composed mainly of massive to disseminated sulphides (pyrite, 
pyrrhotite) and oxides (magnetite). The occurrence of two apparently separate bands 
of  iron formation near the western and eastern boundaries of the Property, is likely 
the result of folding geometry, rather than a repetition of stratigraphy. 
 
The iron formation is hosted by a commonly brecciated, impure quartzite that 
exhibits a characteristic sugary texture. Locally, conglomeratic sandstone and 
greywacke are interbedded with this unit. The quartzite carries the disseminated- 
and massive-sulphide, and oxide-iron mineralization. In the western part of the claim 
group near the main iron formation, a mineralized ultramafic intrusion, composed of 
serpentinized dunite, has recently been recognized (Figure 6 appended to end of 
Report).  
 
The clastic metasedimentary rocks show a direct positive correlation with linear 
airborne electromagnetic anomalies defined on the Property. Strong magnetic 
anomalies are associated with the iron formation. Geophysical response also defines 
the dunite sill as having a north-south strike, a width of approximately 80 metres, 
and a westerly dip. Other geophysical anomalies in the vicinity of the Property 
represent similar intrusions. All the rocks of the general area have subjected to 
upper greenschist grade metamorphism.  
 
7.4 Structure 
 
The Property is located near the end of a narrow, northwest-trending, deformation 
corridor of volcano-sedimentary rocks, dwarfed by huge granitic stocks to the 
northeast and southwest (Figure 4). No information was found to indicate the 
structural geometry (antiform, synform, facing direction, etc.) of the volcano-
sedimentary rocks. The regional foliation and schistosity strike roughly northwest 
and dip 50° to 80° to the southwest.  
 
Two conjugate fault sets (northeast/southeast and north/north-northeast) 
interpreted by regional lineations studies, transect the area and are reflected in the 
geophysical data (see Figure 8 in GM52381).  
 
 



 Fortin Technical Report 21 
 

 

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
Massive sulphides: 
Massive sulphide occurrences of pyrite and pyrrhotite have been documented in the 
Lac Parent area since the mid-1900's. The known massive sulphide deposits are 
associated with iron formation; numerous bands of graphitic schist with or without 
sulphide mineralization are also known to exist in the area. The graphitic schists, 
mineralized or otherwise, typically manifest as linear IP anomalies. 
 
Iron/sulphides: 
Although there are a number of nearby iron deposits associated with the local iron 
formations, according to a recent Due Diligence Report, the iron formation on the 
Fortin Property does not contain sufficient quantities of sulphide, gold or iron to be of 
economic interest for production.  
 
The sulphide deposits are thought to be syngenetic; however, their depositional 
nature is not certain as the regional metamorphism has likely remobilized, 
recrystallized and transformed the primary sulphides (Husson, 1980 and Mongeau, 
1977). 
 
Gold/Copper: 
There has been no gold or copper production in the area of the Fortin Property; 
however, a number of historical gold and copper occurrences have been 
documented. They occur as: (1) gold-bearing quartz veins, typically hosted by 
intermediate volcanic rocks and syenite bodies, (2) quartz veins bearing chalcopyrite 
and gold in intermediate volcanic rocks, and (3) quartz veins in andesite rock 
containing impressive but erratic amounts of chalcopyrite. 
 
When the iron formations in the area were being explored for iron and sulphides, the 
grab samples and core were rarely assayed for gold. Early gold assays were typically 
very low, with most assays returning only trace concentrations of gold and silver. 
Later drill core from the iron formation targets were not assayed for gold.   
 
Copper/PGE: 
A previously unrecognized ultramafic sill (the "Fortin Sill") has been noted in the 
northern part of the Property, near the western iron formation. The north-striking sill 
is composed mainly of dunite/pyroxenite. Anomalous Cu, Ni, and PGE values have 
been encountered from the ultramafic intrusion and are mostly attributed to the high 
nickel background for this kind of rock. 
 
The Fortin Sill has an estimated width varying from 80 to 600 metres and dips 
toward the west. As nickel and PGE (Platinum Group Elements) are known to be 
associated with ultramafic intrusions, the recognition of the sill warranted a re-
evaluation of the metallogenic concepts and hypothesis for the Property.  
 
A few isolated Input EM (electromagnetic) and Magnetic anomalies are coincident 
with the sill and are interpreted to be caused by sulphide mineralization, directly and 
genetically associated with the ultramafic host rock. The contact between the Fortin 
Sill and the host rocks, which also exhibits good local Input EM (electromagnetic) 
response, is also a promising target zone for mineralization. Chalcopyrite has been 
observed in outcrops near the exposed part of the contact zone. Both in situ and 
remobilized deposits are prime targets in the area of the Fortin Sill.  
 



 Fortin Technical Report 22 
 

 

 
9.0 MINERALIZATION  
 
There are two principle exploration targets on the Property: 1: Cu-Ni-PGE 
mineralization associated with the Fortin Sill, and; 2) gold mineralization in dilatant 
quartz veins associated with high-strain zones.  
 
Cu-Ni-PGE Mineralization: 
The Cu-Ni-PGE mineral occurrence is hosted within a dunite-pyroxenite intrusive 
body exposed at surface over a 24 by 58 metre area. A series of well-mineralized 
gossans are located along the eastern flank of the outcrop, which hosts abundant 
pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite.  
 
The Fortin Sill belongs to the dunite-peridotite class. The known mineralization 
associated with this intrusion falls into the "intrusive-dunite associated" class of 
Marston et al. (1981). Deposits of this type may be further categorized into: a) 
medium sized deposits with high-grade and low-grade ore (e.g., the Agnew – 
formerly Perseverance - deposit in Australia and; b) large sized deposits carrying 
low-grade, disseminated ore, e.g., Mount Keith in Australia. Intrusive dunite- and 
volcanic peridotite-associated deposits are generally restricted to ca. 2,700 Ma 
Archean terrains worldwide. 
 
In the mineralization model envisaged for the Ducros Pyroxenite (Cu-Ni-PGE) 
Showing, the country rock, which contains abundant disseminated sulphide 
mineralization, may have played an important chemical role in assimilation magmatic 
process as the main source of sulphur necessary for the magmatic segregation of the 
ultramafic Fortin Sill. In order to generate a magma rich in magmatic sulphides it is 
necessary that: a) the host magma is saturated in sulphur, and; b) a reasonably 
high proportion of sulphides droplets settle rapidly to form an ore body; slow settling 
will result in a disseminated ore. A higher proportion of immiscible magmatic 
sulphides is possible if the magma assimilates sufficient country rock that contains a 
relatively high sulphur (sulphide) content. The "talcose" altered rocks present at the 
contact of the dunite supports the proposed genetic interpretation (Donaldson, 
1981).  
 
Any mafic and ultramafic intrusions discovered on the Property should be carefully 
prospected for Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization.  
 
Gold Mineralization: 
The gold occurrence is located 75 metres to the northeast within a well-developed 
shear zone exposed over 15 by 60 metre area. Approximately 30% of the exposed 
outcrop of mafic volcanic rock is transected by lenticular quartz veins, slightly 
oblique to the main foliation, with mineralized with pyrite±chalcopyrite, mainly along 
the wall rock contacts.  
 
The style of deformation and mineralization is consistent with other gold 
mineralization in the Val-d'Or area. The gold bearing quartz-tourmaline veins appear 
to be associated with the principal shear and tension faults interpreted in the local 
geology.

10.2 2005 Sampling 
Following the acquisition of the Property, a prospecting and sampling program was 
carried out on the Property in 2005. Ten (10) grab samples were collected from the 
area north of the Ducros Pyroxenite Showing and the Ducros Gold Showing. Results 
are included in Table 3. Locations are shown on Figure 7 (appended to end of 
Report). 
 
10.3 2005 Geophysics 
In 2005 a ground geophysical survey (Mag and MaxMin) was completed on the 
Property. The survey outlined both geological contacts and magnetic horizons, which 
were interpreted as mainly iron formation in the western part of the Property. The 
vertical magnetic gradient format significantly improves the resolution and shows 
several minor patterns not clearly resolvable by the total magnetic field data, 
including a notable anomaly associated with the Fortin Sill (GM62129). 
 
10.4 2006 Geophysics 
In 2006 a ground geophysical survey (IP) completed on the Property (GM62428). 
The survey (11.8 line kilometres) outlined geological contacts and resistive and 
conductive horizons comprising possible mineralized (pyrrhotite) and graphitic zones. 
The results from the 2006 IP survey are consistent with the many previous 
geophysical surveys, which show strong magnetic and IP anomalies, with principal 
north-northwest trends. 
 
10.5 2006 Geophysics Interpretation 
In 2006, L. Plante completed an interpretation of the previous ground geophysical 
surveys by Golden Valley. The unpublished report recommends targets for a 
diamond-drilling program. The strongest anomalies, located in the western part of

the Property, are interpreted as iron formation primarily on the basis of the 
characteristic responses. "Magnetic overwhelming", by of the magnetic fields is likely 
the cause of the exaggerated anomaly widths. 
 
The mafic to intermediate metavolcanic rocks correlate with moderate magnetic 
responses, and the clastic sedimentary rocks correlate with weak to moderate 
responses. Magnetic horizons within both these units are likely related to increased 
concentrations of magnetic minerals such as pyrrhotite and magnetite, or possibly to 
interlayered mafic volcanic horizons. The mafic/ultramafic intrusions are magnetically 
similar to the metavolcanic rocks; they cannot be readily distinguished solely by 
magnetic mapping. The Fortin Sill correlates with a strong, narrow, vertical-gradient 
magnetic anomaly.  
 
Some of the north-south conductor axes may be related to fault zones. In particular 
the lithological contact between the granite, diabase and sediments to the northeast 
may be a fault contact. The conductivity in faults may be: (a) mineralogical, e.g., 
gouge, graphite and sulphides, or; (b) ionic, i.e., porosity within the fault zone or in 
the overlying conductive overburden. The magnetic data was used to modify and 
update the existing geology and has shown a number of new contacts and faults.  
 
10.6 2007 Sampling 
A limited channel sampling program comprising 36 samples from three (3) channels 
– 2 on the gold showing and one on the southern part of the exposed pyroxenite 
showing - was carried out on the Property in 2007. Results are included in Table 4. 
See Figure 7 (appended to end of Report) for locations of the channels. 
 
 
11.0 Diamond Drilling 
 
In May of 2008 Golden Valley Mines Ltd. completed a seven hole, 639 metre 
diamond-drill program (see Table 5), designed to follow up on the surface sampling 
results and to test geophysical anomalies. Drill Logs are included in Appendix I. 
 
A total of 254 core samples from the seven diamond-drill holes (GCF-08-01 to GCF-
08-07 inclusive) were collected and analyzed. The locations of the drill collars and 
the surface projection of the drill hole traces are shown on Figure 6 and Figure 7. 
 
Three priority induced polarization (IP) anomalies and a horizontal loop 
electromagnetic (HLEM) conductor were selected to test for the projected strike 
extensions of the two showings in the southeast part of the property, whereas three 
holes were designed to test for near surface extensions of the Ducros Pyroxenite (Ni-
Cu-PGE) and Ducros Gold (Au) showings.

DDH GCF-08-01  
 
This drill hole was designed to test an IP anomaly that consisted of a moderate 
chargeability response associated with a zone of high resistivity.  
 
The drill hole first encountered a unit of gabbro that contained a section of feldspar 
porphyry between the core interval of 29.36-30.79 metres. A section of andesite 
followed the gabbro unit. The andesite section contains a felsic dyke between the 
core interval of 74.11-77.90 metres. The hole ended in a massive, homogeneous unit 
of medium- to coarse-grained gabbro. 
 



 Fortin Technical Report 27 
 

 

Shears and folds were observed at different points throughout the gabbro units. 
Weak, moderate and strong biotitization also occurred at different locations 
throughout the gabbro units. 
 
Traces of fine, disseminated pyrite were observed in the felsic dyke. Within the lower 
gabbro unit, from the core interval of 95.64-96.02 metres, traces of pyrrhotite and 
chalcopyrite were recorded within irregular quartz injections. 
 
No significant values of Ni, Cu, Au or Ag were detected in the fifty-three (53) 
samples that were sent for assay. 
 
DDH GCF-08-02 
 
This drill hole was designed to test an HLEM anomaly with a conductance of 50 
Siemens. 
 
A wide unit of massive, medium-grained, dark green gabbro that contains a narrow 
unit of andesite was the first suite of rocks encountered by DDH GCF-08-02. This 
unit was followed by a 45.83 metres (core-length) of sandstone and argillite 
containing sections of quartz porphyry. The log reports a wide shear that runs 
through this sandstone and argillite unit. The shear contains sections of sericitization 
with intervals of weak hematization. The drill hole was stopped within a unit of 
massive, fine-grained gabbro.  
 
At many intervals throughout the sandstone and argillite unit, the log records various 
concentratiobs of pyrrhotite, pyrite and magnetite that range from between 1% to 
"massive sulphide" category. 
 
No significant values of Ni, Cu, Au or Ag were detected in the twenty-four (24) 
samples that were sent for assay. 
 
DDH GCF-08-03 
 
This drill hole was designed to test a well defined moderate chargeability IP anomaly. 
The drill hole was collared 40 metres northeast of DDH GCF-08-02 on the same grid 
line. 
 
The drill hole intersected 3.07 metres of massive, medium- to fine-grained gabbro 
before encountering another part of the same wide section of sandstone and argillite 
that was drilled by DDH GCF-08-02. 
 
The mineralization present in DDH GCF-08-03 ranged from trace disseminated pyrite 
to 12% fine pyrite. Bands of massive sulphide between 1 to 4 centimetres in core-
width were observed within the foliations of the rock at some intervals. The drill hole 
was stopped after entering a unit of massive, fine-grained, dark green gabbro. 
 
No significant values of Ni, Cu, Au or Ag were detected in the twenty-four (24) 
samples that were sent for assay. 
 
DDH GCF-08-04 
 
This drill hole targeted the geology underlying anomalous gold values encountered in 
channel samples.  



 Fortin Technical Report 28 
 

 

 
The drill hole intersected a unit of olivine gabbro before entering a wide section of 
sheared basalt. This section of basalt is intruded by narrow sections of quartz 
porphyry, quartz-gabbro and gabbro at different intervals. At different locations 
within the basalt, there are narrow sections containing white quartz veins with traces 
of pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pyrite.  
 
No significant values of Ni, Cu, Au or Ag were detected in the forty (40) samples that 
were sent for assay. The highest gold value detected was 0.011 g/t Au. 
 
DDH GCF-08-05 
 
This drill hole targeted the geology underlying the Ducros Gold (Au) showing.  
 
The drill hole first encountered olivine-gabbro and then basalt before being stopped 
within a unit of fine- to medium-grained massive gabbro. The units of olivine-gabbro 
and basalt show evidence of moderate to strong shearing.  
 
From the core interval of 7.00-14.00 metres, within the olivine gabbro, the 
mineralization encountered consisted of between 1% to 2% pyrrhotite with traces of 
pyrite. Seven (7) samples, each one of them being one metre long, from this section 
of core returned nickel values that ranged from between 1610 ppm Ni to 2210 ppm 
Ni. The copper values that were coincident with these nickel values ranged from 
between 138 ppm Cu and 680 ppm Cu.  
 
The highest gold value detected in DDH GCF-08-05 was from a 0.38 metre sample 
interval that contained a 5mm quartz mass with chalcopyrite that carried 0.171 g/t 
Au. 
 
DDH GCF-08-06 
 
This drill hole was set up at a point on grid line 100 mE, which is immediately 
proximate to the Ducros Pyroxenite (Ni-Cu-PGE) showing and was designed to 
intersect the strong chargeability IP anomaly associated with this showing. 
 
The drill hole first encountered diorite followed by a unit of medium-grained gabbro 
that graded to a coarse-grained gabbro. The drill hole then intersected a medium-
grained, olivine gabbro followed by another medium-grained gabbro before ending in 
a unit of quartz-gabbro.  
 
Mineralization consisting of up to 3% pyrrhotite with trace to 1% chalcopyrite is 
present within the latter coarse-grained part of the first unit of gabbro and continues 
into the upper part of the unit of olivine gabbro. The mineralization in the latter part 
of the unit of olivine-gabbro is made up of trace to 3% pyrrhotite coincident with 
trace to 1% chalcopyrite before ending as local traces of fine, disseminated 
pyrrhotite in the second unit of medium-grained gabbro.  
 
Twenty eight (28) samples, each one being 1.5 metres long, from this 42 metre long 
section of variously mineralized core returned nickel values that ranged from 
between 739 ppm Ni to 3920 ppm Ni. The copper values that were coincident with 
these nickel values ranged from between 30 ppm Cu and 4770 ppm Cu.  
 
DDH GCF-08-07 



 Fortin Technical Report 29 
 

 

 
This drill hole targeted the geology underlying the Ducros Pyroxenite (Ni-Cu-PGE) 
showing. 
 
The log records that the drill hole entered a medium- to fine-grained, dark green, 
massive gabbro before going through a medium-grained, olivine gabbro. The drill 
hole continued through a medium-grained massive gabbro and then passed through 
a unit of quartz-gabbro before being stopped within a unit of massive basalt. 
 
Mineralization consisting of up to 5% pyrrhotite with chalcopyrite that occurs up to 
2% is present through most of the first gabbro unit and throughout the olivine-
gabbro unit.  
 
The thirty-three (33) consecutive samples, of varying length, that were taken from 
this 23.20 metres of mineralized core carried values that ranged from 0.022 g/t Au 
to 0.404 g/t Au, 344 ppm Cu to 9200 ppm Cu, 654 ppm Ni to 6090 ppm Ni, 0.026 
ppm Pt and 0.453 ppm Pt as well as 0.023 ppm Pd and 0.404 ppm Pd. 
 
Summary of Results 
 
Hole GCF-08-07 and GCF-08-06 that undercut the pyroxenite showing, yielded 
weighted average grade results of 1934 ppm Ni and 1061 ppm Cu (from 19.50-61.50 
m)  over 21.2 metres and 0.4396 ppm Cu, 0.3742 ppm Ni, 0.25 g/t Pt, 0.23 g/t Pd 
and 0.18 g/t Au over 21.20 m (from 4.0-25.20 m down-hole) over 42.0 metres 
respectively. No significant gold values were obtained in the holes testing the Ducros 
Gold Showing; however, anomalous nickel values were interested with an average 
weighted grade of 0.1794 ppm Ni (from 7.0-14.0 metres). No other notable 
mineralization was encountered. 
 
The samples from the drill-core confirms the presence of sulphides including 
anomalous concentrations of nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), platinum (Pt) and palladium 
(Pd) in drill hole GCF-08-07, and anomalous Ni and Cu in drill holes -05 and GCF-08-
06. 
 
In all instances, the relationship between sample lengths and mineralization to true 
thickness is unknown.

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
Nunavik Nickel Mines Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden Valley Mines. As of 
the date of this Report, Nunavik Nickel acquired from Golden Valley Mines a 100% 
interest in the Fortin Property. Although Nunavik Nickel has done no exploration on 
the claims, the following section applies to the most recent work on the Property, 
which was conducted by Golden Valley Mines. Project geologist Denis McNichols of 
Golden Valley Mines supervised all exploration work and was involved in all aspects 
of the fieldwork through the duration of the 2004-08 exploration program.  
 
Two sampling programs were undertaken: 1) grab samples were collected in the field 
to characterize the host rock and approximate metal accumulations in obviously 
mineralized material, and; 2) selective mineralized drill-core intervals from the 2007 
diamond-drilling program were collected. The samples were assayed to quantitatively 
determine elemental concentrations with emphasis on copper, nickel, Platinum Group 
Elements (PGE) and gold.  
 
According to Mr. Rosatelli, grab-, channel- and core-sampling procedures, security of 
samples, sample preparation, and sample analyses were conducted in a satisfactory 
method according to accepted industry standards. In general, intervals to be 
sampled were established based on visibly mineralized core intervals regardless of 
degree of strain, alteration, metamorphism or rock type. The maximum length of 
sample was 1.5 m. Where mineralized zones greater than 1.5 m were encountered, 
multiple samples were obtained. The shortest sampled interval was 0.21 m. In 
addition, higher grade intervals within lower grade intersections were individually 
sampled.  
 
12.1 Grab-channel sampling 
 
Prospecting and collecting of individual rock samples ("grab" sampling) from outcrop 
or boulders was focused on locating mineralized outcrop or boulders within areas 
prioritized as being prospective based on historic work. This type of sampling by its 
nature provides only a characterization of any mineralization found. 
 
The grab samples generally were selected as being representative of either the rock 
type and/or mineralization present. The samples were relatively easy to obtain and 
were considered of good quality (Michael P. Rosatelli, pers. comm.). A unique sample 
number was assigned to each grab sample and recorded on the sample bag, with a 
corresponding sample tag placed in the bag. The sample sites were labelled in the 
field with a sample number recorded on orange flagging tape so that the site may be 
relocated if required. Analytical results for these samples, along with location-
coordinates and descriptions are included in Section 10. 
 
Samples were sealed in sample bags with plastic tie-straps for shipping to the assay 
laboratory.  
 
The author is not aware of any sampling or recovery factors that would impact the 
reliability of results reported from the assayed grab samples. 
 
12.2 Core-sampling 
 
Core from the 2008 Golden Valley Mines Ltd. diamond drill program was logged by 
D. McNichols of Golden Valley Mines Ltd. Core intervals that required sampling were 



 Fortin Technical Report 31 
 

 

marked off and tagged, with sample intervals rarely longer then 6 feet. Half of the 
core was bagged for assay purposes, and the remaining half placed back in the core 
box with its duplicate sample tag for future reference purposes. The submitted 
sample included both pieces of core and fines, carefully collected and placed in a 
plastic bag and sealed. Individual bagged samples were placed in rice shipping bags, 
secured and dropped-off at the laboratory for analysis.  
 
A total of 254 samples were submitted to ALS Chemex Chimitec in Val-d'Or, Quebec. 
Samples were analyzed for: 1) gold, using a standard 30 gram fire assay with an AA 
finish; 2) platinum, palladium, and gold, using a standard 30 gram fire assay with an 
ICP finish, and; 3) multiple-elements (n=33), using a four-acid, ICP-AES method. 
 
Copies of Certificates with analytical results for these samples are included in 
Appendix II. 
 
The author is not aware of any drilling, sampling or recovery factors that would 
impact the reliability of results reported from re-assayed drill core. 
 
 
13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 
 
The Author has reviewed all the publicly available technical data covering historic 
exploration work on the Property. Most of the historically reported lithogeochemical 
sampling was completed on the Property between 1998 and 2002, inclusive. A drill 
program in 1978 by Brominco Inc. yielded some assays from core samples. The 
author is of the opinion that the historic data are of good quality; however, no 
information is available regarding sample preparation or analytical and security 
procedures that might have been implemented were published as the programs were 
deemed to be at an early exploration stage by the previous owners, and were 
obtained prior to the implementation of National Instrument (NI) 43-101 guidelines.  
 
Collection and preparation of the channel, and drill core samples was conducted 
under the direction of Dennis McNichols of Golden Valley Mines Ltd. Once obtained, 
all samples were immediately placed in plastic sample bags, tagged and recorded 
with unique sample numbers and then collected in shipping bags, which were sealed 
with plastic tie straps and remained sealed until opened by ALS. Upon reception at 
ALS, the samples were dried, weighed, crushed and pulverized before analysis.  
the laboratory facility. 
 
Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QAQC) standard operating procedures for 
lithogeochemical analysis of drill core and surface samples obtained from the 
Property consisted of the ALS-Chemex internal QA/QC of their sample preparation 
and assaying, inserting blanks, duplicates and certified standards into the analytical 
process. The process allows for a determination of the accuracy and reproducibility of 
assay results. ALS Chemex has attained ISO 9001:2000 registration at all of its 
North American and Peruvian laboratories as well as the Brisbane, Australia site, with 
Chile and the rest of Australia actively pursuing registration. Recently, ALS were 
accredited to ISO 9001:2000 for North America. ISO 9001:2000 requires evidence of 
a quality management system covering all aspects of our organisation. To ensure 
compliance with this system regular internal audits are undertaken by ALS staff 
members specially trained in auditing techniques. In addition, ALS Chemex is 
currently working towards accreditation to ISO 17025, which provides specific 
assessment of the laboratories' analytical competence for specific analytical 



 Fortin Technical Report 32 
 

 

techniques. The combination of the two ISO standards provides clients complete 
assurance regarding the quality of every aspect of ALS Chemex operations.  
 
ALS-Chemex QA/QC program included the insertion of certified standards that are 
used at the start of preparation procedure to calibrate the equipment. Blind duplicate 
samples are used to verify analytical accuracy, and blanks to measure any 
background contamination in the sample preparation protocol.  
 
The author believes the sampling, sampling preparation, security, and analytical 
procedures employed during the 2004-2008 channel-sampling and core-sampling 
programs meets the standards set out in NI-43-101 and is deemed to have been 
adequate for the level of Property development to date; however, a more rigorous 
QA/QC program is recommended to support future drilling, surface sampling, and 
metallurgical testing.  
 
The adequacy of any values reported by previous exploration is unknown as no 
discussions exists as per sample preparation, security and analytical procedures. 
 
 
14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
The author (QP) did not collect independent samples of drill core for verification as it 
was not deemed necessary since the Property is in the early, grass-roots phase of 
exploration, no resource has been outlined, and no resource estimate was to be 
included in this Report. 
 
From the 2004-07 exploration programs, Golden Valley collected 36 channel samples 
and 254 core samples from seven (7) diamond-drill holes (total of 639 m). The 
Golden Valley samples confirmed the presence of sulphides, including anomalous 
concentrations of nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) in drill 
hole GCF-08-07, and anomalous Ni and Cu in drill holes GCF-08-05, -06 and -07.   
 
Independent verification of the results of the 2004-08 sampling was achieved by 
comparing the results reported by Golden Valley with copies of the original, signed 
Assay Certificates obtained directly from ALS Chemex in Val-d'Or, QC. The two sets 
of Assay Certificates were found to be identical. 
 
The author is not aware of any sampling problems that would impact the accuracy 
and reliability of the original assay results. A review of all the pertinent and available 
assessment files from the Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune (MRNF) 
de Quebec was completed. The author has reviewed the reports containing 
information on the Fortin Property and believes the information to be accurate.  
 
14.1 Site Visit 
 
John Langton, who is completely independent of Golden Valley Mines Ltd. and of 
Nunavut Nickel Ltd., and who is a Qualified Person (QP) under the terms of NI 43-
101, conducted a site visit of the Fortin Property on September 2, 2010 accompanied 
by Michael P. Rosatelli of Golden Valley Mines Ltd. The visit to the site located and 
examined the documented mineral occurrences, checked for and confirmed evidence 
of previous diamond-drilling and lithological sampling, and explored the general 
landscape and surface features recorded on geological maps and figures published by 
Golden Valley Mines Ltd. 



 Fortin Technical Report 33 
 

 

 
Mr. Langton confirms that the exploration activity previously reported by Golden 
Valley to be accurate and reliable. 
 
 
15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
At the time of writing, the author was not aware of any other active exploration 
activities in the immediate area of the Fortin Property. 
 
 
16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
Neither processing nor metallurgical testing has been conducted on the Fortin 
Property. 
 
 
17.0 MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATION 
 
The Fortin Property does not have any mineral reserve estimation, as the work done 
on the Property to date has been of an "early exploratory" nature. 
 
 
18.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
The author of this report is not aware of any environment, permitting, legal, title, 
taxation, socio-political or any other issue that may materially affect the future 
exploration or mine development on the Fortin Property. 
 
 
19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The Fortin Property is located at the northwestern end of a northwest-trending 
deformation corridor in the eastern part of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. The 
deformation corridor is underlain by metamorphosed mafic volcanic flows and 
gabbroic intrusions that are overlain by metasedimentary rocks with greywacke, 
argillite and siltstone protoliths. These rocks have been locally intruded by ultramafic 
rocks (peridotite, dunite, pyroxenite and gabbro). The entire sequence has been 
compressed between vast tonalitic and granodioritic plutons that are locally highly 
metamorphosed to migmatitic gneisses.  
 
Interest in the Property is centred on two mineral showings: 1) the Ducros 
Pyroxenite showing, and; 2) the Ducros Gold showing (SIGEOM - 
http://sigeom.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/) 
 

Ducros Pyroxenite Showing: 
This is a copper-nickel-platinum-palladium (Cu-Ni-PGE) showing, hosted in an 
ultramafic sill-like intrusion, recently interpreted as a dunite. The dunite host 
rock is exposed at surface over 24 by 58 metres. A series of well-mineralized

Five (5) grab samples were collected in the Autumn of 2004 from the area of 
the Ducros Pyroxenite Showing as part of a Property due-diligence exercise. 
The best results was from Sample 116101, which yielded 0.67 g/t Au, 1.46 % 
Cu, 0.49% Ni, 0.86 g/t Pt, and 1.79 g/t Pd. The southern part of the exposed 
pyroxenite body was channel sampled in August 2007. The 5.08 m channel 
yielded 0.55 g/t Au, 1.30% Cu, 0.42% Ni, 0.75 g/t Pt, and 0.83 g/t Pd.  

 
Ducros Gold Showing: 
This showing is 75 metres to the northeast of the pyroxenite body, within a 
well-developed, northwest-striking, high-strain zone, exposed over 15 by 60 
metre area. The mineralized occurrence consists of wide, lenticular quartz 
veins, slightly oblique to the main foliation, with locally well-mineralized (pyrite 
± chalcopyrite) wall-rock contacts.  
 
Six (6) grab samples were collected in the Autumn of 2004 from the area of the 
gold showing as part of a Property due-diligence exercise.. The best result was 
4.0 g/t Au from sample 116110. Two (2) channels were cut across the gold 
showing in August of 2007 yielded slightly anomalous gold concentrations. The 
best result was 0.11 g/t Au over 0.39 m, from sample 116760.  
 

A seven (7) hole, 639 m diamond-drilling program, designed to follow up on the 
surface sampling results and to test IP anomalies, was completed in 2008. Hole GCF-
08-07, which undercut the pyroxenite showing, yielded the best results of 0.17g/t 
Au, 0.41% Cu, 0.35 % Ni, 0.23 g/t Pt, and 0.25 g/t Pd over 23.20 m (from 2.0 m to 
25.20 m down-hole). Other than a slightly anomalous section of 0.18% Ni, from 7.0 
to 14.0 m in Hole GCF-08-05, no other notable mineralization was encountered.  
 
The exploration programs carried out by Golden Valley were well thought out and 
conducted in a professional manner. Drilling was conducted by reputable contactors.  
The core was logged, split and sampled properly. The author is of the opinion that 
the analytical work performed by ALS-Chemex Laboratories was accurate and 
suitable for the Project. All samples were analyzed using appropriate assay 
procedures of the time. The drill logging and assay results were correctly compiled 
onto cross-sections. 
 
In the author's opinion, the work done on the Property to date has been adequate in 
demonstrating the presence of anomalous gold, copper, nickel and PGE 
mineralization on the Property. The gold-mineralized areas are represented by a 
continuous series of surface channel samples that adequately define the gold bearing 
host rock cut by the channels. The copper-, nickel- and PGE-mineralized areas are 
represented by a continuous series of drill core samples that adequately define the 
mineralized intervals cut by the drill holes. There was no attempt to define the 
overall length, width, depth or continuity of the mineralization on surface or 
underground. The data collected by Nunavik Nickel is consistent and reliable, and the 
author is not aware of any uncertainties related to these data.  
 
The author was commissioned by Nunavik Nickel to prepare a NI 43-101 compliant 
Technical Report on Exploration for the Fortin Property including a description and 
evaluation of historical exploration work. This objective has been met.  The historical 
data was found to be collected and documented by appropriate techniques and 
verified by modern standards.    
 



 Fortin Technical Report 35 
 

 

Based on the results from the 2004-2008 exploration work by Golden Valley Mines 
Ltd., which corroborated and expanded on known Cu-Ni-PGE and gold mineralization 
around the two Ducros showings, the new dunite-intrusion model established for the 
Ducros Pyroxenite showing, and the potential for additional mineralization along 
strike from these zones, further work is recommended on the Property. 
 
 
20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Based on the results from the 2004-07 exploration programs, the recognition of 
ultramafic (dunite) nature of the Fortin Sill, the known Cu-Ni-PGE and gold 
mineralization showings, and the untested induced polarization (IP) anomalies on the 
Property, the following further work is recommended on the Property:  
 

1. The area around the exposed parts of the Fortin sill (Ducros Pyroxenite 
showing) should be bulldozed (if necessary) and stripped;  

2. In order to classify and thereby better determine the mineralization model, 
the Fortin Sill should be investigated to determine its size, shape, thickness, 
layering (if any), texture (cumulate?, mesocumulate?, adcumulate?), the 
nature of its margins (poikilitic?, recrystallized?), grain size(s) (parent and 
margins), geometry within the local stratigraphy, and chemical composition 
(whole rock, MgO content of parent and margin, modal olivine); 

3. Detailed mapping, geophysical interpretation and, if necessary, diamond-
drilling should be employed to determine the extent of the Fortin Sill on the 
Property; 

4. Following its delineation, Pionjar, Winkie and diamond-drilling should be used 
to systematically sample the sill and its contact zone in the surrounding host 
rocks, over its entire extent. Emphasis should be placed on investigating the 
source of the IP conductors both within and at the margins of the ultramafic 
unit; 

5. The area around the gold occurrence should be bulldozed (if necessary) and 
stripped, and a detailed channel sampling of the exposed area instigated;  

6. Ground prospecting in conjunction with detailed, time-domain, ground 
geophysical surveys are recommended in order to help identify favourable 
areas for structurally controlled quartz vein-hosted gold mineralization along 
the shear zone that is exposed at the known occurrence. If warranted, follow-
up geological mapping, prospecting and diamond drilling should then be 
completed; 

7. Historic diamond-drilling by Brominco (1978) targeted a strong geophysical 
anomaly and coincident B-horizon soil anomaly in the northeastern part of the 
Property, intersected anomalous concentrations of Cu, Zn, Ni and Au. It is 
recommended that this area be re-investigated; 

8. At the moment no computerized database exists for the historical data 
completed on the Property. In order to better understand the geology, 
mineralization (type, form and distribution), alteration (type and distribution) 
and geometry (i.e., shape and size) of the mineralized features, it is strongly 
recommended that a comprehensive, digital, 3D geological model and 
database be assembled. The purpose of this work would be used to formulate 
a model on the geological and mineralizing controls for future drill-testing 
along the predicted sub-surface and along-strike locations of mineralization. 

 



 Fortin Technical Report 36 
 

 

The proposed exploration program would require a budget of $276,000. If results 
warrant, a Phase II $360,000 follow-up diamond-drilling program, utilizing large 
diameter coring, is recommended.
