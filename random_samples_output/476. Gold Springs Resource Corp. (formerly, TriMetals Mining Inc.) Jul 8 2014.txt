Gold Springs Project 
Trimetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 10 of 167 

1.0   SUMMARY 
The Gold Springs gold project ("Gold Springs" or "the Property") is an advanced exploration stage gold 
project located along the Nevada-Utah border in the U.S.  The project, located in western Iron County, 
Utah and eastern Lincoln County, Nevada, consists of 983 unpatented lode claims, 13 patented lode 
claims, and 4 State of Utah leases covering a total of approximately 7,568 ha.  The Gold Springs project is 
held by TriMetals Mining Inc. ("TMI" or "TriMetals") through Gold Springs LLC, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of High Desert Gold Corporation ("HDG"). Prior to March 17, 2014, TMI was known as South 
American Silver Corp., which acquired 100% ownership of HDG on December 20, 2013.  HDG is now a 
wholly owned subsidiary of TMI. All work completed on the property has been done by HDG unless 
otherwise noted.   

TMI contracted with Lane & Associates (L&A) to perform this Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA).  
This PEA for the Gold Springs Project is organized in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, 
including all 27 of the prescribed sections.  The purpose of this PEA is to provide an initial evaluation of 
the economic prospects for the Gold Springs project.  This evaluation will inform decisions to be made 
about the future of the project and what further work might be warranted.  The mining methods, 
estimated costs, and economic modeling presented in this PEA have not been presented previously.  
Sections 4 through 14 of the Updated Technical Report dated March 18, 2014 are repeated here for 
completeness and in fulfillment of NI 43-101 requirements. 

Gold mineralization at Gold Springs is hosted by complex sheeted veins, breccias and stockwork vein 
systems that are laterally extensive and locally form resistant ledges and ribs that protrude up to 10 
metres above the surrounding ground surface.  The veins contain quartz, adularia, and bladed calcite 
with minor sulfides (<2%) and represent a low sulfidation, epithermal gold-silver vein systems.  Trace 
element geochemistry for As (arsenic) and Sb (antimony) show relatively low values similar to other 
quartz-adularia epithermal vein systems such as the K-2 deposit  in Washington and the Midas deposit in 
northern Nevada.   

As indicated in the previously issued Resource Report (Kurt Katsura and Lane and Associates, March 18, 
2014), HDG completed a total of 19,233 metres of drilling in 141 holes. Of these holes 36 have been 
completed in the Jumbo resource area and 74 in the Grey Eagle resource area. In addition HDG 
completed 3 holes in the Midnight target, 3 holes in the Thor target, 1 hole in the North Jumbo target, 3 
holes in the Etna target, 3 holes in the Fluorite target, 6 holes in the State Section target, 3 holes in the 
Tin Can target and 2 holes in the Pope target. Previous work by other exploration companies saw the 
completion of drill holes in the Jumbo (18 drill holes), Etna (5 drill holes) and North Jennie (1 drill hole) 
targets. In each instance, the drilling demonstrated that gold mineralization is present in these areas. 
The combination of surface geochemical sampling and drilling results completed on the project to date 
shows the potential for significant gold mineralization in the Gold Springs project area as high-grade 
veins (>3.0 g/t gold) and areas of broad lower-grade disseminated and stockwork mineralization (<1.0 
g/t gold).  

In 2012, HDG completed an initial inferred resource on the Jumbo target area that estimated an inferred 
9,392,155 tonnes @ 0.57 g/t Au and 12.9 g/t Ag for a total of 173,115 troy ounces of gold and 3,880,745 
troy ounces of silver for a total of 233,344 troy ounces gold equivalent (AuEq) at a grade of 0.77 g/t 
(Gold equivalent (AuEq) calculations reflect gross metal content using the following metal prices of

$1,020/oz gold (Au), and $15.80/oz silver (Ag), and have not been adjusted for metallurgical recoveries) 
(Armitage, 2012).   

In 2013 the estimate was updated to an inferred resource within the Jumbo and Grey Eagle areas of 
19,373,085 tonnes @ 0.48 g/t Au and 10.4 g/t Ag for a total of 301,756 troy ounces of gold and 
6,476,149 troy ounces of silver. This equates to a gold equivalent (AuEq) grade of 0.67 g/t and a total of 
415,254 AuEq ounces (Gold equivalent (AuEq) calculations reflect gross metal content using the 
following metal prices of $1,600/oz gold (Au), and $28/oz silver (Ag), and have not been adjusted for 
metallurgical recoveries). 

In 2014, the resource was again updated by Kurt Katsura and Lane and Associates leading to the 
following resource. The Gold Springs Indicated  Geologic Model Mineral Resource is 21,289,000 tonnes 
@ 0.5 g/t Au and 9.8 g/t Ag for a contained 339,000 troy ounces gold and 6,687,000 troy ounces silver 
plus an Inferred Mineral Resource of 16,674,000 tonnes @ 0.4 g/t Au and 9.1 g/t Ag for an additional 
214,000 troy ounces gold and 4,857,000 troy ounces silver using a 0.2 g/t Au cutoff. This equates to an 
Indicated resource of 456,000 ounces AuEq averaging 0.67g/t AuEq and an additional 299,000 ounces 
AuEq @0.56 g/t AuEq in the Inferred category (Tables 14-4, 14-6 and 14-7). Gold equivalent (AuEq) 
calculations reflect gross metal content using the gold/silver ratio of 57.14, and have not been adjusted 
for metallurgical recoveries.  Readers are advised that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves 
do not have demonstrated economic viability under National Instrument 43-101. 

In April 2014, Lane and Associates were contracted to complete a PEA using the March 2014 updated 
mineral resource. To create the economic model for the PEA Lane and Associates first developed a 
series of pit shells within the mineral resource block model using a range of gold prices and associated 
cutoff grades for silver and gold, in order to establish the most profitable and robust mine plan. Mine 
schedules were developed for each of the resulting pit shells, using production rates appropriate to 
support an 8- to 10-year time frame for the project.  These results became the basis for estimating 
capital and operating costs and developing an economic model for the project.  Mining and process 
equipment were sized for each individual case.  The analysis assumed a heap leach process with a 
Merrill-Crowe plant to recover gold and silver.  The subsequent economic model used a base gold price 
of $1300/oz and a silver price of $21.00/oz.  

Pit shell 4, with a cutoff grade of 0.222, was chosen for this study because it had the most robust 
economics over a range of gold prices. Two scenarios are considered, owner-operated mining and 
contractor mining.  Under an owner-operated scenario, the capital costs are $85.6 million, with 
operating costs per tonne of leachable material of $7.58 per tonne.  A pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) 
at a 5% discount rate was $150.2 million and with a pre-tax Internal rate of return (IRR) of 39.66%.   

The Contractor Mining scenario showed improved economics for the project. Capital costs decreased by 
about 30% to $57.5 million because the contractor would supply the fleet of mining equipment.  Total 
operating costs per tonne of leachable material were about 7.5% higher for contractor mining at 
$8.16/tonne.  Pre-tax NPV at a discount rate of 5% for contractor mining was $162 million with an IRR of 
57.5%. 

Utah Corporate Income tax and Nevada Net Proceeds of Minerals tax, both 5%, and Federal Income tax 
of 25% were factored into the economic analysis.  Straight line depreciation of Capital Costs was also 
used in the economic analysis tax calculation.  The after tax NPV at a 5% discount rate and IRR for owner 
operated mining is $98 million and 29%; the after tax NPV at a 10% discount rate for owner operated 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 12 of 167 

mining is $62 million.  The after tax NPV at a 5% discount rate and with contractor mining is $109 million 
and the IRR is 42%; the after tax NPV at a 10% discount for contractor mining is $75 million.  
Approximately $68 million and $70 million are paid in State and Federal taxes in the owner-operated 
and contractor mining scenarios respectively. 

Additional analyses included a determination of pre-tax NPV sensitivity to gold price.  Contractor mining 
provided the highest NPVs and IRRs. 

This PEA is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too 
speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them 
to be categorized as mineral reserves under National Instrument 43-101.  Readers are advised that there 
is no certainty that the results projected in this preliminary economic assessment will be realized. 

Continued exploration work is recommended for the Gold Springs property, which would focus on 
collecting geologic information from detailed mapping, geochemical sampling of rock chips and analyzing 
the geophysical data, followed by a rotary drill program. The authors recommend drilling some core 
holes to add to the geologic understanding of the veins and related structures. These core holes should 
be used to gather specific gravity data. Future drill programs should continue to use standard and blank 
samples inserted into the drill samples submitted to the labs at a rate of no less than 5%. The primary 
focus of the recommended exploration program would be to continue to expand the gold resources at 
the Jumbo and Grey Eagle targets, convert inferred mineralization to Indicated category, as well as to 
define a third target.  All holes should be surveyed on completion. In addition, ongoing geological 
mapping, structural analyses, and geochemical sampling would focus on developing other target areas for 
drilling and expanding the current gold resources at Gold Springs.  The program should include 
metallurgical test work, topographic surveys, and base line environmental work. It is estimated that this 
continuing exploration and project development at the Gold Springs property would require an 
expenditure of approximately US$3,383,000 this year.

4.1  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 
The Gold Springs project includes 963 unpatented lode claims on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 
lands in Utah and Nevada, and on Stock Raising Homestead Lands in Nevada where private surface rights 
are underlain by Federal mineral rights. The mineral rights located under the homestead lands were 
staked under a Notice of Intent to Locate filed with the BLM Nevada state office. All claims were located 
with the use of a global positioning system ("GPS") and tied to section corners and quarter-section 
corners physically located in the field.  In addition to the unpatented lode claims, the HDG controls 13 
patented claims through lease or purchase agreements, two unpatented claims through an option to 
purchase agreement, and 4 Utah Trust Land leases for a total Property size of approximately 7,568 ha. 

The TMI project area falls within several historic mining districts that include the Deer Lodge, Fay, and the 
Eagle Valley district all within Nevada and the Gold Springs District in Utah.  For the purposes of this 
report the entire area is collectively referred to as the Gold Springs Mining District. The project area 
contains numerous historic mines which were active starting around 1897 and several mines that 
continued producing gold intermittently until the early 1940's. 

The Gold Springs project was formed by an Option and Earn-in Agreement dated January 10, 2010 which 
called for  HDG to expend $1 million in exploration and make payments to Pilot Gold Inc. ("PG" or "Pilot 
Gold") totaling $160,000. These obligations were completed and the two companies formed a 60% (HDG) 
and 40% (PG) joint venture on the project, which is held in Gold Springs LLC. Following the formation of 
the joint venture, Pilot Gold's interest was diluted through non-contribution to the continuing exploration 
programs. In 2013 HDG acquired PG's remaining interest and currently holds a 100% interest in the Gold 
Springs project. On December 20, 2013 TriMetals completed the acquisition of HDG to take control of 
100% of the Property.  

In addition to the federal lode claims which make up the bulk of the project there are three blocks of 
patented lode claims which have been acquired through leases or option agreements. These blocks are 
the Melville, Midnight, and the Talisman patents. These claim blocks represent an additional 82.68 ha 
which are part of the project and are shown in Figure 4-1. HDG has also completed leases on Utah Trust 
lands covering an additional 516 ha. HDG has also completed an option to purchase agreement on the 2 
Maxwell unpatented lode claims for an additional 18 ha bringing the total land position to approximately 
7,568 ha, as shown in Figure 4-2. 

The Melville and Midnight patented claim blocks are subject to a lease agreement dated March 19, 2010 
and provides for annual payments and a small retained Net Smelter Royalty (NSR). The Talisman patent is 
subject to an option agreement dated April 4, 2011 which calls for a series of payments in cash and HDG 
stock over a 4 year period to purchase a 100% interest in the property. The Maxwell unpatented claims 
are subject to an option to purchase with a small retained NSR. 

Two of the claims that were part of the original JV land package, the Grandee 2 and Grandee 4 are 
subject to an underlying lease option to purchase agreement dated June 11, 2009. This agreement 
requires annual advanced royalty payments and is subject to a small NSR. It also allows for the purchase 
of a 100% interest in the claims within the first 10 years of the agreement.

technical report.  Annual payments to the Bureau of Land management (BLM) are required to maintain 
the claims in good standing, and these are current through September 2014. 

5.0   ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1  ACCESS 
Access to the property is from Cedar City, west along State Route 56, to a point just west of the town of 
Modena, Utah, and then north via maintained gravel roads approximately 15 kilometres to the Property.  
Access is also available via County maintained gravel roads east from Pioche, Nevada through Eagle Valley 
and Ursine, Nevada.  Road access within the Property is served by a network of good gravel and dirt roads 
and trails that were previously developed to serve the mining and ranching activities in the area. 

5.2  CLIMATE 
Climate is typical for the southern Great Basin, with arid, relatively dry, cold winters with temperatures 
ranging from an average of 5oC in January to 9oC in February, and moderate summer temperatures that 
average 29.5oC in June to 33oC in July.  Rainfall falls relatively evenly throughout the year with slightly 
heavier periods during the summer monsoon season and from Pacific storm systems which generally last 
from July through early September and winter snow storms that occur between January and March, 
respectively.  Average annual precipitation is 260 millimetres ("mm"), as recorded at nearby Modena, 
Utah, located approximately 20 km southeast of the Property. 

5.3  LOCAL RESOURCES 
The Gold Springs property is located approximately ninety kilometres west of Cedar City, Utah and thirty 
five kilometres east of Pioche, Nevada, and approximately 15 kilometres (km) north of Utah State 
Highway 56/ Nevada Route 25, as shown in Figure 4-1.  Cedar City is the nearest significant town to the 
Property with a population of approximately 29,000. Cedar City lies along Interstate I-15 which provides 
access between Las Vegas, Nevada and Salt Lake City, Utah, and is served by the Union Pacific railroad 
and an airport with regular daily service to Salt Lake City.  Electric power lines and a spur of the Union 
Pacific railroad follow Utah State Highway 56, with the closest utility services at Modena, Utah.  There is a 
long history of mining in Iron County, Utah dating back to the 1860's and Cedar City has adequate 
facilities to provide labor and services to support the exploration and mining activities on the Property.  
Pioche, Nevada is located thirty five kilometres west of the property, and is the County seat for Lincoln 
County, Nevada.  Pioche has a population of approximately 2,000 and lies along US Highway 93 that links 
Caliente and Ely, Nevada and provides services to the local ranching communities.    

5.4  INFRASTRUCTURE 
Currently there is little infrastructure developed at the Gold Springs property other than a series of gravel 
and dirt roads and trails, a few local springs, wells, and tanks for watering livestock.  However, power 
lines and a spur railroad line follow Utah State Highway 56 approximately 15 kilometres south of the 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 23 of 167 

Property.  There has been adequate water available from springs and a well in the area to support the 
recent drilling operations at the project.  Cedar City is currently the closest source for an adequate labor 
force available for mining and development, transportation, and medical services. 

5.5  PHYSIOGRAPHY 
The Property has sufficient area in gently rolling topography and valleys available to accommodate the 
development of an open-pit, heap leach mining operation as described in this report.   

The Gold Springs property is located between Gold Springs Wash and the Deer Lodge Canyon along the 
southeastern flank of the Mahogany Mountains that straddle the Utah/Nevada state line.  The project 
covers gently rolling to moderate topography that ranges in elevation from 1,950 m (6400 feet) above sea 
level ("asl") at Newell Spring, to 2,337 m (7,668 feet) asl at Bull Mountain, and includes rolling hills and 
valleys as shown in Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2.  The topography is typical for the flanks of Basin and Range 
faulting, with colluvial cover blanketing the lower slopes of the fault-block range, which is subsequently 
being incised by more recent erosion.  The hills and slopes in the project area are covered by scrub 
Juniper and Pinyon pine, with sage brush and grasses dominating the valleys where they support grazing 
for cattle and wild horses.  Locally, areas have been stripped of vegetation (as shown in Figure 5-1) to 
support livestock grazing, which is currently the primary economic use of the land.

6.0   HISTORY 
The area surrounding the Gold Springs project has a long history of gold mining and exploration activity 
dating back to the 1870's when gold was first discovered by "Old Man Pike" who found high-grade float 
while prospecting in the area but was unable to trace it to its source (Perry, 1976).  In 1896 gold was 
discovered in the nearby Stateline District in Utah, and this "rush" attracted prospectors to the Gold 
Springs area (Tschanz and Pompeyan, 1970), with the first locations in the district made in 1897 on the 
Jumbo and Wild Irish claim groups (Salt Lake Mining Review, 1903).  The Gold Springs district was formed 
shortly thereafter (Tingley, 1998; Doelling and Tooker, 1983).  Originally, the portion of the mining district 
located in Utah was called the Gold Springs District, and the portion located in Nevada was called the 
Eagle Valley district and the Fay district (Perry, 1976), the use of several names for these mining areas has 
contributed to some of the confusion with regards to crediting past production records to various mining 
districts (Perry, 1976).  Mining continued in the Gold Springs area until the 1940's with the historical 
production reported as being 9,300 ounces of gold up to 1942, however, it is certain that this amount is 
well below what was actually produced, because some reports have combined mine production from the 
Gold Springs and the nearby Stateline District in Utah and some of the individual mine production records 
exceed what has been reported for the district (Perry, 1976).  Historic exploration and development of 
the mines was often reported to have been restricted by the inability of operators to establish significant 
land positions and control the laterally extensive vein systems along strike length.  In addition, some of 
the veins are cut and offset by post-mineral faults and the extensions never located, as is documented at 
the Jennie Mine.  The largest historic producing mines in the district are the Horseshoe, Jennie, and 
Homestake mines for which individual production records are generally lacking and inconsistent.  
Historically, the gold ores are reported to have been mined from high-grade veins and stockworks that 



Gold Springs Project

Page 25 of 167 

averaged >10 g/t gold across mining widths that locally exceeded 10 metres wide (Perry, 1976).  The ores 
typically had a low-sulfide content (<2%) and were treated in local mills which are reported to have 
recovered >80% of the gold by gravity separation and cyanide vat leaching methods (Short, 1909). 

In the 1960's-1970's, Ranchers Exploration, Inc. and others conducted drilling programs at the Horseshoe 
and Jumbo properties, with limited success in identifying significant gold resources there (Ranchers, 
1974).   In the early 1980's AMAX Exploration, Inc. looked at potential molybdenum mineralization in the 
nearby Stateline District in Utah (Candee, 1981), and there is evidence that FMC Exploration, Inc. may 
have also been interested in molybdenum mineralization in the Gold Springs caldera where they drilled 
several holes that target the rhyolitic breccias and rhyolite dome complex in the Bull Mountain area 
(Askey, 1985). 

Figure 6-1: Ore Bin at the Thor Mine 

 

In 1981, Energex Minerals Ltd. initiated consolidation of a significant land position that included the 
Jumbo and Etna target areas, and in 1988 completed a 10-hole, 890 metre reverse circulation drilling 
program that focused on identifying bulk-mineable gold mineralization targets.  Some of the Energex 
Minerals drilling data reported mineralized drill intercepts in the Jumbo target grading 2.0 g/t gold across 
24.4 metres, and 14.5 g/t gold across 1.5 metres (Energex News Release, 9/1988).  Between 1985 and 
1988, Energex completed 12 drill holes in the Jumbo, Etna and Thor target areas, however, this data was 
not available to the Authors for review. During 1996-1998 Cambior Inc. ("Cambior"), acquired a large land 
position in the area and conducted a program of geological mapping, rock chip, and soil sampling.  
Cambior collected and analyzed 662 rock chip samples across the project area, and 88 soil samples.  In 
1998, the property was optioned to Phelps Dodge Exploration, Inc.  ("Phelps Dodge") who evaluated the 
property, and focused their efforts on gold mineralization hosted in the caldera environment, and in 
potential bulk tonnage targets in the Jumbo and Etna areas.  Phelps Dodge allowed the claims to lapse in 
2001.  North American Gold Inc. re-staked and acquired claims in the area during 2002-2003, conducted 
geochemical sampling, and completed the drilling of six reverse circulation holes in the Jumbo and Etna 
target areas.  In 2004, Amanda Resources Corporation ("Amanda Resources") acquired the property from 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 26 of 167 

North American Gold Inc., and conducted exploration on a portion of the current property controlled by 
HDG.  The work conducted by Amanda Resources included geologic mapping and sampling in the Etna, 
Jumbo and Iris areas, and geophysical work consisting of magnetometer and Controlled Source Audio 
Magneto Tellurics (CSAMT) surveys on portions of the property conducted by Zonge Geosciences of Reno, 
Nevada.  In 2005 Amanda Resources changed its name to Astral Mining Corporation and filed a NI 43-101 
report on their work to that date.  Astral completed a 10 hole reverse circulation drilling program in 2006 
on the Jumbo, Etna, and North Jennie targets, and in 2009 Astral terminated their interest in the project 
due to a lack of funds.  

In 1985 and 1988, Energex completed a 12 holes RC drilling program totaling 935.9 metres (3,070.5 feet). 
Eight holes were completed in the Jumbo Zone (Grandee #2 and Grandee #4 claims), two holes in the 
Etna Zone (Etna #1 and Etna #2 claims), and two in the Thor Zone. The bulk of the Energex data was 
made available through the 1985 Summary Report of the Gold Springs Property (Deering et al., 1985), 
and the Astral Mining Technical Report of the Gold Springs District (Smith, 2005).  

The following tables (Table 6-1 and Table 6-2) summarize the drilling conducted by Energex:

North American Gold drilled six reverse circulation holes on the property in the fall of 2003 (Table 6-3): 
three holes on the Etna Zone and three holes in the southern portion of the Jumbo Zone. HDG does not 
have copies of the North American Gold drilling data but results were reported in the Technical Report on 
the Gold Springs District (Smith, 2005).

In 2006, Astral completed 10 holes for a total of 1,756.6 metres of reverse-circulation drilling (Table 6-4). 
Eight holes were located on the Jumbo target, one on the Etna and one on the North Jennie. The North 
Jennie hole was targeted on a CSAMT resistivity anomaly in an area of post mineral cover. The Astral drill 
logs were available for review and assays were compiled in electronic data bases. The drill program was 
completed by Harris Drilling out of Elko, Nevada.

7.0   GEOLOGIC SETTING AND 
MINERALIZATION 

7.1  REGIONAL OVERVIEW 
The project is situated in the southeastern portion of the Basin and Range physiographic province which 
is characterized by northerly-trending mountain ranges with, closed internal drainage basins that resulted 
from extensional tectonism and associated volcanism during the Tertiary period.  The Gold Springs 
project lies within the Indian Peak volcanic field, which is a broad Tertiary volcanic field that straddles the 
Utah-Nevada border and contains several nested, collapsed calderas, and resurgent dome features that 
formed as part of a major Oligocene-Miocene "ignimbrite flare-up cycle" (Best, et al., 1989). The Indian 
Peak caldera complex is the southeastern extension of the Central Nevada volcanic complex and 
represents a ten million year period of focused magmatic and volcanic activity (Best, et al., 1989).  The 
initial volcanic field formed about 32 to 27 million years ago (Ma) in the southeastern Great Basin and 
consists of the Indian Peak caldera complex and the surrounding blanket of calc-alkaline ash-flow tuff 
sheets that cover an area of approximately 55,000 square kilometres, and with an estimated volume of 
approximately 10,000 cubic kilometres of volcanic rocks. The caldera complex is located central to the 
volcanic field, and the volume of rock is dominated by ash-flow tuff units, with minor amounts of 
andesite and rhyolite flows that were extruded during the early stages and again later in the life of the 
volcanic complex (Best et al., 1989).  Subsequent dome building resurgence and associated felsic 
volcanism (25-19 ma) and hydrothermal mineralization was related to the Buck Mountain-Gold Springs 
rhyolite dome-caldera-diatreme event between 19 to 16.5 ma (Williams et al, 1997).  Younger volcanic 
activity in the project area consists of felsic flows and tuffs dated between 16 to 10 million years ago 
(Williams et al., 1997). 

The oldest rocks in the region consist of Proterozoic through lower Mesozoic sedimentary sequence that 
became folded and thrust-faulted eastward during the Cretaceous Sevier orogeny, and were 
subsequently overlain by Tertiary sedimentary deposits (Stewart, 1980).  Regional crustal extension 
during the middle Cenozoic resulted in crustal thinning, widespread volcanic activity throughout the 
Central Nevada volcanic field, including the Indian Peak volcanic field, and extending eastward to the 
Marysville volcanic complex that was active until 10 ma.  The basin and range faulting overprints the

Indian Peak caldera complex and nearly half of the complex now lies beneath alluvium-filled basins or 
younger volcanic rocks (Best et al., 1989a). 

Andesite and latite flows formed during the early and late stages in the evolution of the Indian Peak 
volcanic complex.  The early andesite flows have previously been correlated with the Escalante Desert 
Formation, approximately 32 Ma (Best et al., 1989a), however new data suggests that the older andesite-
latite sequence is more closely related to the Condor Canyon Fm. (22-23 ma) (Williams et al., 1997; 
Rowley et al., 2008).  This thick section (300 m) of intermediate volcanic tuffs and flows are overlain by a 
series of rhyolitic to dacitic flows and tuffs associated with episodic eruptions from the caldera complex 
which are correlated with the Blawn Formation.  This stage of volcanic activity includes the development 
of collapse caldera features and resurgent domes and ash eruptions that were deposited over an 
extensive area (Best et al., 1992).  The Gold Springs caldera was formed during this period of activity, and 
is a prominent feature in the TMI project area. 

Following a hiatus of approximately 3 million years after final eruptions in the Indian Peak complex, the 
Caliente caldera complex began activity 40 km to the south of the project area, as part of the continued 
southward migration of volcanism (Rowley and Sider, 1988; Best et al., 1989a).  During the Pliocene, local 
basins and lakes formed as a result of Basin and Range faulting and these features accumulated 
sediments and ash deposits that overlie the older volcanic rock units.  Uplift has continued into the 
Quaternary and many of the slopes are covered with a variable thickness of recent colluvial and alluvial 
deposits. 

Gold mineralization in the Gold Springs project is hosted by complex sheeted veins, breccias, and 
stockworks that are oriented along NE- and NW-striking structural zones that cut andesite and latite 
flows, and rhyolite dikes around the collapsed margins of the Gold Springs caldera.  The veins typically 
form resistant ledges and ribs that protrude up to 10 metres above the surrounding ground surface and 
consist of quartz, adularia, and calcite with minor sulfides (<2%).  These vein systems are laterally 
extensive and can be traced for up to two kilometres along strike between exposures where the veins are 
not obscured by the Quaternary cover.  Numerous small mines and prospects, primarily exploiting high-
grade gold and silver veins, are scattered throughout the volcanic field and have remained largely inactive 
since the 1940's (Perry, 1976; Thompson and Perry, 1976). 

7.2  LOCAL GEOLOGIC SETTING 
In general, the project area extends along the flanks of the Mahogany Mountains, and most of the area is 
covered by post-mineral felsic tuffs and flows and by Quaternary colluvial deposits that are related to 
recent basin range faulting and erosion. 

The oldest rocks near the project area are Upper Cambrian light to dark gray limestone and dolomites 
that are correlated with the Mendha Formation (Tschanz and Pompeyan, 1970) which have been mapped 
by Best et al. (1992) several kilometres northwest of the project area and  may represent a piece of 
basement exposed along the margins of the Indian Springs caldera. The Paleozoic rocks have not been 
found at the surface or in drilling within the project area.  

The following is a summary of the rock units in the central Indian Peak volcanic complex near the project 
area, as they have been described and subdivided by Williams et al. (1997) and in Utah by Rowley et al. 
(2008), and are shown in Figure 7-1 below.  The correlation among individual rock units within a volcanic 
field is inherently a complex matter, because individual eruptive events, flows, and units are generally 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 30 of 167 

not laterally extensive and temporal sequences are tenuous at best.  In the Gold Springs project area, 
recent mapping by Rowley et al. (2008) was conducted in the Utah portion of the project area, and some 
of these maps units attempt to further refine the volcanic stratigraphy described by Williams et al. 
(1997).  The following discussion of the geology is a comprehensive summary that incorporates a 
combination of this data. The rock units are described below from the oldest to youngest. 

Andesite to latite lava flows and tuffs (Oligocene-Miocene 23-22 ma)) are prevalent in the project area 
(Tlf), and may be correlated with the Condor Canyon trachydacite at 22.8 ma or possibly part of the 
Blawn Formation mafic flows (Rowley et al., 2008).  The andesite-latite flows are of variable thicknesses, 
and incomplete sections are as much as 300 metres thick (Rowley et al., 2008). The andesite section is 
predominat in the Buck Mountain to Grey Eagle area and is composed of a series of andesite flows, lithic 
tuff breccias and biotite tuffs and are the primary host rock for gold-silver mineralization at Jennie, Thor, 
Snowflake, Homestake and Grey Eagle mine areas. The older latite flows and tuffs appear to overlie the 
andesite section and are often only distinguishable from the andesites by having an increase in biotite 
content. The latite flows are the primary host rock for the vein systems that are exposed in the Jumbo, 
State Section and portions of the Etna mine areas. 

There are Younger Latite Lava Flows (Miocene) which form  a sequence of reddish-brown lava flows that 
contain sparse phenocrysts of plagioclase, biotite, and clinopyroxene and magnetite, tentatively 
correlated with the Intermediate flows of Serviceberry Creek (Tscl), and are probably as much as several 
hundred metres thick in the Jumbo-Etna area (Best et al., 1992). The Younger Latite flows and tuffs are 
mostly post-mineral and are observed to cover mineralized sections in the older andesite and latite flows.  
Locally the younger latite flows have a dark grey basal vitrophyre where the lower contact has been 
observed (Rowley et al., 2008). 

Condor Canyon Formation (Miocene) consists of the Bauers Tuff Member and the underlying Swett Tuff 
Member, each consists of a simple cooling unit of densely welded rhyolite ash-flow tuff that typically 
contain less than 20% phenocrysts, and characterized by an upper devitrified portion containing lapilli 
and small blocks of pumice, and a lower black vitrophyre just above the base of the units (Best et al., 
1992).  These units are tentatively correlated with the Blawn Formation described below. 

Blawn Formation (Miocene) is an assemblage of siliceous rhyolite and trachyandesitic rocks of early 
Miocene age that have been subdivided into informal members of rhyolite tuffs (Tbg), rhyolite lava flows 
(Tsr), rhyolite intrusions (Tbi), breccias (Tbb), mafic lava flows, and minor epiclastic deposits (Tt).  The age 
for the rhyolite flows range from 24 to 18 Ma (Best et al., 1992).   The andesite-latite sequence, described 
above, could be related to the more mafic members of the Blawn Formation.  Portions of the upper 
Blawn Formation have been correlated with the older rhyolite member (Trdo) of the Isom Formation, as 
described by Rowley et al. (2008), in Utah.

Page 32 of 167 

The Isom Formation (Oligocene 22-18 ma)) consists of as many as three moderately to densely welded 
units of trachytic ash-flow tuff (Rowley et al., 1991 and Rowley et al., 2008).  In the Utah portion of the 
property, the low-silica rhyolites described by Rowley et al. (2008) as Trdo (older rhyolites) probably 
represent the terminal phase of calc-alkaline volcanism related to an ignimbrite episode.  Subsequent 
volcanism in the project area shows a trend towards increasingly alkaline flows and tuffs.  An upper unit 
locally contains a black vitrophyre, several lower members have been identified that exhibit reddish 
cooling units and may be intercalated with tuffs from other sources (Best et al., 1989b).  This package of 
flows and tuffs is observed to be magnetite-bearing in the State section-Etna areas of the project, and it is 
the main host unit for gold vein mineralization in the State Line District.  This unit is shown as Tbr in 
Figure 7-1. 

Perhaps the most striking geologic feature in the project area is the collapsed Gold Springs caldera, 
mapped by United States Geological Survey (the "USGS") (Best, et al., 1992), in the vicinity of Bull 
Mountain. This caldera is bound on the west and northwest by heterolithic breccias along a steeply-
dipping contact with older andesite flows, and interior to the caldera is a resurgent rhyolite dome 
complex at Bull Mountain and intercalated tuffaceous sediments, tuffs, and flows that are 20-16.5 ma 
(Rowley et al., 2008).  In the Pope and Charlie Ross Mine areas, the tuffs appear to have breached the 
caldera margin and uncomformably overlie the surrounding andesite flows, extending southward 
towards the Jennie Mine. 

Pliocene-Miocene (16-10 ma) clastics rock units (Tt) consist of a heterogenous sequence of weakly 
consolidated primary pyroclastic flows, reworked pyroclastic material, conglomerates and epiclastic rocks 
that underlie the Steamboat Mountain Formation (Best et al., 1992).  This unit generally represents the 
erosional unconformity that occurred during and after the major felsic tuff eruptive cycle from the 
caldera complex.   These sedimentary rock units were deposited in basins that formed during Basin and 
Range extensional faulting and subsidence of the Pine Park and Telegraph Draw calderas.  These poorly 
consolidated volcanoclastic and epiclastic units cover broad areas of prospective older andesite and 
latite.  The basal unconformity and pre-depositional topography is being evaluated as potential target 
areas for mineralization in the exploration programs for the Grey Eagle, Jumbo and Midnight areas. 

Steamboat Mountain Formation (Miocene) is a bi-modal assemblage of high-silica rhyolite and basaltic 
trachyandesite of middle Miocene age (Best et al., 1987). In the project area the Steamboat Mountain 
rhyolite flow unit is found capping some of the ridges between Deer Lodge Canyon and the Jumbo area. 

Lacustrine Deposits (Upper Miocene to Pliocene) consist of silt and fine sand sediments (Tal) that 
accumulated in a lake that occupied ancestral Eagle Valley, to the west of the project area.  These 
sediments are generally fine-grained and grade laterally and upwards into coarse sands and gravels, 
representing a transition from lacustrine to alluvial deposition as the basin filled and along its eastern 
margins.  Intercalated with the lacustrine sediments are at least two tephra units that have been 
identified, of which one bears similarity to the Point of Rocks tuff near Lathrop Wells in southwestern 
Nevada (Best et al., 1992). Basin-fill sediments consisting of poorly to moderately consolidated material in 
formed during caldera subsidence and development of younger Basin and Range faulting during the 
Pliocene to Quaternary (Rowley et al., 2008). 

Quaternary Deposits consist of a number of distinguishable and mappable units that represent tectonic 
episodes and subsequent erosion and deposition along the basin and range front.  These include talus 
(debris trains), colluvial deposits (Qc), alluvial deposits adjacent to streams (Qal), floodplain deposits in 
the modern washes, and older benches and terraces associated with progressive down cutting of fan and

pediment alluvium.  Perhaps the most important note here is that a majority of the project area is 
covered by Quaternary deposits of varying thickness.  Of particular interest is the presence of high-grade 
vein material as cobbles and boulders that occur in these deposits.  Many shafts and cuts were developed 
historically in the colluvium based on the presence of ore-grade material, and it is unclear how far this 
material has travelled from its source. 

7.3  PROJECT LITHOLOGIC UNITS 
The TMI Gold Springs project is located in the southern portion of the Indian Peak volcanic field, 
surrounding and including the Gold Springs caldera.  The project area includes many of the litholigic units 
that are described above, or portions of those units.  In general the gold-silver mineralization is found in a 
variety of northwest to northeast striking quartz-adularia +/- calcite veins, stockworks, hydrothermal 
breccias and silicified structural zones which are predominantly hosted in older (23-22 ma) andesite and 
latite flows and tuffs around the margins of the Gold Springs (19-16.5 ma) caldera/diatreme.  Locally the 
Gold Springs rhyolite and welded to non-welded tuff breccias are also mineralized.  The following 
lithologic descriptions summarize those found in the project areas. 

The older andesites (Tlf) are a composite of many flows, tuffs and multilithic tuff breccias with a variable 
aggregate thickness of as much as 100 metres (Best et al., 1992), and there has been some attempt to 
identify individual flow units (Smith, 2005).  The andesite flows are the primary host rock for the vein 
systems that have been historically mined in the Gold Springs project area (Perry, 1976), and are the 
primary host rocks for Grey Eagle, Homestake, Horseshoe, Snowflake, Jennie, Thor, Midnight and 
portions of the Jumbo and Etna mine mineralization.  Post-mineral andesite dikes are found in the Grey 
Eagle area and locally cut out mineralization in the Iris mine area. TMI is currently working to develop a 
better understanding of this important host rock unit, particularly where subdividing this package and 
identifying individual flows or units may have a bearing for preferentially hosting the high grade vein and 
stockwork mineralization. 

The older latite flows and tuffs (Tlf) are prevalent in the Jumbo-State Section-Etna areas and appear to 
conformably overlie and are possibly intercalated with the andesite flows observed in the South Jumbo 
area.  Differentiating between the latite and andesite flows is difficult, however, the latite can generally 
be identified based on increased biotite content, magnetite and rare quartz phenocrysts.  The ridge tops 
surrounding the Jumbo area are often capped by thin, platy, biotite-latite flows that are typically light 
grey in color, exhibit moderate sericitic (illite) alteration, and are weakly veined.  These platy latites 
possibly formed a cap to the mineralizing fluids that locally created hydrothermal "ponding" at the base 
of the flows.  

A sequence of synpost mineral latite flows overlie the mineralized andesite and latite flows in the State 
Section and Etna mine area.  The younger latite flows are weakly porphyritic, magnetite-bearing, and 
locally exhibit an aphanitc matrix.  The base of the flows are locally altered but in several locations north 
of Etna, the fresh flows overlie strongly stockworked, altered and mineralized latite and andesite.  
Detailed surface mapping and sampling is planned during 2014 to better understand the relationship 
between these flows and the underlying mineralized targets in the area.

A series of three moderately to densely welded units of trachytic ash-flow tuffs of the Isom Formation 
unconformably overlie the andesite flows (Rowley et al., 1991), these units are referred to as the old 
rhyolite (Trdo) in the recent mapping in Utah (Rowley et al., 2008) and is the host for most of the 
mineralization in the State Line District to the north of the TMI project.  Remnants of an upper unit locally 
contains a black vitrophyre, and several lower members have been identified that exhibit reddish cooling 
units and may be intercalated with tuffs from other sources found to the east of the Jumbo mine area, 
and cap some of the higher ridges and hills in the project area. Locally, in the project area, there are 
zones with late stage deuteric alteration observed that appear as orange frothy tuffs zones but no 
significant mineralization has been found within the old rhyolites east of Jumbo target area. 

An assemblage of siliceous rhyolite and trachyandesitic rocks of early Miocene age, have been subdivided 
into informal members of rhyolite, tuffs, rhyolite lava flows, rhyolite intrusions, mafic lava flows, and 
minor epiclastic deposits correlated with the Blawn Formation, occur in the Bull Mountain area, and 
extend southward to the Pope Mine area where they unconformably overlie the older andesite flows  
These rocks are particularly useful in mapping and understanding the features that define the caldera 
margins, domes, flows and epiclastic debris associated with this period of volcanic activity, which range 
from 24 to 18 Ma (Best et al., 1992).  

The Gold Springs caldera is a prominent feature in the project area, and was identified by the USGS (Best, 
et al., 1992), in the vicinity of Bull Mountain. The caldera is partially defined on the west and northwest 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 35 of 167 

by outcrops of heterolithic breccias that locally form large ribs along the steeply-dipping contact with 
older andesite flows to the south and west caldera margin, and contain a resurgent rhyolite dome 
complex.  Rhyolitic flows and intercalated tuffaceous sediments and tuffs occur within the caldera and 
extend beyond the margins in the Pope and Charlie Ross Mine areas, where they unconformably overlie 
the surrounding andesite flows, and extend southward towards the Jennie Mine and host gold 
mineralization. The Gold Springs Caldera appears to be the geographic focus of the districts gold-silver 
mineralization as well as hosting fluorite-moly mineralization. Throughout the Gold Springs district, 
poorly consolidated felsic tuffs, reworked epiclastics and lacustrine deposits, and tuffaceous sediments 
accumulated in the ancestral Eagle Valley during the Miocene-Pliocene and are observed to 
unconformably overlie the mineralized andesite flows.  The lacustrine sedimentary units grade laterally 
into agglomerates and poorly sorted sediments that are weakly consolidated, and are often 
indistinguishable from the younger Quaternary sediments.  Locally present are vitrophyres, obsidian-
bearing tephra units, and tuffaceous sedimentary units that are intercalated with the coarse sands and 
gravels, some of these have been tentatively correlated with the Point of Rocks tuff near Lathrop Wells in 
southwestern Nevada (Best et al., 1992). 

The USGS (Best et al., 1992) has identified a number of distinct mappable Quaternary deposits in the 
project area that represent a series of tectonic episodes and subsequent erosion and deposition along 
the range front. The Basin filling sediments (Ts) help define the limits of extensional depressions that 
formed during the Miocene Basin and Range extension and during local caldera subsidence (Rowley et al., 
2008)  The most pronounced basin in the area is a broad, W-NW trending basin that corresponds to 
Prohibition Flats area on the western portion of the project. The clastic units include talus (debris trains), 
colluvial deposits, alluvial deposits adjacent to streams, floodplain deposits in the modern washes, and 
older benches and terraces associated with progressive down cutting of fan and pediment alluvium.  A 
majority of the project area is covered beneath these Quaternary deposits, which are of varying 
thickness, and it is interesting to note that the vast majority of areas where the bedrock andesites are 
exposed are also where gold mineralization has been prospected and mined.  Of particular interest is the 
presence of high-grade vein material as cobbles and boulders that occur in some of the Quaternary 
deposits, historically, this is what initially attracted the first wave of prospecting in the 1870's, but the 
source for the ore material remained elusive to the early prospectors (Perry, 1976).  There are a number 
of shafts and open cuts throughout the project area that appear to have been developed in colluvium 
searching for the presence of ore-grade material.  In some cases, it appears that this material may not 
have travelled far from the source, and there is a possibility that these areas may be a relic of the large 
outcropping vein ribs, as seen in the Jumbo target area and as observed in trenches and by drilling in the 
Grey Eagle area.  The significance of these local basin filling tuffs became evident during the 2013 Grey 
Eagle exploration drilling, where the main northeast-striking, westerly dipping South Grey Eagle 
stockwork zone was traced under post-mineral clastic cover for over 400 metres to the south.  Local post-
mineral, normal faulting created moderate changes (3-50 m) in the thickness of the overlying clastic 
package (Ts) where it thickens  downslope to the southwest and HDG step-out drilling intercepted >200 
metres of overlying tuff.  Drilling indicates that the basal tuff zones incorporated variable thicknesses (1-8 
m) of mineralized vein-bearing regolith deposited in a high energy environment on moderate to steep 
topography.  Resistant ridges of quartz veining are locally surrounded and covered by post-mineral 
clastics which indicate a minimum of 20 metres of relief.  In the South Jumbo area, several holes hit 20 
metre thicknesses of post-mineral tuff which overlies a weathered, chalcedony-bearing andesite which 
may be the top of an erosional surface.  Detailed mapping of the tuff basins and understanding their

relationship to mineralization will enhance 2014 drilling performance in projecting mineralized zones 
beneath cover.

7.4  STRUCTURE 
The Gold Springs project area is located within the Basin and Range physiographic province and is 
characterized by N-S block faulting that produced internally draining basins and ranges that have 
developed since the early Pliocene (Best et al., 1992).  The original rock units in the Indian Peak volcanic 
field have been displaced by faulting, and a majority of the project area remains covered beneath 
younger Pliocene to Quaternary sediments and colluvium.   

The dominant mineralized structures in the Gold Springs project generally strike NS to NE/NW and are 
moderately to steeply-dipping along laterally extensive fault zones that cut the andesites, and are shown 
in Figure 7-2.  In addition there are subsidiary NE-striking veins systems such as in the Etna and Midnight 
areas, and in some cases these NE-striking zones contain a series of NW-striking veins within them.  At 
the Jumbo target, the vein system consists of a wide region of silicification, veining, alteration, and clast 
and matrix-supported breccias, with predominate sets of N-NE or SW striking veins and numerous minor 
sets of varying orientations.  TMI is conducting more detailed analysis to determine if there are additional 
structural controls on the high grade gold mineralization.  At many of the historic mine sites, it has been 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 37 of 167 

observed and reported that only the vein portions grading >0.2 oz/t gold were mined (Perry, 1976) and 
the remaining vein material was left behind.   

Post-mineral faults have been observed and reported by previous workers (mostly from inaccessible 
underground mine workings).  Several faults displace or are oriented parallel to the mineralized veins 
with the predominate faults striking E, NE, and N/S.  Some workers have speculated that the N-S faults 
reflect re-activation along basement structures in the pre-Tertiary rocks (Perry, 1976).  In the Jennie 
Mine, the main vein was cut off above the 300 foot level by a series of N-S faults dipping to the west, and 
a fault striking N80E, dipping 55o south displaced the Jennie vein to the north of the main shaft (Mallory, 
1928).  The Thor vein is also cut off on the north and south by post-mineral faulting.  It is possible that the 
northern fault may be the same series of faults that offsets the Jennie vein.  In the Etna area, the main 
vein has been noted to strike N80oW, and dips west consisting of a series of stringers and veins. The Etna 
vein has been cut by a post-mineral fault that has displaced the vein and dips downward to the east. 

There are several areas where the N-S vein structures appear to intersect the margins of the Gold Springs 
Caldera (Figure 7-2) in the vicinity of the Pope and Charlie Ross mines, these areas exhibit stockwork 
veining and pervasive alteration (hematite, jarosite and goethite staining) in the tuff units.  The Pope vein 
strikes N60-65oE, and is nearly vertical and cuts welded crystal tuffs, the Charlie Ross vein strikes N30oE 
and dips 72o south and is associated with sericitic alteration and some quartz veining.   

7.5  MINERALIZATION 
Mineralization in the Gold Springs area is characterized by dominant, generally north-striking faults and 
structures that are the primary control for the low sulfidation-type gold bearing quartz veins, with 
subsidiary northeast and northwest striking gold bearing veins also noted in the target areas.  Andesite 
and latite flows are the primary host rocks to the gold-silver mineralization in the district and were 
intercepted during drilling at the Jumbo, Thor, Midnight, Grey Eagle, and Homestead target areas 
conducted by HDG.  

In general, the gold mineralization in the Gold Springs area consists of structurally controlled quartz-
adularia +/-calcite veins, hydrothermal breccias, and associated stockwork veins, in addition to broad 
areas of disseminated mineralization in the footwall of the Jumbo structural zone. These types of 
mineralization are primarily hosted in andesite and latite flows that surround the collapsed Gold Springs 
Caldera. Host rocks adjacent to the veins and stockwork zones are variably silicified, and exhibit sericitic 
(illite), argillic and propylitic alteration in a general progression away from the vein. Mineralization also 
occurs in the Gold Springs rhyolite ash-flow tuff that locally overlies the andesites, and here the veins are 
commonly narrow surrounded by stockworks, and exhibit broad areas of sericitic (illite) alteration 
associated with the presence of fluorite.  Down-hole assay and surface trench data demonstrate broad 
areas of gold/silver mineralization that shows a disseminated or widespread stockwork style surrounding 
the vein mineralization. These broad areas of mineralization typically contain AuEq values of equal or 
greater than 0.20 g/t, and constitute a majority of the total gold mineralization at Gold Springs. 

The dominant orientation for veins in the District is north-northwest to north-northeast with variable 
steep dips to the east and west. Individual veins may be segmented, and more or less occur in a regional 
belt or zones of mineralization that trends northwest to southeast.  There is a distinct difference 
observed in the styles of mineralization between the Jumbo zone and the Grey Eagle zone, as describe 
below. 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 38 of 167 

The Jumbo-Sharks Mouth (S. Jumbo)-State Section-Etna zone (referred to generally as the Jumbo Trend)  
is defined as a prominent N-S striking structural zone that was broadly-effected by an early pyrite-argillic 
alteration possibly related to an intermediate sulfidation phase of alteration associated with calc-alkalic 
andesitic volcanism (23-22 ma).  The argillic alteration may have created increased porosity within the 
structural zone and allowed for younger low-sulfidation fluids to permeate during the younger Gold 
Springs caldera event.  These younger alkaline fluids deposited the quartz-adularia, +/-calcite veins into 
fractures, faults and hydrothermal breccia zones.  The early acidic fluids created an inner pyrite-clay 
alteration that appears zoned outward into chlorite-epidote stable propylitic alteration.  The younger 
potassium-rich fluids created an inner zone of quartz-sericite (illite)-pyrite-QSP alteration which appears 
to have zoned outwards into a blue-green K- smectite (celadonite) zone that locally overprints the 
pervasive propylitic alteration. Gold-silver mineralization is typically the strongest within the main vein-
structural zone, particularly proximal to the pebble breccia zones.  The pebble breccias occur within pipe-
like hydrothermal breccias within the veins where rounded to sub-rounded individual clasts of country 
rock are coated by a rim of acicular quartz crystals in a siliceous-quartz crystal matrix.  In the Jumbo zone, 
significant mineralization is associated with siliceous micro-breccias and hairline silica fractures which 
may indicate significant over-pressuring of the hydrothermal system and fluid being released during 
hydrofracture events. These structural zones  formed areas of increased permeability well away from the 
main ore bearing conduits, and host gold mineralization in the stockworks, breccias, and disseminated 
portions of the defined resources described in this report. 

Figure 7-4: View of pebble Breccia in the Main Jumbo Vein Zone 

 
Note rounded clasts rimmed by quartz, many of the breccia clasts exhibit cross cutting relations from 
earlier vein episodes 
 

The Grey Eagle and Homestead zones are characterized by the widespread hematitic "red" alteration in 
the surrounding andesites and large areas of scattered quartz veins and stockworks.  The andesite and 
latite exposures between Deer Lodge Canyon and Grey Eagle Canyon have been altered by low-
sulfidation alkaline fluids which were biotite-hornblende stable and probably produced widespread 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 39 of 167 

disseminated adularia. The fluids weakly altered the plagioclase which produced excess CaCo3 and 
altered the magnetite to hematite.  This alteration assemblage is typical of alkaline porphyry systems in 
the Northern Cordillera.  The main vein systems in the Grey Eagle area are strong northwest to northeast 
striking zones, steeply dipping, and crosscut a sequence of red andesite-latite flows which host 15-100 
metre thick zones of sheeted and stockwork quartz-adularia-calcite veins.  The northern portion of the 
Grey Eagle zone is a NNE striking, westerly dipping structural zone with a 20-100 metre thick quartz-
adularia-calcite vein-stockwork which forms a 500 metre-long resistant ridge flanked by overlying tuffs.  
In general, the Grey Eagle zone appears to be a structurally shattered zone between an upper and lower 
bounding fault structure. This structural preparation created a broad conduit for ore bearing fluids to 
migrate through, resulting in an overlapping sequence of quartz-calcite veins, quartz veins and stockwork 
zones which constitute the Grey Eagle resource area described in this report. The 2013 drill program 
extended the Grey Eagle zone an additional 400 metres to the south where it lies beneath post-mineral 
tuff and epiclastic material. The mineralized zone was intercepted in the 2013 drill program where the 
post-mineral cover appears to thicken towards the southwest. The Grey Eagle vein zone contains 
abundant calcite veining and the gold mineralization is typically associated with 5-10% calcite.   

Within the vein zones, quartz is generally coarse-grained crystalline and appears in crustiform, colloform 
banding, comb, and pseudomorphs of bladed carbonate forms. The quartz veins are generally white to 
light grey and greenish in color. Multiple episodes of veining are evident from the replacement textures 
and the different varieties of vein material being cut by subsequent veins.  

Sulphides are uncommon in the veins, and generally constitute <1% of the veins, but when seen they 
occur as pyrite and lesser amounts of arsenopyrite, predominantly in the Jumbo-Etna area. Pyrite is 
observed disseminated throughout lateral or vertical zones within the host matrix or as blocky or equant 
crystals along fracture surfaces.  Gangue minerals include calcite (with occasional Fe and/or Mn 
carbonates), fluorite, and locally abundant amounts of adularia.  

7.6  TARGET AREAS 
The following is a synopsis of the targets where HDG conducted drilling followed by a brief description of 
additional targets that are identified in the project area. 

7.6.A  JUMBO TREND 
The Jumbo Trend is located in the east-central part of the project area and consists of four previously 
identified target areas, including from North to South, North Jumbo, Jumbo/Shark's Mouth, State Section, 
and Etna (Figure 7-5). The Jumbo Trend extends approximately 10 km and is coincident with a significant 
ZTEM anomaly that appears to continue under colluvium.  HDG has completed a total of 45 holes in the 
Jumbo Trend from 2010 through 2013. Prior to this, Astral completed nine drill holes in 2006, Amanda 
Resources completed three drill holes in 2003, and Energex completed ten drill holes in 1988. This body 
of data provides the basis for determining the inferred resource at Jumbo presented in this report, and is 
described below in Section 14.0.  Each of the additional target areas within the Jumbo Trend have some 
unique characteristics, and are described below.

7.6.B  JUMBO/SHARKS MOUTH ZONE 
The main Jumbo target consists of a prominent vein zone that is up to 30 metres wide along a north-
south strike and a steep easterly dip that forms outcrops as shown in Figure 3-1.  The Shark's Mouth area 
lies at the southern end of the Jumbo target, and is characterized by numerous veins and stockworks over 
a broad area of up to 150 metres wide.  Within the Jumbo vein system there is a massive quartz and 
quartz/calcite vein portion that can exceed 5 metres width: This is typically in the center of the vein 
system or zone and forms a distinct linear/planar pattern which contrasts with the somewhat braided 
appearance of the stockwork portions of the vein system. Much of this central quartz vein is dense, fine-
grained quartz which on close inspection can occasionally be seen to contain relict rounded pebble 
breccias, banding, and bladed texture after calcite. The distribution and form of the breccias clasts 
indicate that they are derived from repeated hydrothermal brecciation and fluidization within the vein 
system. In some areas the breccia consists of angular silicified wall-rock clasts in a quartz matrix. The 
quartz veins at Jumbo exhibit bladed texture which suggests that boiling occurred within the 
hydrothermal system, and is typical for a low sulfidation epithermal system, as described below in section 
9.0.  Adjacent to the veins and breccias there are surrounding areas of quartz stockwork veining that 
becomes more diffuse away from the main vein structures.  To the south, in the Shark's Mouth area, the 
vein structures are less prominent and the system is characterized by numerous veins, hydrofracture, 
microbreccias and stockworks over a broad area.   

Locally within the vein system, there are somewhat discontinuous zones of quartz veins, silicified wall-
rock and quartz stockwork in both the foot-wall and hanging-wall of the central vein zone, which appears 
to form an enigmatic pattern like an "S" so that north of drill hole number GS-10-5 (Figure 10-1) 
silicification is observed on the west or foot-wall side of the central, dominant vein while south of that 
drill hole it is on the east or hanging-wall side. Within this southern, hanging-wall portion there appear to 
be complex vein relationships with multiple short, interconnected vein segments that form an 
anastomosing pattern to the overall structure. Near drill hole number GS-06-01 there are outcrops of 
"vein" in the hanging-wall that forms an arc of stockwork and breccia with quartz matrix, these appear to 
enclose short segments of northwesterly trending veins and this may prove to be structurally important 
in understanding possible loci for some of the higher-grade intercepts of gold-silver mineralization 
encountered in GS-06-01.  

Detailed mapping of portions of the Jumbo vein system suggests that there may be a significant, relatively 
late stage quartz deposition episode that formed the prominent large outcrops of quartz at the Jumbo 
vein system. This late stage of quartz appears to over-print and cement the earlier hydrothermal pebble 
breccias and blade texture after calcite. The south end of the prominent Jumbo structural zone appears 
to have been offset by E-W trending post-mineral faulting along Jumbo Creek.   

Wall-rock alteration surrounding the Jumbo vein system, typically extends outward from the vein into the 
adjacent andesite wall-rock. In some instances, a narrow selvedge of sericitic alteration is observed 
adjacent to the veins and grades into relatively fresh, propylitic alteration in the andesite. In general, 
there is an intense argllic alteration selvedge observed adjacent to, and along the hanging wall of the vein

zone and this may be the result of an incursion of acidic fluids. It also appears that pyrite is 
paragenetically associated with an early event and not the later low-sulfidation gold mineralization. It is 
not clear if the early pyrite event is associated with gold mineralization. The low-sulfidation alkaline fluids 
which formed the main quartz-adularia+/- calcite veins created a QSP (quartz-sericite/illite-pyrite) 
alteration assemblage proximal to the main structural conduit. Outboard the cooler K-rich fluids appear 
to have over-printed the early propylitic (chlorite-epidote) alteration with K-Fe smectite (celadonite) 
which is described as blue-green QSP alteration.  This alteration type may or may not be associated with 
Au-Ag mineralization, but there is a direct correlation between Au-Ag and the strength of the veining, 
from coarsely crystalline vuggy quartz to finely crystalline quartz hydrofractured microbreccias.  During 
2013, exploration in the Jumbo area found additional mineralization in the hanging wall of the main 
Jumbo vein intercepted in drill hole J-13-007, which is a previously untested area under the main access 
road.  Sampling of a prospect located in the flats east of Jumbo Ridge returned 3.7 g/t Au and may 
indicate additional zones of hanging wall or parallel mineralization east of the main Jumbo zone.  In 
addition, wide zones of mineralization were intercepted in the South Jumbo-Sharks Mouth area where 
there is potential for a bulk tonnage resource.  

A series of ten, E-W, five foot channel sample lines were completed along Jumbo Ridge with a focus on 
the exposed Jumbo vein zone.  The sampling was generally conducted along E-W breaks in the massive 
quartz outcrop zone.  Sampling was conducted with a 5 or 10 pound sledge hammer with continuous rock 
chips collected on a tarp.  Sampling results show strong Au-Ag mineralization along the surface as shown 
in Table 7-2 below. The northernmost two lines contained moderately anomalous Au-Ag values.

TMI is continuing detailed analysis to determine the significance of the post-mineral tuffs in the Jumbo 
area, this include re-logging the drill samples from previous HDG drilling and continue mapping the inliers 
of post-mineral tuffs in the Jumbo system. 

7.6.C  NORTH JUMBO TARGET 
The North Jumbo target is a northern extension of the Jumbo Trend and is primarily defined by the ZTEM 
work by HDG and the CSAMT survey conducted by Astral.  The majority of this area is covered by post-
mineral colluvium. HDG completed one hole on the North Jumbo Target in 2102. The hole encountered a 
few intervals containing significant gold mineralization, the best intercept is 3.05 metres @ 1.75 g/t Au 
and 53.7 g/t Ag (Table 10-7).  

7.6.D  STATE SECTION TARGET (SHARKS BELLY) 
HDG controls portions of the Utah Trust Lands in section 36, T20W, R33S. These lands are on the 
southern projection of the Jumbo zone and along a strong ZTEM resistivity anomaly. There are numerous 
small pits located on these lands with wide areas of clay+/- sericite alteration.  

Mapping and sampling were completed on this target in 2012. The results of this work outlined several 
drill targets based on structural intersections and ZTEM resistivity anomalies. Sampling of the vein 
systems have produced values in rock chip samples of up to 6.7g/t Au over 2 metres from a prominent 
vein. Other veins commonly carry gold values in the 1 to 2 g/t range.  A total of six holes were complete 
within the State Section. All holes contained zones of low-grade gold mineralization with drill hole SS-12-
002 returning 6.1 metres @ 2.2 g/t Au. This hole was drilled under post mineral cover and was located 
to test a ZTEM anomaly.  Mapping in the southern portion of the State section identified areas of post-
mineral latite flows that cover a strongly altered and stockwork veined older andesite-latite flow, these 
are similar to the younger latite flows observed at the Etna zone.

7.6.E  ETNA TARGET 
HDG has completed three RC drill holes on the Etna target during 2012.  Past operators conducted 
extensive rock chip sampling and Energex and Astral completed six RC drill holes (Caulfield, 1988; Smith, 
2005).  The Etna Zone is located in the south-eastern portion of the Gold Springs project. Mineralization 
at the Etna occurs primarily as quartz stockwork in brecciated andesite that forms a prominent ridge that 
extends from Newell Spring, on the south, for 1500 metres to the north.  Vein mineralization dips 
consistently 60 degrees to the west.  The outcropping width of the Etna zone varies from 30-75 metres 
(100-250 feet) with the greatest widths generally to the north (the area near the shaft). The silicified 
andesite locally forms large cliff outcrops along the eastern side of the ridge, primarily where the 
structure terminates against a footwall country rock, which has eroded away. 

In the Etna target, hanging-wall mineralization occurs primarily as quartz healed breccia that grades west 
into quartz stockwork mineralization. Individual quartz veins are normally less than 0.6 metres (2 feet) 
thick, unlike other areas in the project area where the quartz vein structures are the dominant 
mineralized features.  Alteration consists of silicification occurring in variable amounts and re-cemented 
breccias and stockwork zones that grade into variably argillized andesite in the hanging wall of the vein 
system. 

Figure 7-6: View of Stockwork Veining in the Etna System 

 

The Etna Mine is located on the northern end of the mineralized zone as shown in Figure 5-1. An inclined 
shaft accessed the mine workings in which several hundred feet of workings were driven on the 100 foot 
level (Perry, 1976).  TMI has a database of rock chip sampling from Astral Mining and Cambior, and this 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 51 of 167 

data shows that numerous samples contain greater than 100 ppb gold with a high of 27.9 ppm have been 
collected along the Etna vein system.   Data from the ZTEM surveys suggest that the Etna and Jumbo 
zones correlate to a larger resistivity anomaly that extends for 10 kilometres in a north-south direction, 
and define the Jumbo Trend. Two drill holes completed by Energex are reported to have intersected long 
intervals of gold and silver mineralization during their work in 1988, one of these drill holes is reported to 
have contained an intercept of 91.44 metres averaging 0.5 g/t Au including 24.4 metres at 1.46 g/t Au 
(Smith, 2005).  

During 2012 HDG completed three drill holes in the Etna target. The first drill hole was to twin an Energex 
hole that was reported to bottom in 3.05 metres @ 9.3 g/t Au at a depth of 91.44 metres and contained 
44.2 metres at a gold grade of 0.88 g/t Au (Caulfield, 1988, Smith, 2005). The drill site is located on the 
northern end of Etna Ridge. The HDG drill hole E-12-001 intercepted 1.5 metres @ 4.9 g/t Au at the same 
depth as the Energex hole encountered the 3.05 metres @ 9.3 g/t. The 2012 HDG drill holes intersected 
39.6 metres @ 0.57 g/t Au (E-12-001, between 61-100.6 m). 

7.6.F  GREY EAGLE 
The Grey Eagle target is characterized by a complex zone of intersecting veins trending north-south, 
northeast and northwest within a NNE trending structural zone dipping 50-85o west. The structure is 
interpreted to be a segment of a caldera ring fracture system which is also observed in the ZTEM 
geophysical data. The veins form a mineralized corridor ranging from 20 to over 75 metres in width, 
which is traceable on the surface for over 700 metres before being obscured by post-mineral cover. The 
individual veins and vein zones are characterized by white quartz, crustiform, colloform banding, comb, 
and pseudomorphs of silica after bladed calcite forms. Calcite and fluorite have been observed both in 
outcrop and in drill samples. Areas of both stockwork and sheeted veining are present in both the 
hanging wall and footwall to the dominant veins. Breccias cemented by silica are often noted in close 
proximity to these vein structures.  There are a number of historic shafts and adits located within the 
mineralized corridor, but most are inaccessible at this time.  

Rock chip sampling in the Grey Eagle target has been conducted across this broad area of mineralization 
and has resulted in values of up to 13.85 g/t gold and 35.3 g/t silver.   During 2012, HDG completed a 60 
metre-long trench across a portion of the southern Grey Eagle zone and opened two historic 
underground workings.  The trench exposes a zone of 56.4 metres @ 1.4 g/t Au and 10.1 g/t Ag. The 
trench is cut nearly perpendicular to the strike of the mineralized zone consisting of five main north-south 
striking veins between 1.5 to 8 metres thick and numerous smaller veinlets of varying orientation. HDG 
collected 22 select vein and surrounding host rock samples throughout the length of the trench.  The gold 
values range from 0.12 g/t to 8.59 g/t Au, and the average value for all samples is 1.4 g/t Au with values 
between.  The 2013 drilling demonstrated that mineralization extends towards the south and west where 
it lies beneath post mineral cover consisting of tuff, rhyolite flows and colluvium.    

Additional surface sampling and trenching was conducted in the Grey Eagle target area in 2013. A series 
of eight, 5 foot continuous chip-channel samples across vein exposures along the north Main Ridge vein 
zone was conducted with line spacing of 50-100 metres. The results showed strong Au-Ag mineralization 
(350-2200 ppb Au) in most of the 5 foot channel samples (Table 7-2).   

An 800 foot (244 m) long trench was excavated along the northern Grey Eagle Canyon ridge-line, to 
expose the northern extension of the Main Grey Eagle Vein zone.  Detailed sampling and mapping were 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 52 of 167 

completed of the >20 metre thick main vein/stockwork zone and a series of complex, cross-cutting to 
sub-parallel footwall structural zones with variable quartz-calcite, +/-fluorite stockwork.  

HDG to date has completed 74 drill holes in the Grey Eagle area for a total of 6890 metres.  The drilling in 
2013 was successful in extending known mineralization an additional 420 metres along strike to the south 
beneath a cover of post-mineral tuffs and clastics.  The mineralization consists of three anastomosing 
quartz-calcite sheeted vein-stockwork zones ranging from 45-100 metres in cumulative thickness that are 
oriented N30oE and dip 50-65oW.   

Figure 7-7: Trench in the Grey Eagle Zone 

 
HDG trench through the southern Grey Eagle target area, showing vein mineralization 
 

At the Grey Eagle target, Energex conducted underground sampling from an adit (Deering et al., 1985) 
that is beneath the trench that was excavated in 2012 by HDG. The results (pre 43-101) from the Energex 
channel sampling report intervals of  0.91 metres @ 0.37 oz/t Au, 1.83 metres @ 0.20 oz/t Au, 0.91 
metres @ 0.33 oz/t Au, 0.91 metres @ 0.31 oz/t Au, 0.91 metres @ 0.20 oz/t Au and 3.5 metres @ 0.40 
oz/t Au. These samples were all reported to have been collected from an underground stope that is in the 
footwall portion of the mineralized zone (Figure 7-8). During 2012, HDG collected select samples from 
these underground workings that showed values of up to 29.3 g/t Au and 47.4 g/t Ag, the samples are 
from quartz and quartz-calcite veins, stockwork zones and matrix-supported breccia cemented by silica.  

The Grey Eagle inferred resource straddles what appears to be an east-west structural zone that 
separates the resource into two distinct domains, and corresponds to the east-west drainage. The 
northern domain is dominated by north-south trending structures and the southern portion appears to 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 53 of 167 

be controlled by a northeast structural zone, though north-south and northwest mineralized trends are 
also apparent. The southern portion appears to contain a high-grade zone within the overall mineralized 
interval that can be traced from the underground workings (Figure 7-8) on its northern end, to hole GE-
12-002 (21.4 metres @ 5.6 g/t Au and 32.4 g/t Ag), hole GE-12-015 (7.6 metres @ 6.2 g/t Au and 27.3 g/t 
Ag), and hole GE-13-005 (9.1 metres @ 4.3 g/t Au and 20.1g/t Ag) for a distance of approximately 320 
metres. This zone remains open to the southwest and at depth.

In the Grey Eagle system gold and silver are hosted within stacked quartz‐calcite veins, stockwork, and

close proximity to the precious metal mineralization and that some of the calcite appears to be

7.6.G  THOR ZONE 
The Thor vein is in the SE1/4 of section 32, T1N, R71E and is approximately 180 metres west of the Jennie 
Vein. The Jennie was one of the districts largest producing mines with a reported grade of 0.4 oz/t over 
widths of 1.5 to 7 metres (Perry, 1976). The Thor vein is poorly exposed along the surface due to colluvial 
cover, but can be traced for more than 300 metres in shallow pits and trenches.  The Thor vein is 
reported to be offset on the north and south by post-mineral faults (Perry, 1976). The Thor vein strikes 
northwest with a variable easterly dip, but also rolls over and dips to the west. The vein varies in width 
from 0.6 to 6 metres and consists of quartz, calcite, adularia, sometimes exhibiting distinct bands of high-
grade mineralization which have been mined, and other mineralized bands that have been left behind as 
waste. Unlike the Jumbo, Grey Eagle and Homestead targets there is no significant wallrock 
mineralization observed surrounding the Thor vein structure. Samples of the vein mineralization exhibits 
banded quartz and adularia, sparse oxidized sulfide grains, visible gold grains, and rock samples that 
assay up to 23.35 g/t Au and 252.9 g/t Ag. A rock chip sample across a 2 metre section of the Thor vein 
left behind by early mining, assayed 3.28 g/t gold (sample KK-11-39), and the location is shown in Figure 
7-12.  The mapping and detailed rock chip sampling conducted by HDG demonstrates that there are at 
least three narrow (0.2-1.0 metre) parallel veins located in the footwall for the Thor vein.

Figure 7-12: Vein Exposed in Caved Stopes at the Thor Mine 

 
Sample KK-11-39 was collected across 2 metres of this structure  Vein exposed in caved stope at the 
Thor Mine, assays 3.1 g/t gold across the 2 metres face shown above. 
 

HDG completed a total of three drill holes in the Thor target area during 2011. One core hole was drilled 
to intersect the vein in an area of historic work, and contained several intercepts with values >3.0 g/t 
gold.  Two additional reverse circulation drill holes were completed approximately 100 metres south of 
the core drill hole.  Each of these drill holes intersected vein material and contained significant gold 
values as shown in Table 10-5 below. 

7.6.H  SILICA HILL/SILICA HILL EXTENSION 
These areas are located to the west and are generally sub-parallel to the Thor vein, and are exposed by 
numerous small pits and trenches. The area is covered by colluvium that contains abundant float vein 
fragments along the projections of the outcropping veins suggesting the material is locally derived. These 
targets contain veins displaying visible gold with assays reaching highs of 126.326 g/t gold. The Silica Hill 
and Silica Hill Extension are N20oW trending zones that are 1600 metres in length displaying widths of up 
to 300 metres in which these narrow high-grade veins are found. The projection of the target extends to 
both the north and south and trends under post mineral cover. Veins within the corridor generally exhibit 
orientations of N35oE, N30oW and N10oW all of which contain gold mineralization. 

Three holes were completed within the Silica Hill area. Two drill holes contained zones of significant gold 
mineralization ranging up to 1.86 g/t gold (SH-12-002, 86.9-88.4 m). Hole SH-12-002 was lost after it 
entered a void thought to be a solution cavity. Just prior to entering the void the hole contained 4.6 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 58 of 167 

metres @ 1.04 g/t gold (SH-12-002, 86.9-91.4 m). The void is thought to be a possible dissolution cavity in 
a calcite vein. The third hole failed to reach the target depth (Table 10-7). 

7.6.I  HOMESTEAD TARGET 
The Homestead target is located in the northwest portion of the property on patented lands under lease 
by HDG. This target is dominated by a 3 metre-wide north-south to NE striking vein system with an 
intersecting 5 metre-wide N350E vein (Figure 7-13).  In addition there is a wide zone of up to 100 metres 
of sheeted northeast trending veins exposed in an old road cut. This zone can be traced along strike to 
where it is obscured by post mineral volcanic rocks and colluvium. There are several shafts located within 
the Homestead zone, however, there is no recorded historic production.  

HDG has conducted rock chip sampling in the Homestead area with results that include values up to 
8.169 g/t Au and 8.9 g/t Ag. A total of five RC holes were drilled by HDG in 2011.   In 2013 HDG completed 
a series of seven continuous chip/channel sample lines that cross the Homestead target in 2013. 
Sampling was conducted across vein zone exposures that are generally 7-30 metres wide and assay 0.30-
1.20 g/t Au as shown in Table 7-2.  

Figure 7-13: Vein Exposed in Caved Stope at the Homestead Mine 

 

7.6.J  FLUORITE TARGET 
Bull Hill is the historic name for the prominent hill to the north of the Pope Mine, as shown in Figure 7-15.  
Bull Hill is a resurgent rhyolite dome within the Gold Springs caldera, and is surrounded by intercalated 
flows and tuffaceous sediments and tuffs that accumulated within the caldera moat (Best, 1992).  Locally, 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 59 of 167 

the rocks exhibit opaline silicification, which may represent the near-surface expression of an epithermal 
system as described by Hedenquist (2000) and shown schematically in Figure 8-1.  Mineralization at the 
Fluorite target area is unusual, and consists of a vertical shaft (Figure 7-14) and a lower adit that explore a 
fluorite-bearing pipe that cuts the rhyolite and tuffs  surrounded by a broad area of phyllic alteration.  
The "vein" structure is reported to trend N 20oE, and averages 0.7-1.0 metre wide, mineralization consists 
of purple and green fluorite, crustiform lattice quartz, and red earthy hematite. The hematite often 
occurs as thin seams between bands of fluorite and appears later than the quartz. The hematite material 
will produce a nice tail of gold when panned, and samples taken of the fluorite have resulted in assays of 
up to 23.45 g/t gold. HDG completed three drill holes on the Fluorite target. Each hole intercepted the 
target structure with fluorite associated with hematite muds, and typically followed along the margins of 
a younger latite dike that cut the rhyolite flows. The latite dike appears to have a NW strike and near 
vertical dip. Gold values from the holes were anomalous in gold and the drilling showed that these 
structures continue along strike and at depth. 

Additional geological work is required to better understand the gold mineralization in the Fluorite area, it 
appears to be directly associated with the caldera complex and is a distinctly separate style of 
mineralization than the vein systems observed elsewhere in the district, and possibly a later stage of gold 
mineralization. 

Figure 7-14: The Shaft at the Fluorite Target Area 

 
The shaft at the Fluorite target area, note the abundant red hematite staining and the banded fluorite 
veining. 

7.6.K  POPE TARGET 
The Pope Mine area is located in the central part of the current Gold Springs project and differs from the 
other targets described above, and may be unique in the style of gold mineralization described in the 
district.  The Pope target consists of numerous narrow sheeted quartz veins and clay seams which cut 
welded tuffs associated with the resurgent rhyolitic dome in the Gold Springs caldera.  These veins 
generally strike east-west and are surrounded by a broad area of sericitic alteration, and narrow veinlets

Page 60 of 167 

and stockwork of quartz-adularia veins that individually can assay as high as 19.06 g/t gold and 70 g/t 
silver.  Rock chip samples reported by Cambior in 1997 indicated that anomalous gold values of up to 0.57 
g/t were obtained from the silicified tuff unit (Katsura, 1997). 

HDG completed two holes in the Pope Target area. Drill hole P-12-001 intersected an open stope 
between 56.4 metres and 62.5 metres, and at 72.6 metres the drill hole intersected 1.5 metres @ 9.2 g/t 
Au (Table 10-7). The second hole failed to get to target depth due to poor drilling conditions.  

Figure 7-15: : View from the Pope Mine Looking Towards Bull Hill 

 
 

7.6.L  TIN CAN 
This area is located north of the historic Little Buck mine and is characterized by a wide area of strong 
sericitic alteration with pyrite casts. There are a few historic pits with abundant vein float covering the 
hillside. HDG has done little work on this target but the CSAMT survey conducted by Astral shows this 
area to be underlain by a resistivity anomaly. 

Three holes were drilled in the Tin Can Target area in 2012. Two holes were drilled westerly to test the 
CSAMT anomaly. These holes generally intersected intervals of low-grade gold mineralization hosted by 
andesite.  The highest individual assay interval was in TC-12-001 where interval 105.2-106.7 metres (1.5 
metres) assayed 1.9 g/t Au. Drill hole TC-12-003 was drilled in an easterly direction to test a northeast 
trending structural zone consisting of quartz veins and stockworks, and the hole was lost in a void 
thought to be a solution cavity. The gold values were increasing in this drill hole prior to it entering the 
void with an interval of 12.2 metres (141.7-153.9 metres) averaging 0.35 g/t Au, and where silver values 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 61 of 167 

averaged 15.9 g/t over the bottom 3.05 metres (150.85-153.9 m).  Abundant calcite veining was observed 
in these intervals. 

7.6.M  MIDNIGHT TARGET 
The Midnight target area is located in the southern portion of the property. The target is covered by 
patented claims controlled by HDG. One of the largest shafts found within the project area is located on 
the Midnight vein system. In the 1990s these patented claims were leased to a group that initiated 
excavation of a production size adit in the area of the shaft but never progressed beyond a depth of 20 
metres. There are numerous cuts across the adjacent hillside areas that explore several smaller veins and 
stockwork zones within this vein system. A second shaft is located on a parallel vein approximately 50 
metres east of the main shaft. Material from this working returned gold values of up to 57.3 g/t Au. A 
third parallel vein/silicified zone is located approximately 70 metres further east and was the target of 
several old diggings and small shafts. This eastern most zone can be traced for approximately 600 metres 
in a north-south direction, all within the patented claim block.  HDG has conducted surface rock chip 
sampling in the Midnight area that indicates a potentially wide area of gold mineralization associated 
with predominantly north-south trending veins, sub-parallel faults, sheeted veins, and stockwork zones. 
Veins are characterized by white massive quartz, pale pink to gray to white colloform banding, druse-
lined quartz fracture surfaces and/or vugs, and pseudomorphs of silica after bladed calcite forms with 
surrounding areas of intense argillization and/or propylitization.  The rock sampling results include 
numerous samples of +0.1 g/t Au with values up to 57.3 g/t Au and 59.4 g/t Ag. In 2010 HDG completed 2 
RC holes on the Midnight target, the results were encouraging, however, problems with the drilling 
included one hole that passed through two unanticipated open stopes in the underground workings.   

During 2013, two east-west trenches were completed across portions of the main north-east striking vein 
system.  The two trenches and an additional five E-W, sample lines located approximately 100 metres 
apart were completed at the Midnight target during 2013 (Figure 7-16).  The sample lines consisted of a 
series of 5 foot continuous chip-channel samples collected across exposures of a prominent quartz vein 
stockwork zones.  The results are shown in Table 7-2, and results indicate widespread, anomalous gold 
mineralization with variable concentrations from 0.20-1.10 g/t Au.

Excavated and Sampled by HDG during 2013 

 

7.6.N  NORTH JENNIE TARGET 
Astral completed one hole on the North Jennie target which is reported in their data. Astral defined this 
target based on interpretations of the CSAMT survey conducted by Zonge Geoscience and the target is 
located beneath a thick cover of Quaternary gravels at the drill collar.  Astral's drill hole demonstrated 
that gold mineralization is present along the northern projection of the Jennie vein system. This 
projection corresponds to the resistivity anomaly shown in the CSAMT survey data.  The majority of this 
area is covered by post-mineral colluvium. 

7.6.O  CAMP BELL/LOST WORLD 
Camp Bell and Lost World represent developing targets on the Gold Springs project. Reconnaissance 
prospecting at Gold Springs has focused primarily on areas of colluvial cover south and west of the 2010 
claim block following anomalies identified by the ZTEM data.  These targets are characterized by linear 
traces of vein material as float containing high grade gold mineralization hosted in these vein fragments. 
The fragments range in size from 0.2 metres to 1 metre across and consist of quartz, calcite, adularia, 
with bladed quartz and adularia textures formed after calcite. The linear zones of mineralized vein float 
follow the predominant orientation of the major veins within the district.  Considering the large ribs that 
form in some of the vein systems, such as the Jumbo, one hypothesis is that the source of these float 
trains may be locally derived and represent residual traces of these structures.  Assays as high as 145.68 
g/t gold and 148.2 g/t silver have been generated from samples of the float material and gold grades of >

3 g/t gold are not uncommon.  Continued exploration of this type of target will require either trenching or 
drilling to determine the presence of subsurface mineralization. 

7.6.P  CHARLIE ROSS 
This target is similar to the Pope in that it is hosted within tuffs along the margin of the caldera. This area 
has not received any detailed work by HDG but initial investigations reveal occasional narrow veins in a 
broad area of sericite and clay alteration. Samples of altered and hematite stained tuff have returned 
gold values as high as 1.3 g/t.  Historical reports describe a "175 foot shaft with a 40 foot talc zone with 
high-grade streaks and shipments up to $2,900/ton with tellurides of gold "(+100 opt) in gold (Tschanz 
and Pampeyan, 1970).  The collar of the shaft is situated about 150 feet above the apparent 
rhyolite/andesite unconformity and the contact may be a potential target associated with the Gold 
Springs caldera. 

7.6.Q  HORSESHOE EXTENSION 
The historic Horseshoe mine was one of the largest producers in the historic Fay District. The northern 
projection of this north-south structural vein system extends into an area of extensive colluvial cover. 
This area contains numerous shafts which were collared in the colluvium and display gold bearing vein 
fragments on the dumps. There are rare outcrops of andesite which generally display stockwork veining 
that have returned values of up to 4.0 g/t Au from rock chip samples collected across over 1 metre 
intervals.   

7.6.R  IRIS 
The Iris zone is located in the north-western corner of the Gold Springs project. The vein strikes N5oE and 
rolls steeply to the east and to the west. The vein can be traced on the ground for over 600 metres (2000 
feet) prior to going under post-mineral cover.  The Iris mine produced high-grade gold from unknown 
widths. Samples from old ore piles return gold grades of 12.5 g/t. Of significance is that the area is 
characterized by wide zones of small and multiple parallel veins that cut the andesites in both the 
footwall and hanging wall of the main vein.  During 2013, four drill holes (GE13-017 to 020) were 
completed to test the southern extension of the Iris zone, these holes failed to intercept mineralization 
comparable to that observed in the historic workings.  

7.6.S  KENO 
The Keno target is a N-S structural zone that intersects the Grey Eagle target in the vicinity of the trench 
excavated by HDG in 2012.  This structure is characterized an open-space quartz breccia vein and is 
developed by one adit.  Underground channel sampling was conducted during 2013 and did not reveal 
any significant gold mineralization to date. 

8.0   DEPOSIT TYPES 
Gold mineralization on the Gold Springs project is characterized by structurally controlled vein and 
stockwork systems that are laterally extensive over a strike length of several kilometres. The veins exhibit 
quartz, adularia and low sulfide contents that are typical of a deposit type referred to as "low-sulfidation 
epithermal deposits" (Brommecker et al., 2007).   Examples of this deposit type include Hishikari, Japan 
(Etoh et al., 2002), the Republic district, Washington, and Midas, Nevada (Leavitt et al., 2004).  These 
systems have been correlated with fossil hot springs, and the hydrothermal systems that underlie them,

that developed in response to alkalic and silicic volcanic activity, commonly in a caldera setting 
(Brommecker et al., 2007).  One of the characteristics that help classify the Gold Springs systems as a 
"low-sulfidation epithermal deposit" are the observed textures of quartz, adularia, and calcite in the vein 
deposits and would be tentatively correlative with the "vein ore" shown in Figure 8-2 below.  These areas 
of "vein ore" are typically surrounded by broad areas of stockwork mineralization, and/or areas of altered 
and fractured wall rock where increased permeability hosts disseminated gold mineralization.  The 
mineralization observed in the Bull Hill and Pope Mine areas may correspond to some of the upper levels 
of a hot springs system, as shown in Figure 8-1, or may be a part of a completely different style of gold 
mineralization.  Ongoing detailed geologic work by HDG is focusing on a better understanding of the 
mineralization in these target areas.   

Figure 8-1: Schematic Cross Section Showing Components in a Low Sulfidation Epithermal System 

 
Schematic cross section showing components in a low sulfidation epithermal system, after Hedenquist 
et al., 2000. 

 
Several well documented "low sulfidation" epithermal gold systems include the El Penon deposit in Chile, 
where structurally controlled veins containing quartz, adularia, cut felsic volcanic units and are associated 
with waning rhyolitic volcanic activity (Robbins, 2000).  Silicification extends outward from the veins into 
the country rock, with sericitic alteration haloes.  The precious metal-bearing veins exhibit stockworks, 
breccias, banded texture, comb quartz, and bladed texture in quartz that replaces carbonates (Robbins, 
2000).  The Midas deposit in Nevada is another low sulfidation epithermal deposit that is structurally 
controlled near the margins of a volcanic complex, and is known for very high-grade gold ores hosted by 
veins (Leavitt et al., 2004).

Figure 8-2: Bladed Texture and Banding in Quartz Vein Sample from the Jumbo System 

 
 
Low sulfidation epithermal gold deposits commonly exhibit a vertical zoning for precious metals that 
correspond to the levels of boiling that occurred within the hydrothermal system.  Episodic sealing and 
explosive activity formed the breccias and stockworks commonly observed in the structures, and the 
concurrent rapid pressure changes resulted in the precipitation of carbonates, and in many cases the 
subsequent resorption and replacement of the carbonates by quartz that result in a lattice-texture and 
bladed texture where quartz replaces calcite (Simmons and Christenson, 1994).  These textures are noted 
as an important feature and observation in the mineralized zones of low sulfide systems because it 
records the rapid changes associated with the boiling zone and is associated with the precipitation of gold 
(Etoh et al., 2002).  Low sulfidation epithermal systems are noted for distinct vertical zoning of ore 
horizons that correspond to the boiling level in the system (Etoh et al., 2002), and have been reported to 
range generally from <300 m to almost 1km vertically (Brommecker et al., 2007).  This vertical zoning of 
precious metal mineralization has also been documented in systems such as Midas, Nevada (Leavitt et al., 
2000). 

The alteration associated with low sulfidation epithermal systems commonly exhibit silicification proximal 
to the veins and stockworks, illite alteration, and distal propylitic alteration in the country rocks, with 
some vertical zonation of clay minerals that have been noted ranging from higher temperature (deeper) 
illite to low temperature (shallow) kaolinite in the wall rock alteration assemblage (Simmons et al., 2005).  
Low sulfidation epithermal systems associated with alkalic volcanism may exhibit V-rich mica and 
abundant carbonate minerals in the alteration surrounding the veins (Jensen and Barton, 2000).  In some 
examples, massive opaline silica and siliceous sinter can form, and generally indicate a very shallow level 
in the system that corresponds to where the paleowater table intersected surface topography (Simmons 
et al., 2005). 

In the Gold Springs project area, gold mineralization is typically hosted by andesites, and is also 
associated with the rhyolitic volcanism (caldera formation). The vein systems exhibit silicification adjacent 
to the structures, sericitic alteration, and distal propylitic alteration in the andesites.  In the Bull Hill and 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 66 of 167 

Pope Mine areas, mineralization is hosted by rhyolitic flows and tuffs, and alteration appears to have a 
different character, dominated by sericitic alteration with fluorite and carbonate. 

9.0   EXPLORATION 
The HDG work program from 2010 through 2013 has collected 2,409 rock chip samples, 2,964 soil 
samples and 323 stream sediment samples during its exploration efforts.  

The following is a description of the specific sampling techniques employed by HDG in exploring the 
project. 

9.1  ROCK CHIP 
Rock chip samples were collected by HDG geologists and described in the field and located by hand held 
GPS units. These samples were designed to define mineral distribution within the vein systems and wall 
rocks. The majority of the samples were collected on a reconnaissance basis from both outcrop and float 
material. These samples were designed to delineate areas which host mineralization and locate gold 
occurrences both within and proximal to the project area. The reconnaissance sampling lead to the 
locating and filing of additional claims by HDG to cover areas of mineralization identified through the rock 
chip samples.  

Sampling was also conducted within the target areas where outcropping mineralization was sampled 
perpendicular to structural trends where possible. Grab samples were collected to help define 
background geochemical levels within the various rock units and to evaluate metallic ion distribution and 
chemical zonation in areas of new exploration.  Select samples were also collected from mine dumps and 
vein exposures to determine if there were any specific geochemical signatures and to characterize the 
ability of the system to contain high-grade gold values.   

During 2013 detailed follow-up sampling and mapping was conducted on several of the target areas.  This 
work included detailed structural analysis and channel sampling as well as detailed vein sampling on the 
main Grey Eagle trench, North Grey Eagle Ridge trench, North Iris trench, and the Upper and Lower 
Midnight trenches.  In addition a series of channel sample lines were completed over the exposed vein 
zones at the Jumbo, Midnight, Grey Eagle, and Homestead target areas.  These channel sample lines 
generally consist of a series of 5-foot long, continuous chip-channel samples across outcropping 
exposures of the various vein-stockwork zones.  In local areas with only subcrop exposed, 10 foot 
channels of subcrop/regolith were sometimes sampled.  This data is shown in Table 7-2. 

The geologic mapping, geochemical sampling and geophysical surveys conducted by HDG identified the 
numerous additional targets and lead to the expansion of the claim block at the end of the 2011 field 
season.  Mineralization occurs along high angle quartz veins and within the surrounding andesite as 
stockwork zones and disseminated mineralization.  Rock chip sampling has identified 18 target areas 
within the claim block. All areas have produced samples containing high-grade gold and silver 
mineralization and all require additional detailed geologic work and drilling to fully evaluate the mineral 
potential.

9.2  GEOPHYSICS 
9.2.A  Z-TEM 

In 2011 HDG completed a 470 line-km ZTEM and aeromagnetic helicopter survey. Previous ground 
CSAMT surveys revealed a positive correlation between the known epithermal gold systems and buried, 
subvertically-dipping resistivity high features. The ZTEM results correlated very well with CSAMT results 
and known geology, in particular the presence of all the known epithermal centers. This work indicated 
numerous additional targets in the project area which were later covered by additional federal lode 
claims. 

Figure 9-1: Helicopter conducting ZTEM survey for HDG during 2011 

 

During April 27–30, 2011 Geotech Ltd. carried out a helicopter-borne geophysical survey for HDG over 
the Gold Springs project. The principal geophysical sensors included a Z-Axis Tipper electromagnetic 
(ZTEM) system, and a caesium magnetometer. Ancillary equipment included a GPS navigation system and 
a radar altimetre. A total of 470 line-kilometres of geophysical data were acquired during the survey. 

The survey operations were based out of the town of Pioche, Nevada. In-field data quality assurance and 
preliminary processing were carried out on a daily basis during the acquisition phase. Preliminary and 
final data processing, including generation of final digital data and map products were undertaken from 
the office of Geotech Ltd. in Aurora, Ontario. 

The processed survey results were presented as the following maps: 

• 3D view of In-Phase Total Divergence versus Skin Depth (30-720Hz) 
• Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI)

Page 68 of 167 

• Digital Elevation Model (DEM) 
• Reduced to Pole (RTP) of Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) 
• First Vertical Derivative of RTP 
• Second Vertical Derivative of RTP 
• 30Hz In-Phase Total Divergence Grid 
• 90Hz In-Phase Total Divergence Grid 
• 360Hz In-Phase Total Divergence Grid 
• Tzx (In-line) In-Phase Profiles over 90Hz Phase Rotated In-Phase Grid 
• Tzx (In-line) Quadrature Profiles over a 90Hz Phase Rotated Quadrature Grid. 
• Tzy(Cross-line) In-Phase Profiles over 90Hz Phase Rotated In-Phase Grid 
• Tzy (Cross-line) Quadrature Profiles over a 90Hz Phase Rotated Quadrature Grid. 

In addition to above, Geotech was contracted to complete 2D inversion processing of the ZTEM data and 
more detailed processing of the magnetics including the development of first and second derivatives of 
the RTP. 

The survey was flown in an east to west (N 90° E azimuth) direction, with a flight line spacing of 200 
metres. Tie lines were flown in a north to south (N 0° E azimuth) direction, with a flight line spacing of 
1900 metres.  

DT (Total Divergence) imaging, analogous to the VLF Peaker parametre of Pedersen (1998), converts the 
ZTEM tipper cross-over data into peak-responses which assists their interpretation in plan. DT lows 
(conductive) areas signify areas with sulphides or possibly conductive clays and the DT highs (resistive) 
areas, represent resistive rocks which show an excellent correlation with known gold occurrences as 
would be expected in the low sulphidation environment. This correlation of resistive rocks and gold 
mineralization can also be demonstrated in the prior ground CSAMT. 

Subsequent to the 2D inversion completed by Geotech, Mira Geoscience was contracted to complete a 
3D inversion of both the ZTEM conductivity data and the magnetics. This work was carried out in 2012. 
The modelling process used geologic and geophysical modelling software including GOCAD, 

ZTEM_MT3D and MAG3D. The resulting models for the ZTEM and magnetic inversions provided a 3D 
conductivity model of the earth that honours the ZTEM and magnetic data to a specified level of fit. The 
modelling correctly considered 3D topographic effects which can significantly influence the data. The 
inversion modelling was unconstrained by geologic and physical property information.

Figure 9-2: ZTEM Resistivity Highs and Correlation with Outcropping Gold Bearing Rocks and Gold in 
Drill Holes in the Jumbo Resource Area 

 
The primary outcome of these studies was the development of a clear correlation with the location of 
surface gold mineralization and gold intersected in drill holes particularly with the margins of the high 
resistivity features. This correlation can be seen both in the "depth-slice" presentation (Figure 9-3) of the 
data and in cross-sections developed from the 3D inversion study (Figure 9-4). When the resistivity high is 
shallow a strong correlation between the margins of the resistivity highs and gold intersected in drill 
holes exists as can be seen in the Jumbo Resource area (Figure 9-4). When the resistivity high is deeper as 
at Grey Eagle, gold mineralization is found both at the margins and over the top of the resistivity features. 
This correlation is interpreted as relating to the heat source for the "hot spring" style mineralization seen 
at Gold Springs. The heat source being high silica, highly resistive rhyolites.

Presently, surface follow up of the resistive features is underway. In the case of the Jumbo Zone it can be 
seen to extend in the subsurface for several kilometres to the North of the area drilled to date and in the 
southern portion of the property this same feature can be seen to extend several kilometres to the south. 
It is thought that these extensions have an excellent potential for discovery of further gold mineralization.  
HDG is currently working with the geophysical data to help define targets and extensions of known gold 
mineralization where they may extend under the colluvial cover or be offset by fault structure. 

9.3  GEOCHEMICAL SAMPLING 
Significant gold anomalies have been generated through rock chip and soil sampling. High gold values are 
variably correlated with silver and arsenic. Other trace elements, such as antimony and mercury, and the 
base metals of copper, lead, and zinc generally occur in too small amounts to be a significant exploration 
tool. 

During the 2010 through 2013 field seasons, HDG collected 2,409 rock chip samples, 2,964 soil samples 
and 323 stream sediment samples from the project. Rock chip results ranged from <5 ppb gold to a high 
of 145.68 g/t gold. Silver shows some correlation with gold and values ranged from <0.1 ppm to a high of 
252.9 ppm. Gold geochemistry from the soil samples ranged from <0.5 ppb to a high of 1.3 g/t while silver 
ranges from <0.1 ppm to 11.6 ppm. Results from the stream sediment sampling show a variation in gold 
values from a low of <5 ppb to a high of 1.28 g/t. 

Preliminary analysis of some of the down-hole geochemical data suggests that there are at least two 
different signatures for the various target areas. Moderately anomalous arsenic and local molybdenum 
values is associated with gold mineralization in the Jumbo trend as shown in Figure 9-5, with a 
surrounding zone that shows a relative depletion in calcium, potassium and sodium.  In the Grey Eagle 
area, the gold mineralization is characterized by relatively low arsenic values, and an abundance in 
calcium and manganese (associated with extensive carbonate veining), and relative depletion in sodium 
as shown in Figure 9-6.

10.0   DRILLING 
As of the effective date of this Technical Report, HDG has completed drilling on the Jumbo Trend (46 
holes), Grey Eagle (74 holes), Thor (3 holes), Silica Hill (3 holes), Homestead (5 holes), Fluorite (3 holes), 
Pope (2 holes), Tin Can (3 holes), and the Midnight (2 holes) targets for a total 19,232.9 metres combined 
RC and diamond core drilling. Previous companies completed holes on the Jumbo (18 holes), Etna (6 
holes), Thor (2 holes) and North Jennie (1 hole) targets. In all cases the holes intersected gold 
mineralization. Results include both narrow high-grade intercepts and long intervals of lower-grade 
mineralization. HDG has now completed an update of the Gold Springs resource that incorporates the 
results from the 2013 exploration program.  The newly defined base case Indicated resource is 
21,289,000 tonnes @ 0.5 g/t Au and 9.8 g/t Ag for a contained 339,000 troy ounces gold and 6,687,000 
troy ounces silver plus a base case inferred resource of 16,674,000 tonnes @ 0.4 g/t Au and 9.1 g/t Ag for 
an additional 214,000 troy ounces gold and 4,857,000 troy ounces silver using a 0.2 g/t Au cutoff. This 
equates to a base case Indicated resource of 456,000 ounces AuEq averaging 0.67g/t AuEq and an 
additional 299,000 ounces AuEq @0.56 g/t AuEq in the Inferred category. Gold equivalent (AuEq) 
calculations reflect gross metal content using the gold/silver ratio of 57.14, and have not been adjusted 
for metallurgical recoveries. Numbers have been rounded, which may lead to some numbers not adding 
up exactly.  This mineralization remains open along strike and at depth.   

With initial resources estimated on two of the priority target areas there is additional work needed to 
understand and prioritize all of the remaining targets and to continue to develop the existing resources.  

In 2010 HDG completed a total of 11 reverse-circulation drill holes for a total 1,822.7 metres. Nine holes 
were located within the Jumbo system and two were located on the Midnight target. Holes located on 
the Jumbo target were designed to confirm past drilling and to infill areas between past drill holes.

In 2011 a total of 17 reverse-circulation holes totaling 1,631.9 metres and two core holes totaling 280.7 
metres were completed by HDG.  The 2011 drill program provided for the first drill testing of the Grey 
Eagle (10 RC holes) and the Homestead targets (5 RC holes). Three holes (2 RC holes and 1 core hole) 
were also completed on the Thor target in the general area where Energex reported completing several 
holes (data not available). One core hole was drilled on the Jumbo target as a twin of HDG hole J-10-04. 
The holes were logged by L. Campbell and R. Moore and the program was completed under the direction 
of Randall Moore, Executive Vice President of Exploration - North American for TriMetals. 

Each Drill Log includes details for the following categories:  Project, Name, Hole ID, Location UTM 
Northing and Easting, Elevation, Bearing, Dip, Total Length, Logged by, Date, and Contractor. The main 
portion of the drill logs provides details for the following categories: Sample number, footage interval, 
description of lithology, alteration and mineralization, and a numeric classification for identifying the 
abundance of  oxidizes, pyrite, silicification, adularia, sericite, clay, chlorite, veins, stockwork, veinlets, 
and faults.

In 2012 a total of 56 reverse-circulation holes totaling 7,171 metres were completed by HDG.  The 2012 
drill program provided for the drill testing of the Jumbo Trend (24 RC holes), Grey Eagle target (21 RC 
holes), Silica Hill target (3 RC holes), Fluorite target (3 RC holes), Pope target (2 RC holes), and Tin Can 
target (3 RC holes).  The drill holes were logged by L. Campbell, R. Moore, R. Silberman, P. Herrera, E. 
Turren and E. Hauser and the program was completed under the direction of Randall Moore, Executive 
Vice President of Exploration - North American for TriMetals. 

Each Drill Log includes details for the following categories:  Project, Name, Hole ID, Location UTM 
Northing and Easting, Elevation, Bearing, Dip, Total Length, Logged by, Date, Contractor, and Driller. The 
main portion of the drill logs provides details for the following categories: Sample number, footage 
interval, description of lithology, alteration and mineralization, and a numeric classification for identifying 
the abundance of  oxidizes, pyrite, silicification, adularia, sericite, clay, chlorite, veins, stockwork, veinlets, 
and faults.

In 2013 a total of 55 reverse-circulation holes totaling 8,283 metres were completed by HDG.  The 2013 
drill program provided for the drill testing of the Jumbo Trend (12 RC holes) and Grey Eagle target (43 RC 
holes) with a goal of adding ounces to the inferred resource.  The drill holes were logged by R. Moore, S. 
Tregaskis and L.Cahill and the program was completed under the direction of Scott Tregaskis, Project 
Manager and Randall Moore, Executive Vice President of Exploration - North American for TriMetals. 

Each Drill Log includes details for the following categories:  Project, Name, Hole ID, Location UTM 
Northing and Easting, Elevation, Bearing, Dip, Total Length, Logged by, Date, Contractor, and Date. The 
main portion of the drill logs provides details for the following categories: Sample number, footage 
interval, description of lithology, alteration and mineralization, and a numeric classification for identifying 
the abundance of  oxidizes, pyrite, silicification, adularia, sericite, clay, chlorite, veins, stockwork, veinlets, 
and faults.

10.1 RC DRILLING 
The following is a synopsis of the drilling conducted by HDG on the project to date. 

The 2010 drilling program was performed by Diversified Drilling and was done by wet reverse-circulation. 
Material coming out of the hole passed through a wet rotary splitter producing 2 samples of equal size. 
The samples were collected on 5 foot intervals and handled by HDG employees at all times. A geologist 
was at the drill site at all times during drilling. The geologist collected a small sample coming from the 
rotary splitter and placed it into chip trays labeled by drill hole number and footage. Samples were 
numbered with one split being designated as a duplicate sample. Duplicate samples were stored on site 
until the end of the drill program when they were transported to a locked storage facility in Cedar City, 
Utah. Samples for analysis were transported on a daily basis to a secured area behind locked gates with 
access secured. Drill samples were transported from the site to the Inspectorate Laboratory facility in 
Sparks, Nevada by HDG employees every 3 to 4 days and were delivered directly to laboratory personnel.  

The 2011 RC drill program was conducted by Drift Drilling and was done without injecting water. Material 
from the hole was passed through a Jones style splitter and 100% was collected in two equal splits on 5 
foot intervals. One split was labeled as a duplicate sample which was stored on site behind a locked 
access gate until the end of the drill program and then transported by HDG employees to a locked facility 
in Cedar City, Utah. Samples were handled at all times by HDG personnel and a geologist was present at

all times during drilling. The geologist collected a small portion of the duplicate sample which was placed 
into chip trays labeled by drill hole number and footage. Chips were then logged on site by the geologist. 
From the duplicate sample HDG filled a 4x6 inch zip lock bag labeled by drill hole number and footage. 
This material is intended to be used for chip boards and future petrographic study. Samples for analysis 
were transported from the drill to a secured area behind a locked gate on a daily basis. From the secured 
area samples were picked up by Inspectorate Laboratories and transported to their facilities in Sparks, 
Nevada.  

The 2012 and 2013 drilling programs were performed by Diversified Drilling and conducted by wet 
reverse-circulation drilling method. All reverse circulation "RC" samples were collected by, or under the 
direct supervision of a HDG geologist.  Emphasis was placed on quality control and the proper handling 
and numbering of all samples. The reverse circulation drill cuttings are collected as they come out of the 
drill hole from an industry standard rotary wet splitter provided by the drilling company, which delivers 
the material to three collection points. Samples are collected on 1.52 metre (5 foot) intervals. Material 
from the first collection point is designated for transport to Inspectorate Laboratories, located in Sparks, 
Nevada, USA for analysis. The material from the second sample point is retained as a duplicate sample for 
future testing if needed. The material from the third sample point is geologically logged onsite and put 
into chip trays which are labeled with sample numbers and footage intervals from which the sample was 
taken. In addition to the chip trays a 10.16x15.24 centimeter (4x6 inch) zip lock bag labeled with the drill 
hole designation and footage interval, is filled from the third sample point. This material is retained for 
possible petrographic work. All samples are transported on a daily basis to a secured area behind a locked 
gate where they are stored. Samples designated for analysis are picked up by Inspectorate Laboratory 
personnel or transported by HDG personnel to the Inspectorate sample preparation laboratory facility in 
Elko, Nevada. No sample preparation was conducted by an employee, officer, director, or associate of 
HDG.  

Scott Tregaskis, Project Manager or Randall Moore, Executive Vice President of Exploration - North 
American for TriMetals, organized sampling procedures and supervised the labeling and cataloging of all 
the samples.   

10.2 CORE DRILLING 
HDG completed 2 core holes in 2011. The holes were drilled by West-Core Drilling and they provided HDG 
with oriented core. The core had a top mark provided by the drill crews. Core was collected in a split tube 
to reduce breakage and to provide the drillers the ability to remove the core without rotation. Core was 
then placed in boxes by the drill crews. Boxes were labeled by drill hole number, box number and 
footage. Boxes were collected at the drill site by HDG geologists and transported to a secure area behind 
locked gates. Core was logged by HDG geologists who determined sampling intervals. Intervals were 
marked in the boxes and noted on the drill logs. The core was split in half by HDG employees by either a 
rock saw or a mechanical splitter. Half the core was returned to the box taking care to keep the proper 
alignment and location for the pieces. Half of each sample interval was placed in numbered bags for 
analysis. These bags were stored in a secure area behind locked gates and later transported to the 
Inspectorate laboratory facility in Sparks, Nevada by HDG employees. 

One core hole was drilled on the Thor target and a second core hole was drilled as a twin to RC hole J-10-
04 on the Jumbo target with the purpose of testing variations in grade between the two drilling methods.

11.0   SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES 
AND SECURITY 

All reverse circulation "RC" samples were collected by, or under the direct supervision of, a HDG 
geologist.  Emphasis was placed on quality control and the proper handling and numbering of all samples. 
The reverse circulation drill cuttings are collected as they come out of the drill hole from an industry 
standard rotary wet splitter provided by the drilling company, which delivers the material to three 
collection points. Samples are collected on 1.52 metre (5 foot) intervals. Material from the first collection 
point is designated for transport to Inspectorate Laboratories, located in Sparks, Nevada, USA for 
analysis. The material from the second sample point is retained as a duplicate sample for future testing if 
needed. The material from the third sample point is geologically logged onsite and put into chip trays 
which are labeled with sample numbers and footage intervals from which the sample was taken. In 
addition to the chip trays a 10.16x15.24 centimeter (4x6 inch) zip lock bag labeled with the drill hole 
designation and footage interval, is filled from the third sample point. This material is retained for 
possible petrographic work. All samples are transported on a daily basis to a secured area behind a locked 
gate where they are stored. Samples designated for analysis are picked up by Inspectorate Laboratory 
personnel, transported by HDG personnel, or shipped via a commercial carrier from the site to the 
laboratory. No sample preparation was conducted by an employee, officer, director, or associate of HDG.  

Under controlled laboratory conditions, the samples were crushed, split, ground and analyzed for gold 
using an industry standard 30 gram fire assay charge, with an atomic absorption (A.A.) or gravimetric 
finish and trace element geochemistry was performed using standard Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic 
Emission Spectrometry ("ICP-AES") methods beginning with a four- acid, near-total digestion of the 
sample matrix.  All samples with geochemical content greater than the detection limits for ICP 
methodology were re-analyzed using standard assay methods. Initial analytical results were checked by 
re-analysis of suites of both drill samples and rock chip samples.  These facilities are ISO 9001:2000 
certified laboratories.  

The laboratory inserts a total of 8% blank and standard samples into each analyzed sample batch to 
ensure precision and accuracy.  Both types of check analyses showed very consistent results with 
variations of less than +/- 2%.  HDG also inserted standards and blanks with the drill samples to 
independently provide confidence in the core sample geochemical results from Inspectorate Laboratory. 
Standard and blank samples were inserted at a rate of 10% for holes J-12-001 through J-12-009, SM-12-
001 through SM-12-005, GE-12-001 through GE-12-003 and at a rate of 5% for J-12-006 through J-12-009 
and GE-12-004 through GE-12-021 as well as for all of the 2013 drilling. The HDG standards and blanks 
were submitted to the laboratory as part of the numbered drill sample sequence and were randomized 
so no patterns developed. They were analyzed in the sequence order they were received in by the lab 
and were used to check for discrepancies in analysis. When analytical results were received, they were

Page 93 of 167 

checked against their geological context and, subsequently, the field locations and sample descriptions 
were cross-referenced with the results and sample numbers to ensure accuracy. 

Independent standard and blank material inserted by HDG was purchased from Minerals Exploration and 
Environmental Geochemistry (MEG) of Reno, Nevada. MEG is an independent sample preparation 
laboratory with a focus on providing standard reference materials (SRM) to the mining and 
environmental industries 

11.1 QA/QC RESULTS 
For the 2013 RC drill program, the QA/QC program included the insertion of blanks and gold reference 
material samples purchased from MEG and included the blank MEG-10.01, 11.13, 11.19, 12.25, and 
13.01. During the 2013 RC drill program, standard samples totaled 225. Figure 11-1 through Figure 11-6 
below show the results of the gold certified reference material used in the 2013 RC drilling. The analysis 
of the reference samples returned gold values within the acceptable limits and no significant accuracy 
issues were noted. The results of the QA/QC programs indicate there are no significant issues with the 
drill assay data. The data verification programs undertaken on the data collected from the Property 
during 2013 support the geological interpretations, and the analytical and database quality, and therefore 
are considered reliable to support the mineral resource estimation.

12.0   DATA VERIFICATION 
All geological data has been reviewed and verified by Kurt Katsura as being accurate to the extent 
possible and to the extent possible all geologic information was reviewed and confirmed. The Authors 
have relied on technical reports, data prepared by geologists employed by High Desert Gold Corporation 
and selective check sampling conducted by Kurt Katsura, a consulting geologist independent of TMI, 
during site visits in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. 

The geochemistry data from the HDG drilling was compiled by HDG into a comprehensive database.  This 
database was checked against approximately 10% of the data reported in the original assay certificates 
from Labs for accuracy by the Authors.   This review verified that the database information is accurate, 
and that no discrepancies between the assay certificates and the data base were detected. 

The Authors feel that the assay sampling and consistent QA/QC work conducted by HDG provides 
adequate and good verification of the data. 

12.1 KATSURA'S CHECK SAMPLING 
During site visits in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 Kurt Katsura, a Registered Member of the Society for 
Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration (SME), and a consulting geologist independent of TMI, collected 
representative samples from the splits of drill cuttings that are stored in Cedar City by HDG.  A split of 
these samples were collected by Mr. Katsura and sent to Inspectorate Labs in Reno, Nevada for analysis 
and checked against the samples collected by HDG.  The results of this check sampling are shown below

in Table 12-1, Table 12-2, and Table 12-3.  In 2011, Mr. Katsura also collected two rock chip samples from 
locations in the field where HDG and others had previously sampled.  These samples were also submitted 
in December 2011 to Inspectorate Labs in Reno, Nevada by Mr. Katsura for analysis. The same process 
was followed in 2012.  Sample KK-11-39 was a 2 metre chip sample across the Thor vein where it remains 
in a caved stope, as shown in Figure 7-12, and was the same location and interval that was sampled by 
Cambior in 1997.   In 2013, samples were selected from splits of drill samples that HDG has stored in their 
Cedar City facility. 

Each of the samples were collected and bagged by or supervised by Mr. Katsura and directly labeled for 
submittal to the lab.  The samples were selected by Mr. Katsura with the intent of testing a 
representative sample of the mineralized intervals, and these results are shown in the Table 12-1, Table 
12-2 and Table 12-3 below with the corresponding data that was reported by HDG for each check sample.  
The intent of Mr. Katsura's sampling was to duplicate the same type of sample taken by HDG and to 
provide independent verification of the results.  Mr. Katsura ensured that, to the extent possible, each 
sample was collected and prepared to be representative for the drill interval and sample.

The results of the sampling by Mr. Katsura confirm the presence of gold mineralization and in the relative 
value ranges that have been reported by HDG.  Although there are some variations in the geochemical 
data for the check samples, this was considered by the Authors as being within an acceptable range 
considering that the samples taken were not exactly identical to the original HDG samples from drilling 
and sample sites. 

The sampling conducted by HDG has suggested that there is a potential for a "nugget effect" and the 
variability noted in the samples reported above is considered within reason by the Authors.  This effect 
is particularly evident where visible gold grains are observed in some of the high-grade samples and in 
panned concentrates, as shown in Figure 12-1, above.  Mr. Katsura's 2013 check sampling showed very 
good correlations with the HDG results as shown above in Table 12-3 with three of Mr. Katsura's 
samples that showed moderate variation from the HDG results, however, given the possibility of the 
"nugget" effect in sampling, this was not considered by the Authors to be significant. 

13.0   MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 

In 2012 High Desert Gold Corporation conducted a series of metallurgical tests designed to assess the 
recoverability of gold by bottle roll testing using cyanidation. These tests were also conducted to assess 
the possible variation of gold grades due to the presence of coarse gold. These tests were conducted on 
47 samples collected from the RC chips from the 2012 drill program at the Grey Eagle and Jumbo targets 
and the trench at the Grey Eagle target. All samples had previously been analyzed by fire assay.  

These metallurgical tests used a sample size of 1 kilogram instead of the 30 gram sample size used for the 
previous fire assays on the original drill chips. The average cyanide recovery for all gold samples tested 
was 92% (79%-98%) and the overall gold grades calculated from the cyanide recoveries increased by an 
average of 15% over the original fire assays for values >0.2 g/t gold. Gold grades ranged from 0.043 g/t to 
13.056 g/t in the original results providing a broad range of values for the test work. Samples in this test 
came from drill holes GE-12-001, GE-12-002, J-12-004 and J-12-005 as well as the Grey Eagle trench.  

The one kilogram samples were ground to a powder (85% <200 mesh) then subjected to cyanidation for 
72 hours, with gold assays taken at 24, 48 and 72 hours. The residue or tail was also assayed. The vast 
majority of the gold was recovered in the first 24 hours with only an additional 3% of the gold being 
recovered between 24 and 48 hours and little additional recovery between 48 and 72 hours, indicating 
rapid availability of the gold at the 200 mesh grain size. Recoveries were very uniform with only a slight 
increase in recovery with grade. Low grade material between 0.048 g/t and 0.2 g/t gold had an average 
recovery of 87% whereas material grading 0.2 g/t to 13 g/t had an average recovery of 93%. 

In 2013 HDG conducted further metallurgical tests. These tests were conducted on 7 samples collected 
from the RC (reverse circulation) chips from the 2012 drill program at the Grey Eagle and Jumbo targets 
at Gold Springs in Nevada and Utah. Tests were carried out on RC chips rather than pulverized material 
as had been used in previous metallurgical tests. 

Five kilogram samples were subjected to cyanidation bottle roll testing using agitation for one minute 
every hour for 40 days. Six samples gave consistent results and are reported here. The average gold 
extraction in the Grey Eagle target (Nevada) was 78.8% (range: 74%-83%) for fine to medium grained

material (P80 0.07 to 0.24 inches) and 88.5% (range: 88%-89%) for Jumbo (Utah) (P80 0.03 to 0.14 inches). 
Gold grades for test samples ranged between 0.15 g/t and 5.3 g/t.  

Silver extractions for the same samples were much more variable and lower as was expected from 
previous work. There is a significant difference in silver extraction between Grey Eagle and Jumbo with 
much higher extractions coming from Jumbo. The average silver extraction from Grey Eagle was 19% 
and from Jumbo was 53.5%. Further testing will be needed to determine why these are different. Tests 
on these same samples using pulverized material (P80 of 0.075mm) gave extractions in the range of 10%-
60% for Grey Eagle and 71%-99% for Jumbo.  

Samples in this latest test series came from the same drill holes, GE-12-001, GE-12-002, J-12-004 and J-
12-005, as used in the prior tests. 

The high gold extractions on this coarser material suggest that the gold mineralization is amenable to 
the heap leach process. 

14.0   MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
The mineral resource reported for the Gold Springs project was completed by Terre Lane, President of 
Lane and Associates, a NI 43-101 Qualified Person. 

14.1 DEFINITIONS 
Mineral resources stated for the Gold Springs project conform to the definitions adopted by the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM), November 27, 2010, and meet criteria of 
those definitions, where: 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid 
inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and 
precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and 
quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a 
Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence 
and knowledge. 

A "Measured Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established 
that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate 
application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and 
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed 
and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade 
continuity. 

An "Indicated Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a 
level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic

Page 103 of 167 

viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and 
testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for 
geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

An "Inferred Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity 
and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 
sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The 
estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 

14.2 DATA USED FOR THE GOLD GRADE 
ESTIMATION 

Lane & Associates created two 3-dimensional block models for estimating mineral resources of the Grey 
Eagle and Jumbo mineralized zones of the Gold Springs project from data provided by HDG, and verified 
by Kurt Katsura. Data provided included drill hole data for 193 drill holes and trenches, collar 
coordinates, drill hole direction (azimuth and dip), lithology, and sampling and assay data.  Topography 
was derived from a 5-meter USGS digital elevation model.  The assay data included hole ID, gold in parts 
per billion (ppb), silver in parts per million (ppm), plus results for 30 and 50 element geochemical 
analysis. 

HDG also provided 3-dimensional geologically interpreted wireframes of the mineralized bodies in 
electronic format which was verified by the authors.  The wireframe was created from geologic cross 
sections created under Kurt Katsura's direction.  Mr. Katsura verified the wireframes.  The wireframes 
were created to isolate the stockwork and disseminated mineralization of the deposit that fall between 
the two interpreted faults, from non-mineralized rocks.  The wireframe includes lithological contacts 
between tuff and structural controls like interpreted faults which are believed to offset the 
mineralization.  Contiguous higher grade veins were not identified and were not modeled. Block models 
were tagged with wireframe geometry.  The authors recommend HDG conduct core drilling in the next 
drill program to help with understanding of geologic controls and vein system geometry, to gather 
specific gravity data, and for use in metallurgical test work. 

HDG drilled in numerous areas, but this Technical Report is focused on two of those areas:  Grey Eagle 
and Jumbo.  To date, HDG has completed 88 exploration holes and trenches in the Grey Eagle deposit 
totaling 11,123.09 meters, and 76 exploration holes and trenches in the Jumbo deposit totaling 9,235 
meters.  Figure 14-1 and Figure 14-2 show the drill hole and deposit locations for Grey Eagle and Jumbo, 
respectively.  The Grey Eagle drill holes are up to 262 meters deep, and all are within the block model 
limits.  Drill holes in the Jumbo deposit are up to 233 meters deep, and all are within the block model 
limits.  Recent drill hole collar locations were surveyed by Platt & Platt Inc., professional surveyors, using 
Trimble surveying instrumentation.  Historic drill hole collar locations were surveyed in a similar manner.  
For the modeling, Lane and Associates adjusted the drill hole collar elevations to align with (drape on) 
the digital elevation model. 

Data provided includes drill hole azimuth and dip.  No downhole surveys were conducted. The authors 
recommend HDG conduct down hole surveys in future drill programs.

14.3 METHODOLOGY 
Lane and Associates generated quantitative resource estimates for the Grey Eagle and Jumbo deposits, 
by applying geostatistical analysis of assay data to determine estimation parameters (Table 14-1), which 
were then used to estimate gold and silver grades into the 3-dimensional (3D) block model.  Three 
algorithms were used to estimate grade for both gold and silver within each block model:  Inverse 
distance cubed (ID3) interpolation constrained by a geologic wireframe, indicator kriging (IK), and 
nearest neighbor (NN).  The results from each method were very similar, validating the estimate.  The 
Geologic Wireframe model is the preferred estimate and is reported here. 

14.3.A  CAPPING OF ASSAYS 
For the Jumbo and Grey Eagle resource estimates, the assay values were assigned a code for the deposit 
area in which they reside.  Statistics of the raw assay gold value above 5 ppb within the entire Gold 
Springs database are shown in Figure 14-3.  The cumulative frequency plot indicates a log normal 
distribution with very few outliers within the database.  Figure 14-4 shows the cumulative frequency 
plot of the Grey Eagle data, and Figure 14-5 shows the same plot for Jumbo data. A total of 10 assay 
values over 10,000 ppb occur in the data, with 5 assay values over 10,000 ppb at Grey Eagle and 4 at 
Jumbo, with one outside these two zones. The data approximates a straight line, which is consistent 
with a log-normal distribution and one population.  The data is believed to be a valid part of the data 
set, and the impact of including these high assay values uncut and including them in the composites is 
negligible to the overall resource estimate. 

The Authors consider that grade capping is not required for estimating gold and silver grades for this 
deposit as there is not a high-grade outlier population that will introduce bias.

The Gold Springs assaying was performed almost exclusively using 1.52-meter-long sample intervals and 
assayed using a 30-gram fire assay.  This small sample will have higher variability (higher and lower 
grade) than a larger open pit minable volume due to the size of the mining equipment and its ability to 
selectively mine a discrete volume. 

"Purely on the basis of the sample values, we might conclude that a large enough portion of the deposit 
is above our economic cutoff grade to warrant developing the prospect.  When we actually mine the 
deposit using [a loader and] trucks that are much larger than our original core samples, the inevitable 
averaging of high grades and low grades may result in a far lower proportion of the economic viable 
material than we originally thought" (Isaaks & Sirvastava, 1989). To estimate the grade that might be 
obtained during production, an adjustment of the grade from a small volume to a larger volume is 
required, a "change of support."  Without this change of support, the resource estimate would be 
predicting the distribution of 1.52-meter volumes within the deposit. This change of support to a larger 
volume is critical to the estimation of recoverable grade.  This larger volume should coincide with the 
selectivity of the mining method, which is limited by the bench height as grade control is performed on a 
bench by bench basis during blasting.  In surface mines, the bench height is set based on the "selectivity 
required for separating the ore and waste; the rate of production; [and] the size and type of equipment 
to meet the production requirements" (Kennedy, 1990).  A production fleet comprised of a 25 cubic yard 
(CY) (19 m3) loader matched with 137 CY (105 m3) trucks is typical of Nevada heap leach operations.  The 
selected bench height for an operation of this type should be below the maximum reach of the loader 
for safety but also allow for efficient operation and production rates.  A bench height of 5 meters 
provides for both of these requirements.  For this reason, the block model dimensions were set at 5 x 5 x 
5 meters.  A composite length of 4.5 meters is very comparable to 5 meter blocks size and would be an 
appropriate selected length if there are minimal differences between the sample and composite mean 
grade. 

The change of support, or correction for volume variance, will affect the spread and symmetry of the 
distribution but should not result in drastic changes to the mean value.  When moving from a small 
sample size to a larger volume a reduction in the spread and variability of the data set is expected.  To 
verify an appropriate change from the sample data set to the composited values, a set of summary 
statistics was performed for the metals to be estimated.  Table 14-2 below compares the sample and 
composite statistics.  As shown in the table, the spread and variability of each metal is reduced with no 
significant change in the mean value, indicating that the 4.5-meter composite length is an appropriate 
selection.

Histograms were created for the assay data and each composite interval for both gold and silver. One 
histogram from the Grey Eagle deposit is provided below as Figure 14-5, and one histogram from the 
Jumbo deposit is provided below as Figure 14-6.   

The composites were then used for the variography analysis within each deposit.

14.3.C  VARIOGRAPHY 
The spatial variability within each deposit was assessed using semi-variograms (variograms).  The 
following types of variograms were generated for both the Grey Eagle and Jumbo deposit area: 

•  "Global" omni-directional exponential variogram for both gold and silver using a "pair wise" 
organizing of the variance pairs 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 113 of 167 

• Down-hole variogram for both gold and silver 

• Variograms at azimuths of 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees, and dips of 0, 45, and 90 degrees for both 
gold and silver 

• Variograms at dips of -60, -30, 0, 30, and 60 degrees and azimuths of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 
degrees for both gold and silver 

• Variograms of the log transform of gold for azimuths of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 degrees at 
dips of -60, -30, 0, 30, and 60 degrees 

• Global, downhole, and azimuth indicator variograms for both gold and silver. 

A variogram from the Grey Eagle deposit is shown below as Figure 14-7, and a variogram from the 
Jumbo deposit is shown below as Figure 14-8. 

For purposes of IK, sill values were evaluated using global omni-directional variograms, and the nugget 
was evaluated using down-hole variograms, which best represent the inherent short-scale variability 
within the mineralized areas.  Ellipsoid axis ratios were based upon variograms created for both of the 
angles normal to the primary axis.  The primary axis length search parameter for the IK and ID3 models 
was set at 1.5 times the variogram range with a maximum of 100 meters.  A summary of the estimation 
parameters is presented in Table 14-3. 

14.3.D  SPECIFIC GRAVITY 
Lane and Associates used a specific gravity of 2.65 grams per centimeter cubed (g/cm3), which is typical 
for the rock types found in the Gold Springs area.  Specifically, typical andesite specific gravities are 2.5 
to 2.8 g/cm3, and typical quartz specific gravity is 2.65 g/cm3.  Lane and Associates recommends that the 
Company conduct density tests to confirm the density.  Visual inspection of the tuff overlying 
mineralization at Grey Eagle suggests that it will be less dense than the 2.65 g/cm3 currently used. 

Subsequent to the estimation of the resource, TriMetals collected and analyzed samples for specific 
gravity (SG).  The results are described below and shown in Table 14-4, and support the use of a value of 
2.65 g/cm3 in the resource estimation.  Samples were selected from the Grey Eagle trench and surface 
outcrop at Jumbo. The samples showed a low to moderate level of surface weathering. 

Samples were weighed in air and water using a Veritas precision balance with an accuracy of 0.1 grams. 
Sample size varied from 404 g to 821g. The results were consistent with those expected for the rock 
types with the more weathered material giving lower SG's. The average SG for the 7 samples was 2.6 
within a range of 2.05 to 2.86. If the most weathered sample J-2 (SG 2.05) is removed from the data-set, 
then the average SG is 2.7. It would be expected that subsurface unweathered material would have a 
slightly higher SG and that an average value for these types of rocks would be the best estimate to use. 
A value of 2.65 was chosen for the estimation.

14.3.E  ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY 
Separate block models were created for the Gold Springs Grey Eagle and Jumbo deposits using blocks 
dimensions of 5 meters by 5 meters by 5 meters in each.  Blocks were located relative to the DEM 
topographic elevation model. Each of the blocks was assigned fields to contain gold and silver grade for 
each estimation method, resource classification, rock density, block tonnage, and contained ounces. 

The block models have the attributes shown in Table 14-3. 

Following block model parameter estimation, each block was assigned a resource classification of 
indicated and inferred.  The classifications were assigned based on the distance from the block to the 
nearest composite sample.  The "indicated" class required a distance of less than 30.48 meters; and the 
inferred class was 30.48 meters to a distance of less than 100 meters. 

14.3.e.i   Removal of Tuff 
The Grey Eagle deposit is partially overlain by unmineralized ash flow tuff.  Model blocks located below 
the ground surface and above the base of the tuff were tagged within the block model as being part of 
the tuff strata.  Following ore grade estimation, those blocks were set to a grade of zero for both gold 
and silver in order to avoid the estimation of grade within a geologic unit that is not part of the 
mineralized zone. 

14.3.e.ii   Wireframe 
The wire frame was created from the geologic sections created under the direction of Kurt Katsura to 
limit estimation of grade to the geologically interpreted mineralized domain which is made up of 
stockwork, veins, and disseminated mineralization, and to truncate mineralization at known faults.  
Wireframes were limited to approximately 50 meters along the strike of the mineralization, or to the 
geologic contacts and interpreted faults.  The wire frames were visually checked on computer screens, 
and in cross section, long section, and plan.  The wireframes achieved their objective as evidenced by 
the Indicated Resource compared to the inferred resource.  The Indicated Resource at a 0.2 g/t cutoff 
contains 21.3 million tonnes and 339,000 oz Au (0.50 g/t) while inferred is 16.7 million tonnes 214,000 
oz Au (0.40 g/t) while the volume encompassed by the 100-meter inferred search radius is many times 
larger than the volume of the 30-meter Inferred search radius indicating the estimation of inferred 
mineralization was quickly limited by the wireframe.

TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 117 of 167 

The inverse-distance-cubed method was used to estimate gold and silver grade in all model blocks 
contained within a wireframe boundary based on geologic boundaries of the Grey Eagle and Jumbo 
mineralized bodies.  Use of the wireframe models as boundaries prevents the inverse distance cubed 
algorithm from assigning grade beyond the mapped and inferred edges of the mineralized envelope.  
For each block in the block model, the inverse distance cubed method of estimation considered 2 to 8 
samples within a search ellipsoid and calculated a weighted average of the grade.  The weight for each 
sample was equal to one over the distance from the block centroid raised to the power of three.  The 
result is that samples near the block are weighted much more heavily than samples that are farther 
away. 

14.3.e.iii   Nearest Neighbor 
Nearest neighbor estimates were performed for gold and silver in both the Grey Eagle and Jumbo block 
models.  Within a specified search ellipsoid, each block in the block model was assigned the gold and 
silver grade of the sample nearest to the block centroid. 

14.3.e.iv   Indicator Kriging 
Two-stage indicator kriging was used to estimate grade in both the Jumbo and Grey Eagle block models.  
In the first stage, all composite samples with grade for gold over 50 ppb (mineralized), or with silver over 
5 ppm were tagged as "1" while samples with lower grade were tagged as "0."  Kriging was then 
performed for both gold and silver to estimate the proportion of each block considered to be 
mineralized and the portion considered to be not mineralized of each metal.  In the second stage, 
kriging was used to estimate the gold and silver grade associated with the mineralized portion and the 
gold and silver grade associated with the non-mineralized portion of each block.  Those quantities were 
then combined to generate an estimate of the overall block grade. 

Parameters for the kriging include the nugget, sill, and range, as well as the anisotropy of the ellipsoid 
defining the spatial variability.  For Grey Eagle and Jumbo, these were determined by variogram analysis 
and by considering the expected variation based on the site geology. 

14.3.F  ESTIMATE VALIDATION 
Lane and Associates generated cross-sections, longitudinal sections, and bench plans of the deposits to 
examine the results of the modeling and confirm that the results agree with the geology.  
Representative cross-sections are provided in Figure 14-9 and Figure 14-12, representative longitudinal 
sections are provided in Figure 14-10 and Figure 14-13, and representative bench plans are provided in 
Figure 14-11 and Figure 14-14.  

The sections and plans show the block model results, including category (i.e., 2 for Indicated, or 3 for 
Inferred), estimated gold ounces, and estimated silver ounces.  Validation of the model consisted of an 
examination of the data within the blocks on the sections and plans with actual drill hole assay data to 
determine if the estimated block data fit the geologic parameters of the deposit.

Lane and Associates performed basic statistical checks on the data and the model.  Cumulative 
frequency plots of each model Indicated resources are plotted below in Figure 14-15 and Figure 14-16 
for Grey Eagle and in Figure 14-17 and Figure 14-18 for Jumbo.  

Lane and Associates compared the results of the NN model with the results of the ID3 and IK models for 
all of the blocks that received grade and found that the tons and grade showed slight differences as 
would be expected for each estimation method (see Table 14-6 and Figure 14-19).  Lane and Associates 
has chosen the ID3 geologically constrained estimate as the preferred method.

A scatter plot of individual block grades to the average distance to composite values utilized in the block 
estimate was created to confirm that large portions of the block model were not being populated by 
high grade composite values near the distance limit of the interpolation, which was set at 100 meters.  
Figure 14-20 and Figure 14-21 contain scatter plots of the individual block grades versus the average 
distance to the composite samples.  As shown in the plots, a spike in the block grades as distances to the 
composites near 100 meters is not present in either resource estimate demonstrating the spread of 
higher grade samples is well controlled.  Nearly all blocks were estimated from the maximum number of 
composites, only 90,100 tonnes containing 1,425 ounces of gold (0.49 g/t) was estimated at an average 
distance of more than 75 meters, with the minimum number of composites (2) at a 0.20 g/t cutoff, 
within the wireframe ID3 model. 

14.4 DILUTION 
Lane and Associates believes wireframe resource estimate is adequately diluted, reflecting grades that 
could be obtained by bulk tonnage open pit mining methods. 

14.5 CUTOFF GRADE 
Lane and Associates calculated the cutoff grade as follows: 

Typical open pit heap leach operating costs: 
 Mining  $1.50/tonne 
 Process  $3.00/tonne 
 G&A  $0.50/tonne 
 Total  $5.00/tonne 
 
With 70% recovery, the cost is $7.14/tonne contained, and with a metal price of $1,300/ounce (oz), the 

calculated cutoff grade is 
$7.14/tonne

$1,300/oz

Lane and Associates rounded the calculated cutoff grade to the nearest 0.1 g/tonne, resulting in a final 
cutoff grade of 0.20 g/tonne.  The cutoff grade is shown in boldface in Tables 14-5 through 14-7 below.

14.6 MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
Lane and Associates believes that the drilling has created enough sample support and the models show 
enough continuity of mineralization to warrant the classification of an Indicated and Inferred resource 
according to the definition adopted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum

(CIM), November 27, 2010.  Indicated Resources occur within 30.48 meters of a drill hole, which is less 
than half of the variogram range, with inferred mineralization outside 30.48 meters. 

14.7 MINERAL RESOURCE TABULATION 
The mineral resource estimate is summarized below in Table 14-5, Table 14-6, and Table 14-7 (Gold 
equivalent (AuEq) calculations reflect gross metal content using the gold/silver ratio of 57.14, and have 
not been adjusted for metallurgical recoveries).  This resource estimation includes all drill data obtained 
as of January, 2014, and estimated by Lane and Associates in February, 2014.

14.8 MINE MODELING 
Lane and Associates performed mine pit modeling as a precursor to mine scheduling, cost estimation, 
and economic modeling.  Using the block models developed for resource estimation, L&A set up the 
Techbase OPCONE floating cone miner to calculate the maximum extent of open pit mining that would 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 134 of 167 

be potentially mineable at various gold prices.  Pit shell 4, which was dug at a gold price of $1,000/ounce 
and a silver price of $17.50/ounce and after economic analysis was determined to be most robust at 
various gold prices, was selected for this study.  Mining and processing costs were fixed at $1.50/tonne 
for mining, $3.00/tonne for processing, and $0.50/tonne for General and Administrative (G&A).  A 45-
degree pit slope angle was specified to accommodate haul roads; the pits were not designed with haul 
roads. 

The floating cone miner determined the potential economics of mining each mineralized block within 
the block model, mining the potentially mineable blocks and continuing to enlarge the pit until no 
potentially mineable blocks remained.  The model evaluates the economics of mining a block by 
considering several factors, including: 

• The amount of waste rock that would have to be mined within the cone above the block in 
order to mine the mineralized block.  

• The value of the gold and silver within the mineralized block.  The value is based on the amount 
of the mineral present in the block times the price of the mineral times process recovery for the 
mineral. 

• The net revenue generated by a block, which is calculated as either the mining cost or the block 
revenue minus the cost to mine and process the block, whichever is greater.  G&A is included in 
in the cost to mine and process the block.  An incremental cutoff (i.e., a determination of 
leachable material vs. waste, not including the mining cost) once rock has been mined was not 
used. 

The quantities of leachable material, waste rock, gold, and silver mined were reported out of the model.  
Drawings of the pit contours were generated and overlain on the current ground topography.  The pit 
contour maps are presented in Figure 14-22, below. 

Results of the mine pit modeling are summarized in Table 14-10:  , based on varying cutoffs and 
categories of indicated and inferred.  All results are based on the inverse distance cubed resource 
estimate constrained by geologic wireframe.  In general, increasing the cutoff value decreases the 
tonnage reported and improves the grade slightly.  For purposes of reporting model pit tonnages, gold 
and silver grades, and indicated and inferred categories, a range of  cutoff values are reported:  0.15 
g/tonne, 0.2 g/tonne, and 0.25 g/tonne.

15.0   MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
"Mineral reserves" differ from "Mineral Resources" in that mineral reserves are known to be 
economically feasible for extraction.  The Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) 
Definition Standards require the completion of a Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS) as the minimum 
prerequisite for the conversion of Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves.  At this time, a PFS has not 
been completed for the Gold Springs project.  Therefore, reserve estimates have not been made.

16.0   MINING METHODS 
The Gold Springs deposit is a near surface epithermal gold system most suitable for open pit mining and 
heap leach gold recovery. L&A have used that approach for economic analysis.  

16.1 MINE SCHEDULING 
The resources were reported by bench showing leachable material, waste, and tuff1 tonnes, and ounces 
of gold and silver.  Codes distinguishing indicated and inferred resources were reported but not used 
separately for this study.  That is, all leachable material, whether indicated or inferred, was treated 
equally for purposes of this PEA. 

Readers are advised that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 
economic viability under National Instrument 43-101.  This PEA is preliminary in nature and includes 
inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 
considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves under 
National Instrument 43-101.  Readers are advised that there is no certainty that the results projected in 
this preliminary economic assessment will be realized. 

Table 16-1 presents a summary of the model pit developed in Section 14.  The gold cutoff grade in Table 
16-1 was calculated using the gold price under which the pit shell was modeled and the formula 
presented in Section 14.6, i.e.:

A spreadsheet was created to generate a preliminary mining schedule.  The production rate for 
leachable material was the schedule-determining factor.  The assigned average production rate was 
determined from the total leachable tonnage in each pit, with the intent of creating a target project life 
of 8-10 years.  A production rate of 10,000 tonnes per day of leach material was selected for the owner-
operated and contractor mining scenarios presented here.  The quantities of leachable material mined 
on each bench during each year of production, assuming 365 productive days, were scheduled.  The 
quantities of mined waste and tuff were set proportionate to the ore mining rate (i.e., if 100% of the 
leachable material on a bench was mined, 100% of the waste and tuff were also mined; if 50% of the 
leachable material on a bench was mined, 50% of the waste and tuff were also mined).  This approach 
works well for an initial study; however, more detailed scheduling with some phasing and pre-stripping 
will smooth out the production, resulting in better equipment utilization and slightly lower mining costs. 

The mining schedule is summarized below in Table 16-2.  Grey Eagle was mined first, followed 
immediately by Jumbo.  Mining Grey Eagle first optimized the project economics because the leachable 
material at Grey Eagle has higher grade, on average, than the leachable material at Jumbo.  

16.1  MINE OPERATION AND LAYOUT 
The Grey Eagle and Jumbo areas will each have a location for crushing and grinding, a dedicated leach 
pad, a Merrill-Crowe plant location, and a waste dump.  Initially, leachable material from Grey Eagle will 
be trucked from the Grey Eagle pit to the crushing and grinding area near Grey Eagle, while Grey Eagle 
waste rock and tuff will be trucked to the Grey Eagle waste dump.  After size reduction, Grey Eagle 
leachable material will be transported to the Grey Eagle leach pad by conveyor, where it will undergo 
cyanide leaching, followed by gold recovery by the Merrill-Crowe process.  When mining at the Grey 
Eagle pit is complete and crushing and grinding of Grey Eagle leachable material are complete, the skid-
mounted crushing and grinding equipment will be mobilized and set up at Jumbo.  Leachable material 
from Jumbo would be put under leach while the leaching of the last Grey Eagle leaching is completed.  
This will prevent a shortfall in metal production.  Once the last Grey Eagle leach is completed (about 2-3 
months after mining ends) and the gold and silver are recovered, the skid-mounted Merrill-Crowe plant 
and precipitate filter would be moved to Jumbo where the leaching and recovery of gold and silver from 
Jumbo will proceed.  The office, warehouse, and furnace facility used for final casting of ingots and 
buttons will be constructed at Grey Eagle and will remain at Grey Eagle after the other facilities are 
relocated to Jumbo.  Precipitate from the Merrill-Crowe plant at Jumbo would be transported to Grey 
Eagle for smelting and refining. 

L&A developed conceptual layouts for the deposit areas, including waste dump locations and sizes, 
leach pad locations and sizes, pond locations and sizes, processing facility locations, access road routes, 
and overhead power line routes.  Figure 16-1, below, illustrates the conceptual Gold Springs project 
layout with pits, pads, and dumps.

16.1  MINE PRODUCTIVITY 
L&A calculated mine productivity to determine the sizes and numbers of trucks and loaders that would 
be required for each case.  A simplified approach to cycle calculations was used; it considered 
productivity variables such as average annual production of leachable material and waste, average truck 
haul distance and travel speed, hours per shift and shifts per day, availability variables such as breaks 
during the day, and truck and loader/shovel capacities.  Hourly production rates and truck and loader 
wait times were calculated in order to optimize the design.   

Productivity calculations are summarized below in Table 16-3.

17.0   RECOVERY METHODS 
The leachable material from Gold Springs will be crushed in two stages to produce a product with P100 
of one inch.  A schematic of the crushing operation is provided in Figure 17-1. 

Figure 17-1: Schematic of Crushing and Leaching 

 

The crushed material will be transported by conveyor from the crusher to the heap leach pads, where it 
will be stacked into a "heap" on an impermeable pad and irrigated for an extended period of time with 
an alkaline sodium cyanide solution to dissolve the gold and silver.  The leachate ("pregnant solution") 
will be collected as it percolates out from the base of the heap and be piped into the pregnant solution 
pond.  The pregnant solution will then undergo processing in a Merrill-Crowe gold and silver recovery 
circuit.  The Merrill-Crowe system removes precious metals from a cyanide solution by zinc 
precipitation.  Merrill-Crowe is appropriate for high silver-bearing gold ores where the pregnant solution 
has a ratio of more than 5:1 silver to gold. Gold Springs is expected to average about 12:1.  The Merrill-
Crowe system will include clarification filters, de-aeration towers, vacuum pumps, a zinc dust feeder, 
lead nitrate feeders, precipitate filter feed pumps, filter pre-coat systems, and precipitate filters.  The 
filter cake is refined and smelted to produce doré, a gold-silver mixture that can be cast into ingots.  A 
schematic of a typical Merrill-Crowe system is provided in Figure 17-2.

18.0   PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
Currently, the project site has no electricity, one small water well, and low-quality gravel access roads. 
The project will require a power line which for the purposes of this PEA comes from a substation located 
approximately 25 miles from the site, additional upgrades to the access roads, and at least one 
additional water well. As discussed above, L&A developed conceptual layouts for the deposit areas, 
including waste dump locations and sizes, leach pad locations and sizes, pond locations and sizes, 
processing facility locations, access road routes, and overhead power line routes. An office, dry, 
warehouse, truck shop, guard house, substation and fuel tank are included in the estimate.  A general 
site layout was provided earlier as Figure 16-1. 

19.0   MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
The Gold Springs project will produce doré (gold-silver alloy) bars.  A long-established, active, worldwide 
market exists for the buying and selling of gold and silver.  TMI expects this to continue throughout the 
life of the Gold Springs project.  Further market studies are not deemed necessary to establish the 
existence of a market for the product.

20.0   ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, 
PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

The Company is operating its exploration program under a Plan of Operations (PoO) in Nevada and is in 
the process of completing a Plan of Operations in Utah. Under the PoO the Company was required to 
complete an Environmental Assessment (EA) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) determined 
that there was no significant impact from the PoO.  The Company has completed cultural and biological 
surveys over large portions of the project area as part of the EA. On March 27, 2014, the Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM) Caliente Office of Nevada issued a Record of Decision (RD) and a Finding of No 
Significant Impact (FONSI) for TriMetal's Environmental Assessment (EA) covering exploration on the 
Nevada portion of the Gold Springs project. The acceptance of the Environmental Assessment means 
that the Company is free to begin the work proposed in its Plan of Operations, which outlines staged 
exploration activities for possible resource expansion. 

Prior to mining activities the project will require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that will 
include investigation of the impacts of the project on flora, fauna, and community.  The EIS process is 
expected to take two to three years, including the collection of data, preparation of the document, 
agency review, and public comment and review. 

The EIS will determine requirements and final design of leach facilities, waste dumps, and mine closure. 

The water table is well below current pit bottom elevations, so pit lake issues are not anticipated.

Both Nevada and Utah have a long history of mining and derive a significant portion of their revenue 
from the mining industry.  The primary social and community impacts that are expected to occur with 
full scale development of the Gold Springs property relate to the creation of jobs and tax revenue in the 
surrounding area, particularly affecting Lincoln County, NV and Iron County, UT. Based on the 
manpower estimates in Table 21-7, the number of jobs directly created could be about 92.  Additional 
jobs would be created indirectly in the surrounding communities.  Along with increased tax revenue, 
local communities would experience an increased demand for services such as roads and schools.   

Mine closure requirements and costs have been anticipated in the costing of the project by including a 
reclamation bond in the amount of 2.7 million.  At this stage of the project, this consideration is 
considered adequate. Mine closure is anticipated to include the removal of haulage and access 
roadways, potential re-contouring and seeding of waste dumps, removal, re-grading, and seeding of all 
process facilities, shops, offices, and warehouse. 

21.0   CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
21.1 CAPITAL COSTS 

21.1.A  QUANTITIES 
21.1.a.i   Mining Equipment 

One crawler-mount blast hole drill is required to achieve the production rate of10,000 tpd of ore.  Waste 
load and haul cycle calculations show one 19-cubic meter loader and four 150 -tonne trucks are needed 
as haul distances are very short.  The fleet also includes a D10-11 size dozer to rip the relatively soft tuff 
overlying mineralization at Grey Eagle, and 631-sized scrapers to move broken tuff to the waste dump.  
This combination will likely have very high productivity. A mid-range value of 900 bank cubic meters per 
hour was used.  Sonic velocity tests should be done on the tuff to more accurately determine ripper 
productivity.  Generally, a single large jaw crusher and two cone crushers were proposed to reduce 
leach material to minus 1-inch.  The estimate also includes support equipment that will be needed at the 
mine, including dozers, grader, water truck, service trucks, etc. and facilities, such as a heavy equipment 
shop, a fuel station, etc.  A summary of the mining equipment requirements for each case is provided in 
Table 21-1. 

Other capital requirements included mining-related buildings.  A summary of capital item requirements 
is provided in Table 21-1 and Table 21-2.

21.1.B  CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE 
Capital costs for equipment and facilities were input to generate total annual capital costs for each item.  
L&A used the InfoMine USA, Inc. Mine and Mill Equipment Costs, An Estimator's Guide (InfoMine, 2013) 
to obtain capital costs for mining and crushing equipment.  See Table 21-6 for a capital cost summary. 

Capital costs for the Merrill-Crowe system were estimated by L&A with the assistance of Dr. Deepak 
Malhotra, PhD, QP. 

Costs for building new or improving existing roads were included in the "Mine" line item.  Working 
capital was estimated to be 2 months' operating costs.  The working capital was estimated to be 
recovered the year after production ends.  Sustaining capital was estimated as 10% of the mobile 
equipment cost per year.  Capital contingency was set at 15%. 

Owner's costs such as permitting, land, exploration, metallurgical testing, and feasibility studies were 
not included in the estimate. 

21.1  MANPOWER 
Manpower for the mine and processing facility includes hourly-rate employees and salaried employees, 
who are generally superintendents and professional personnel.  The numbers of required equipment 
operators was estimated using the quantities of equipment required, the quantity of personnel per 
piece of equipment, and the number of shifts per day.  Numbers of required processing and salaried 
personnel were estimated based on L&A's experience.  A burden factor of 34% was added to all labor.  
The burden includes fringe benefits, holidays, vacation and sick leave, insurances, etc.  A summary of the 
manpower requirements is provided in Table 21-7. 

21.1  OPERATING COST ESTIMATE 
Annual and unit operating costs for equipment and facilities were input to generate total annual 
operating costs for each item.  L&A used the InfoMine USA, Inc. Mine and Mill Equipment Costs, An 
Estimator's Guide (InfoMine, 2013) to obtain operating costs for mining equipment. 

Operating contingency was set at 10%. 

A summary of the project operating costs is provided in Table 21-8.

22.0   ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
Two production scenarios were considered.  Owner operated mining, where TMI purchases and 
operates the mine equipment fleet, and contractor mining, where an open pit mining contractor is hired 
to do the mining, reducing the capital cost of the project at the expense of increased mining costs.    

A gold price of $1,300/ounce and a silver price of $21.00/ounce were used, and the projected metal 
recovery rates were 75% for gold at both Grey Eagle and Jumbo, 25% for silver at Grey Eagle, and 45% 
for silver at Jumbo.  Operating and Capital Cost were deducted from revenue, yielding cash flow.  The 
project does not have overriding royalties. 

22.1 OWNER-OPERATED MINING 
The before tax Net Present Value (NPV) at a discount rate of 5% and 10% and before tax internal rate of 
return (IRR) were calculated and summarized in Table 22-1 below.

NPV – Net Present Value 
IRR – internal rate of return 
 
The economic model indicates favorable NPV at a 5% discount rate of $150 million with an IRR of 
39.66% before tax, at a gold price of $1,300/ounce and silver price of $21/ounce. 

22.2 CONTRACT MINING 
The contract mining scenario reduces the capital cost of the project as the open-pit mining contractor 
provides its equipment to the project; therefore, for the contract mining scenario, all mining equipment 
capital costs and associated labor costs are removed from the cost estimate.  The mining operating 
costs, however, increase, reflecting contractor equipment ownership costs and profit.  L&A estimates 
mining costs will increase by about 20%. The resulting changes to capital and operating costs, NPV, and 
IRR are shown in Table 22-2. 

Summary data for gold and silver ounces, operating cost per ounce of gold recovered, and total cost per 
ounce of gold recovered for the contractor mining option are provided in Table 22-3. 

The economic model again indicates favorable before tax NPV at a 5% discount rate of $162 million and 
an IRR of 57.51% before tax.

Income tax of 25% were factored into the economic analysis.  Straight line depreciation of Capital Costs 
was also used in the economic analysis tax calculation.  The after tax NPV at a 5% discount rate and IRR 
for owner-operated are $98 million and 29%; the after tax NPV at a 10% discount rate for owner –
operated is $62 million.  The after tax NPV at a 5% discount rate and IRR for contractor mining are $109 
million and 42%; the after tax NPV at a 10% discount rate for contractor mining is $75 million.  
Approximately $68 million and $70 are paid in State and Federal taxes in the owner-operated and the 
contractor mining scenarios respectively. 

The tax calculation should be considered conservative, without consideration for exploration costs 
incurred, corporate tax philosophy, losses carried forward, and other factors. 

22.4 GOLD PRICE SENSITIVITY 
L&A evaluated the before tax NPV5% and IRR sensitivity of each case to gold price for the owner-
operated mining and contract mining scenario.  The results are shown in Table 22-4, Table 22-5, Table 
22-6, andTable 22-7.

The results in Table 22-7 indicate that contractor mining has the highest return at a $1000 gold price and 
provides a consistent return at higher gold prices and is therefore the most robust of the cases. 
Additional work in scheduling and optimization of cutoff grade would likely improve these results.

22.5 BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS 
L&A looked at the project breakeven gold price to further evaluate project economics.  For contractor 
mining, the project breakeven gold price (defined as 0% IRR) is approximately $651. 

Once the project is in operation, the breakeven gold price is defined as the price that results in zero net 
revenue (before taxes).  Because the mineral revenues, operating costs, and capital costs will vary with 
each year of operation, the operational breakeven gold price will also vary with each year of operation.  
For contractor mining, the operational breakeven gold prices (defined as $0 before tax cash flow) are 
approximately $940, $495, $360, $630, $420, $485, $430, $405, and $670 for each successive year of 
operation. 

22.6 CONCLUSIONS OF ECONOMIC MODEL 
The project economics shown in this scoping study are favorable, with contractor mining appearing to 
be the most robust at varying gold prices. 

23.0   ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
Pilot Gold has mining claims and properties approximately 6 kilometres to the northeast in the Stateline 
District in Utah, where they are actively exploring outside the Gold Springs Property area. 

24.0   OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND 
INFORMATION 

Section 27, References, provides a list of documents that were consulted in support of the PEA.  No 
further data or information is necessary, in the opinion of the Authors, to make the PEA understandable 
and not misleading. 

25.0   INTERPRETATION AND 
CONCLUSIONS 

The Gold Springs project, located in western Iron County, Utah and eastern Lincoln County, Nevada and 
consists of 963 unpatented lode claims 13 patented lode claims, and four state of Utah leases covering 
approximately 7,568 ha. Gold mineralization at the Gold Springs project is characterized by large through-
going veins, complex sheeted veins, breccias and stockwork vein systems that are laterally extensive and 
locally form resistant ledges and ribs that protrude up to 10 metres above the surrounding ground 
surface.  The veins contain quartz, adularia, bladed calcite, minor fluorite, and minor sulfides (<2%) and 
represent low sulfidation, epithermal gold-silver vein systems.  Trace element geochemistry for As 
(arsenic) and Sb (antimony) show relatively low values compared to  other similar quartz-adularia 
epithermal vein systems such as the K-2 deposit in Washington and the Midas deposit in northern 
Nevada (Leavitt et al., 2004; Simmons et al., 2005). This is especially true for the Grey Eagle system which

TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 157 of 167 

reflects an alkalic, low-sulfidation, hydrothermal system with magnetite alteration to hematite, stable 
Kspar-biotite-hornblende, high calcite, trace fluorite environment.  The Jumbo-Etna system reflects an 
early calc-alkaline, intermediate sulfidation hydrothermal system with quartz-sericite (illite)-pyrite 
alteration with weakly anomalous arsenic and antimony being overprinted with an alkalic, low-sulfidation 
system which formed the strong quartz-adularia-calcite-bladed quartz after calcite vein stockwork, 
sheeted veins and hydrothermal breccias.  

Vein systems in the Gold Springs district generally strike north-south but vary in orientation from 
northeast to northwest. This is observed in the Grey Eagle target area where several syn-post-mineral 
structural trends displace and locally offset the main N-S trending, westerly dipping vein zone.  The early 
vein bearing structures probably formed in response to the emplacement and subsequent collapse of the 
Gold Springs dome-caldera (20-17 ma).  HDG completed rock chip sampling, preliminary mapping, soil 
sampling, stream sediment sampling, and in 2011 a property-wide aero-magnetic and ZTEM geophysical 
survey was completed. This work has identified 18 targets located within lands controlled by HDG. Drill 
results from the HDG programs and from previous operators suggests that many of these targets will 
produce positive drill results which could define new resource areas. The combination of surface 
geochemical sampling and drilling results completed on the project to date shows the potential for 
significant gold mineralization in the Gold Springs project area as narrow high-grade veins (>3.0 g/t gold) 
and areas of broad lower-grade mineralization (<1.0 g/t gold).  

The resource in this report includes an indicated and inferred category. The base case Indicated resource 
is 21,289,000 tonnes @ 0.5 g/t Au and 9.8 g/t Ag for a contained 339,000 troy ounces gold and 6,687,000 
troy ounces silver plus an inferred base case resource of 16,674,000 tonnes @ 0.4 g/t Au and 9.1 g/t Ag 
for an additional 214,000 troy ounces gold and 4,857,000 troy ounces silver using a 0.2 g/t Au cutoff. This 
equates to a base case Indicated resource of 456,000 ounces AuEq averaging 0.67g/t AuEq and an 
additional 299,000 ounces AuEq @0.56 g/t AuEq in the Inferred category. Gold equivalent (AuEq) 
calculations reflect gross metal content using the gold/silver ratio of 57.14, and have not been adjusted 
for metallurgical recoveries. Numbers have been rounded. This mineralization remains open along strike 
and at depth within the Jumbo and Grey Eagle target areas. Readers are advised that mineral resources 
that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability under National Instrument 
43-101.  

There are a variety in the styles of mineralization which include disseminated and stockwork controlled 
bulk targets, high-grade underground targets, tuff-hosted sheeted vein and disseminated bulk targets, 
and pipe-like features hosted within intra-caldera tuffs and rhyolites.  The geologic setting is positive for 
discovery and the number of high-grade gold samples and the wide spread distribution across the project 
area suggests that there is a good possibility for additional discoveries.  

For purposes of costing and economic modeling, L&A considered seven basic mine pit models driven by a 
range of gold prices and cutoff grades.  Subsequent cost modeling and economic analyses examined each 
of the seven pit models over a range of conditions. The most robust pit shell at varying gold prices was 
selected for this Study.  The analysis assumes a heap leach process with a Merrill-Crowe plant to recover 
gold and silver.   

Under the owner-operated scenario, the economic model estimated capital costs were $85.6 million and 
operating costs were $7.58 per tonne of leachable material.  At a gold price of $1300, before tax net

Page 158 of 167 

Present Value (NPV) at a 5% discount rate was $150 million, with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 
39.66%. 

Contractor mining economics improved slightly.  Capital costs decreased by about 30% because the 
contractor would supply the fleet of mining equipment.  Total operating costs per tonne of leachable 
material were about 7.5% higher for contractor mining at$8.16 per tonne of leachable material.  Before 
tax NPV5% values at a $1300 gold price for contractor mining was $162 million with an IRR of 57.51%. 

The project economics shown in this PEA are favorable, with both owner-operated mining and 
contractor mining.   

Utah State Corporate Income tax and Nevada Net Proceeds of Minerals tax, both 5%, and Federal 
Income tax of 25% were factored into the economic analysis.  Straight line depreciation of Capital Costs 
was also used in the economic analysis tax calculation.  The after tax NPV at a 5% discount rate and IRR 
for owner mining are $98 million and 29%; the after tax NPV at a 10% discount rate for owner mining is 
$62 million.  The after tax NPV at a 5% discount rate and IRR for contractor mining are $109 million and 
42%; the after tax NPV at a 10% discount rate for contractor mining is $75 million.  Approximately $68 
million and $70 million are paid in State and Federal taxes owner-operated and contractor mining 
scenarios respectively. 

25.1 RISK 
This PEA is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too 
speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them 
to be categorized as mineral reserves under National Instrument 43-101.  Readers are advised that there 
is no certainty that the results projected in this preliminary economic assessment will be realized.  There 
is inherent engineering and metallurgical risk in all projects at this stage of development which are 
reduced as engineering studies, including the prefeasibility and feasibility studies, progress. This project, 
as with others, would be negatively impacted should metallurgical recoveries prove to be less than that 
used in the study or positively impacted if recoveries are higher. Similarly, if further rock mechanics or 
other studies lead to changes in the inputs to this study, the project could be impacted positively or 
negatively. It is unlikely that changes will impact the NPV by more than 20%, with the largest likely 
impact being future changes in the price of gold and silver. 

26.0   RECOMMENDATIONS 
In this PEA study, both owner-operated and contractor mining scenarios mined 469,000 ounces of gold 
in Indicated, and Inferred categories.  To date, the identified targets at Gold Springs have not all been 
sampled.  A reverse circulation drilling program designed to define a third target and to expand Grey 
Eagle and Jumbo is recommended.  All holes should be surveyed upon completion. The authors 
recommend drilling some core holes to add to the geologic understanding of the veins and related 
structures. These core holes should be used to gather specific gravity data. Additional detailed 
geological work is recommended which would focus on collecting geologic information from detailed 
mapping along with geochemical work programs focusing on the collection of rock chip, soil, stream 
sediment, and bio-geochemical samples.  With the thought of advancing the project toward possible 
production it is recommended that several large diameter core holes be drilled in each deposit area to 



Gold Springs Project 
TriMetals Mining Inc.  Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Page 159 of 167 

provide samples for metallurgical test work. Environmental baseline studies should be initiated in the 
resource areas and in areas of possible facility sites. It is estimated that this continuing exploration at 
the Gold Springs property will require an expenditure of approximately US$3,383,000.  

With a well-executed plan, the project could follow a similar timeline to production as other Nevada-
based gold projects.  A Mine Plan of Operations, Environmental Impact Statement, infill drilling, 
Prefeasibility Study, and Feasibility Study could potentially be completed in the next 3.5 years following 
the final PEA. 

26.1 BUDGET FOR DRILL PROGRAM IN 2014 
The proposed program and budget for the Gold Springs project would consist of approximately 10,680 
metres  (35,000 feet) of RC drilling focused on expanding resources at both the Grey Eagle and Jumbo 
targets and to define a potential third resource area. In addition, 610 metres (2,000 feet) of core drilling 
designed to secure material for metallurgical work on both of the resource areas would be completed.  
Plans would also include continuing the permitting process and conducting additional metallurgical test 
work. A total budget of US$3,383,000 is proposed for the project.  

The drill season typically starts in April. At the Jumbo target, drill pads are in place for an initial 15-20 drill 
holes before drilling moves to the Grey Eagle area. Grey Eagle drilling would continue to expand the 
resource to the south, testing up-dip portions of the system that have been down faulted. In addition 
drilling would continue to the west of the resource area where structural interpretations suggest that the 
stacked vein system may be up-faulted. Approximately 35 additional holes are planned for the Grey Eagle 
resource area. 

Total drill costs which include drilling, geochemistry, road construction, and surveying amount to 
US$1,592,000 

26.1.A  PROPOSED BUDGET 
The following is a summary of the budget related to the proposed exploration program: 

Labor, Field Expenses Benefits:        $791,000 
Land:           $242,000 
Exploration including Drilling, Geochemistry      $1,592,000 
Environmental          $334,000 
Other:           $424,000 
Total           $3,383,000
