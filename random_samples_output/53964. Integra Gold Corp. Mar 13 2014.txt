1.0 SUMMARY (Item 1) 

At the request of Integra Gold Corp. ("Integra"), a TSX Venture Exchange 
listed company (TSX-V: ICG), Géologica Groupe-Conseil Inc. ("Geologica") was 
given the mandate to complete an update of the NI 43-101 Technical Report on 
the Lamaque property, to reflect material changes since the last NI 43-101 
Technical Report  dated November 1, 2013 and filed on SEDAR. 

Alain-Jean Beauregard and Daniel Gaudreault of Geologica Groupe-
Conseil Inc. and Christian D'Amours of Geopointcom Inc. are Qualified Persons 
under National Instrument 43-101. Alain-Jean Beauregard and Daniel Gaudreault 
have visited the property on several occasions between the fall of 2009 and 
February 2014, and supervised all exploration work completed on the subject 
property since the fall of 2009. 

Location & History 

The Lamaque property is located in the Val-d'Or gold camp in 
northwestern Québec, approximately 550 km northwest of Montréal, Québec. 
The property consists of four contiguous Mining Concessions and twenty mining 
claims for a total of 1,459 hectares, 100% owned by Integra. None of the claims 
are within park, forest reserves or other areas that are restricted from exploration 
and mining. 

The property includes much of what constituted the exploration portion of 
the mine property of Lamaque Gold Mines Limited which, for parent company 
Teck Hughes Gold Mines Ltd., and later Teck Corporation, produced a total of 
4,554,167 ounces of gold between 1935 and 1985. The property does not 
include the four main mines that provided the majority of the ore for the former 
owners. 

The property's northeastern boundary lies next to the past producing 
Sigma Mine and pit, which has produced 4.7 million ounces of gold (published 
June 23, 2009) from 1935 to the present, and has approximately 5,000,000 gold 
ounces in resources and reserves. To the southwest is the Goldex Mine owned 
by Agnico-Eagle, reporting 3.5 million gold ounces in resources and reserves, 
and directly to the west of the Goldex Mine, the Osisko Canadian Malartic open 
pit gold mine reporting 10.71 million proven and probable gold ounces. The 
adjoining Cadillac, Malartic and Val-d'Or camps have produced over 45 million 
ounces of gold since the 1930s and presently encompass seven producing gold 
mines (15 million ounces in reserves). 

Geology 

The property is principally underlain by steeply dipping east-west striking 
volcanic flows intruded by a variety of intermediate to mafic plugs, dykes and 
sills. The mineralized zones are "Vein-Type" mesothermal structurally controlled

deposits, which are typical of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt and abundant in other 
Archean greenstone belts around the world. 

The gold bearing quartz-tourmaline veins are geologically younger and cut 
all rock-types, including irregular intrusive (diorite) bodies, which are affected by 
regional deformation and greenschist grade metamorphism. Two principal types 
of veins occur at the nearby Lamaque Mine: subvertical and subhorizontal veins. 
The subvertical veins occur within steeply dipping east-west trending ductile 
shear zones along which reverse sub-vertical displacements have taken place. 
The veins occupy openings created by irregularities during progressive 
movement within the shears. Subhorizontal veins occupy extensional fractures, 
which formed between ductile shear zones, preferentially in the more competent 
host rocks. According to Neumayr et al (2000), the mineralized zones and 
deposits at Lamaque are second- and third-order structures related to 
deformation along the Larder Lake – Cadillac Fault Zone which itself represents 
the first-order structure. 

The nine more significant mineralized zones are grouped in three clusters 
of mineralized zones known as the North, South, and West Cluster. The North 
Cluster consists of the Parallel, Fortune, No. 3 Mine, and No. 5 Plug; the South 
Cluster consists of No. 4 Plug, Triangle, and Triangle South Zones; and the West 
Cluster consists of the Sixteen and No. 6 Vein zones. 

In total there are twelve zones of known gold mineralization on the 
Lamaque property comprising various simple vein structures, vein complexes 
and stockwerk zones. They are: 

- Parallel Zone (including historical No. 10, No. 5 and No. 7 Veins); 
- Fortune Zone (previously known as Forestel); 
- No. 4 Plug; 
- No. 5 Plug (including No. 35 Veins); 
- No. 3 Mine (including No. 1 and 2 Veins); 
- Triangle Zone; 
- South Triangle Zone; 
- Mylamaque Zone; 
- No. 4 Vein; 
- No. 6 Vein; 
- Sixteen Zone; and 
- Sigma Zone. 

Exploration and Drilling 

Since 2004, several diamond drill programs were completed on the 
Lamaque property by Kalahari Resources Inc. ("Kalahari") (in December 2010 
Kalahari's name was changed to Integra Gold Corp.). Since 2009, drill 
supervision, program planning and quality assurance/quality control ("QA/QC")

 Recently (June to December 2013), a total of 24,339.48 meters of 
diamond drilling were completed on the South Triangle, No. 3 Mine and Parallel 
Zone by Orbit-Garant Drilling of Val-d'Or (Québec). The drill core samples were 
assayed by ALS Chemex and Bourlamaque Assay Laboratory in Val-d'Or 
(Québec). The planning, core logging, data validation and supervision of the 
2013 drilling program were completed by Geologica, with technical and logistics 
assistance from Integra. Most of the drilling consisted of definition diamond 
drilling of the Parallel Zone and exploration drilling on the South Triangle Zone 
and No. 3 Mine.

Resource Estimate 

The 2012-2013 Mineral Resource Estimates herein were completed by 
Christian D'Amours, P.Geo. (OGQ #226) of GéoPointCom, using all available 
results as per the effective date for each zone. GéoPointCom took this mandate 
directly from Hervé Thiboutot, geological engineer and Senior Vice-President of 
Integra Gold Corp. ("the client"). The main objective of this work was to publish 
the results of a revised mineral resource estimate for four zones of the Lamaque 
Project. The mineral resources presented herein are not mineral reserves since 
they have no demonstrable economic viability. The result of the study is Mineral 
Resource Estimates for four mineralized zones (Fortune Zone, Parallel Zone, No. 
4 Plug and Triangle Zone) with Indicated and Inferred Resources, modeled for 
underground mining. The effective date of the Mineral Resource Estimates varies 
from zone to zone but the published date, via news release, was September 25, 
2013.

In November and December 2013 Mineral Resource Estimates herein   

were completed by Christian D'Amours, P.Geo. (OGQ # 226) from 
GéoPointCom, using all available results as per the effective date for two new 
zones (No. 6 Vein and Sixteen Zone). GéoPointCom took this mandate directly 
from Hervé Thiboutot, P.Eng, Senior Vice-President of Integra Gold Corp. The 
mineral resources presented herein are not mineral reserves since they have no 
demonstrable economic viability. The result of the study is Mineral Resource 
Estimates for these two new mineralized zones with Indicated and Inferred 
Resources. The effective date of the Mineral Resource Estimates by press 
release is January 28, 2014.

Recommended Exploration Plan 
Geologica considers that the fundamental control on mineralization on the 

Lamaque property is structural, and recommends that a structural interpretation 
to define potentially mineralized shear and fault structures, both cross cutting and 
parallel to stratigraphy, be refined particularly for the four main deposits; namely 
the Parallel, Fortune, Triangle, and No. 4 Plug, for which updated resource 
estimates are now available. In addition, a comprehensive digital database 
should continue to be compiled with all drillhole information including surveys, 
geology, assays and all technical surveys available. Reprocessing of the existing 
1985 ground magnetic data and 2006 airborne geophysics and the acquisition of 
new and enhanced geophysical data are also recommended to help develop a 
better interpretative structural model. 

Geologica believes more drilling is warranted to better define and test for 
lateral and depth extensions of the already known mineralized zones, while 
continuing to explore for other veins. This new data will facilitate the updating of 
actual resource estimations and possibly lead to the development of more 
resources. For example, definition drilling on the Triangle and South Triangle 
zones is likely to result in increased mineral resources as well as an 
enhancement of the mineral resource category. Effective exploration to advance 
Triangle and South Triangle Zones will require both validation at depth and closer 
spaced definition drilling for future development and underground access. 

Geologica believes that the Lamaque property merits further exploration 
and the proposed exploration plans are therefore properly conceived and 
justified. As previously mentioned, with the expansion of the known resources at 
the four established main zones combined with future upgrading of historical 
resources on other zones as well as those zones awaiting compilation and 
validation, Geologica believes the potential exists for the Lamaque property to 
host more than 1.5 million ounces of gold resources. Identifying this potential 
could be accomplished through the recommended multi-phase exploration 
program.

In order to adequately advance Integra's Lamaque property, Geologica 
recommends a budget totalling $8,570,000. The objectives are: 

1) Complete pre-feasibility stage geological, engineering and environmental 
studies; 

2) Advance the project to feasibility stage; 
3) Increase the confidence level of existing resources; and 
4) Test extensions and exploration targets with the objective of increasing 

total contained ounces. 
The outlined program will: 

a) Focus on follow-up surface definition drilling of known mineralized zones 
located both within the north and south clusters for a total of 40,000 m. 
This will help convert resource categories to higher confidence levels and 
possibly add to the resource base. 

b) Test the extensions of some of the existing deposits in order to increase 
the resource base (included in the 40,000 m drilling program from part 
(a)). 

c) Focus on pre-feasibility stage technical studies which will include 
engineering studies, environmental studies, metallurgy, capital and 
operating cost studies, structural rock mechanics, hydrogeological and 
hydrological studies, rock mechanics, permitting, preparation and 
submittal of Certificate of Authorization (CA) requests, and completion of 
pre-feasibility reports.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE (Item 2) 
At the request of Integra, Geologica was given the mandate to complete an 

update of the NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Lamaque property to reflect material 
changes since last published NI 43-101 Technical Report dated November 1, 2013 
and filed on SEDAR. 

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS (Item 3) 
Geologica professionals Alain-Jean Beauregard and Daniel Gaudreault are 

Qualified Persons under National Instrument 43-101 and have visited the property on 
several occasions between the fall of 2009 and December 2013. They have 
supervised all exploration work completed on the subject property since the fall of 
2009. 

Geologica has relied on public documents filed at the Ministry of Natural 
Resources of the Province of Quebec (MRNQ) and information provided by Integra 
for the descriptions of title and claim status. 

Moreover, some parts of this report were taken from reports mostly prepared 
by previous property owners, as well as from federal and provincial government 
studies. 

Geologica is pleased to acknowledge the helpful cooperation of Integra 
management and exploration personnel, all of whom made any and all data 
requested available and responded openly and helpfully to all questions, queries and 
requests for material. 

There are no known environmental concerns or land claim issues pending with 
respect to the Lamaque property. It is understood and agreed that the property was 
received by Integra "as is" and that Integra shall ensure that all exploration programs 
on the property is conducted in an environmentally sound manner. 

All currency amounts are stated in Canadian dollars. Quantities are stated in 
both imperial and SI units (Canadian and international practice), including metric 
tonnes (tonnes, t) and kilograms (kg) for weight, kilometres (km) or metres (m) for 
distance, hectares (ha) for area, grams (g) and grams per metric tonne (g/t) for gold 
grades; and grams per metric tonne (g/t) for silver, platinum and palladium grades; 
percentage (%) for nickel and copper grades. Precious metals quantities may also be 
reported in troy ounces (ounces), a common practice in the gold mining industry. 

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION (Item 4) 
4.1  LOCATION AND CLAIMS

The property consists of parts of four contiguous Mining Concessions ("CM") 
numbered 375, 380, 264 and 314 and 20 mining claims (Table 1 and Figure 3). The 
property is registered to Integra for a total of 1,459.42 ha and is 100% owned. None 
of the claims are within park or forest reserves that are restricted from exploration 
and mining. This fieldwork report mainly concerns mining claims C002091, C002092, 
C002093, 3691171, 5275588 and 5275589. 

The four Mining Concessions grant surface and mineral rights, have no expiry 
dates and remain in good standing provided a small amount of work is carried out or 
payment in lieu of work is made each year. The mining concessions have been 
legally surveyed. 

The status of the claims was verified using GESTIM, the government system 
for management of claims, available on the Quebec Natural Resources website: 
https://gestim.mines.gouv.qc.ca. There are no surface rights associated to the land 
holdings.

The property includes much of what constituted the mine property of Lamaque 
Gold Mines Limited, which for parent company Teck Hughes Gold Mines Ltd. (later 
Teck Corporation and today Teck Resources Limited) ("Teck"), produced a total of 
4,554,167 ounces of gold between 1935 and 1985. The property does not include the 
four main mines which provided the majority of the ore for the former property 
owners. 

4.2  ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATION  
Part of the property is covered by tailings from the previous mining operations 

at the Lamaque Mine from 1935 to 1985 (Figure 2). The tailings are largely confined 
by a tailings dam. The dam and tailings are stable and fairly dry and support grasses 
and herbaceous growth. Teck (and its predecessors) previously planted conifers on 
various parts of the tailings and these trees appear to be doing well. The tailings do 
not appear to have the potential to generate acid mine drainage. Teck still retains 
legal responsibility for the tailings. 

Depending on season and weather, parts of the tailing are wet, with standing 
water and intermittent creeks. Excess water exits the tailing area through runoff over 
two open spillways. 

In order to conduct exploration work, Integra must respect all laws relative to 
exploration, and request all appropriate forestry intervention permits from the Québec 
Ministry of Natural Resources department for all drilling and trenching related 
activities. 

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY (Item 5) 

 The town of Val-d'Or is on highway 117, east of the town of Malartic and the 
city of Rouyn-Noranda. Highway 117 crosses the northern part of the property and 
provides access to the property. The property is immediately adjacent to the eastern 
limits of the city of Val-d'Or and is accessible from Val-d'Or via public and bush roads 
suitable for 4-wheel drive vehicles. One of the most prominent and useful of these 
gravel roads is that built on the tailing retention dykes. The Val-d'Or airport is located 
on the southern edge of the property and has regularly scheduled flights to and from 
Montréal. 
 Val-d'Or, with a population of approximately 35,000 persons, is a modern city 
and one of a number of communities in the Abitibi region of Québec with a long and 
rich mining heritage. Both the Lamaque and Sigma mines are situated within the 
municipality of Val-d'Or. These two mines were the largest producers in the area. All 
requirements, including a quality supply of hydro-electric power to support a mining 
operation, are available in Val-d'Or. On or near the property there is an ample supply 
of timber and water to supply a mining operation. There is a plentiful supply of skilled 
workers for all aspects of exploration and mining available in the area. 
 A large swamp partially covers parts of the property, while spruce forest and 
mixed deciduous and coniferous forest cover the eastern, western and southern

extremities. The relief rarely exceeds 50 m, except where eskers and glacial deposits 
are found. The property is at an elevation of about 320 m above sea level. 
 The tailing retention area covers a large part of the central part of the property. 
As described under Environmental Issues, this tailing area is generally populated 
with herbaceous growth, grasses and areas of small trees planted by Integra's 
predecessors. Spruce forest and mixed deciduous and coniferous forest cover much 
of the rest of the property. 

Based on Environment Canada statistics, from 1971 to 2000, the region is 
characterized by a mean daily temperature of 12° Celsius (C). The month of July has 
an average temperature of 17.2° C, whereas the month of January averages -17.2° 
C. The extreme minimum recorded temperature was -43.9° C, whereas the highest 
recorded temperature was 36.1° C. There were 209 days recorded below freezing 
point. The average annual precipitation is 954 mm. The month of September 
receives the highest average precipitation with 101.5 mm of rain. However, July has 
the highest daily precipitation with 68 mm of rain. Snow falls from October to May 
with the highest snowfall between November and March. The monthly average 
precipitation (in mm of rain) for this six month period is 54 mm. 

6.0 HISTORY (Item 6) 

The production, resource and reserve estimates, indicated below in this Item, are of 
historical nature and do not comply with NI 43-101. However, the authors believe that 
this information gives a conceptual indication of the potential of the area and that it is 
pertinent to this report. The qualified persons have been unable to verify the 
information and the information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on 
the property that is the subject of this technical report. 

 6.1  BEFORE 2003 
 The early history of the Lamaque Mine is described by Wilson in 1948. He 
describes the original gold discovery by R. Clark in 1923 and subsequent staking of 
the original claims the same year followed by prospecting, stripping and trenching. 
 In 1928, Read-Authier Mines Limited was formed to acquire the Lamaque 
property and in 1929, 19 surface diamond drillholes totalling 2,143.05 m (7,031 feet) 
were drilled. 
 In 1932, Teck-Hughes acquired an option on the property and drilled five holes 
totalling 519.68 m (1,705 feet) to confirm previous results. The 1932 drilling returned 
positive results and Teck-Hughes exercised its option, forming Lamaque Gold Mines 
Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of Teck-Hughes), to take over the original 
property and a number of the adjoining claims. 
 Wilson reports that a shaft was sunk beginning in January 1933 and lateral 
work followed as well as construction on the original mill in the summer of 1934. The 
mill started operations at 250 tons per day in April 1935; was increased to 500 tons 
per day by the end of 1935 and to 1,000 tons per day by December 1937.

 Subsequently, further shafts were sunk adjacent to the Main Mine or No. 1 
Mine. These shafts include the number 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 shafts and the 
development of the East and West Mine areas. The No. 2 Mine, approximately 
1,158.24 m (3,800 feet) northeast of the Main Mine area (not to be confused with the 
No. 2 Shaft located on the Integra property), close to and on the extension of Sigma 
Mine structures, was developed in 1950-1951 to a depth of 410.56 m (1,347 feet) 
with nine levels developed. Production from the No. 2 Mine ceased on November 30, 
1955. None of the Main, East or West mines (comprising the Main Mine and Mill 
Complex), or No. 2 Mines are on the property (Figures 2 and 3 for location); but they 
all contributed to the tailings that cover part of the property. 
 In late 1955 a new discovery approximately 1,371.6 m (4,500 feet) southeast 
of the Main Mine was made and in late 1960/early 1961 a shaft was sunk on the new 
zone with a three compartment vertical shaft to 146.3 m (480 feet) with three levels. 
In the summer of 1961, development work for three zones in the No. 3 Mine took 
place. This shaft, known as the No. 3 Mine shaft, along with its mineralization, is 
situated underneath the actual tailings. Historical records indicate that the No. 3 Mine 
yielded 152,015 tons grading 0.220 oz Au/ton. 
 Subsequently, drifts were extended toward the No. 4 Plug from the No. 3 Mine 
area to provide access at the 450-foot (137.16 m) and 700-foot (213.36 m) levels. 
The No. 4 Plug was mined and yielded 160,000 tons grading 0.152 oz Au/ton from 
workings above the 700-foot level. Production for the No. 3 Mine and No. 4 Plug 
areas extended from July 1961 to the end of 1967. On the 300-foot (91.44 m) level 
the No. 3 Mine is also connected with the upper part of the No. 5 Plug. 
 In May 1985 all production at the Lamaque Mine ceased. The Lamaque mill 
was kept on a stand-by basis for custom milling until 1986. Total production from the 
historical Lamaque Mine from 1935 to 1985 totalled 4,554,167 ounces of gold 
distributed over nine mineralized zones (see Table below).

 Post-shutdown, Teck and Golden Pond Resources Ltd. ("Golden Pond") 
formed the Teck-Golden Pond joint venture ("JV") and Teck and Tundra Gold Mines

Integra Gold Corp.

Inc. ("Tundra") formed the Teck-Tundra JV to explore a portion of the historical 
Lamaque property. The Golden Pond JV and some of the Tundra JV covered most of 
the ground now owned 100% by Integra (excluding the Lamaque Mine area under 
the Tundra JV), but in addition included two small claims on the southern limit of the 
Villemaque block (claims previously identified as 422883-2 and 421475-2). The 
Tundra JV also included two non-contiguous parcels: the first parcel of land centred 
on the No. 5 Plug and the second parcel centred on the No. 4 Plug. Teck was the 
operator for both the Golden Pond and Tundra JV programs. 
 Subsequently, in December 1988, Tundra signed an agreement with Teck to 
acquire a 100% interest in all of Teck's assets at Lamaque. The assets to be 
acquired included the Main Mine property, all surface structures including the mill, 
surface and underground equipment, and Teck's interest in the Tundra, Golden Pond 
and Roc d'Or Mines agreements. The purchase price for the assets was $8,000,000. 
Tundra was also required to complete an exploration program and sink an 
exploration shaft to 304.8 m (1,000 feet) on the No. 4 Plug. Preliminary work was 
initiated to meet the obligations of the agreement but a downturn in the industry 
made funding difficult and the 1988 option was never exercised, leaving Teck with a 
100% interest in the Main Mine and mill area, which was eventually optioned and 
purchased by Placer Dome Inc. Subsequently Tundra's and Golden Pond's interest 
in the Tundra and Golden Pond JV properties was diluted to 50% due to non-
payment of their respective portions of lease rentals, assessment filings and taxes. 

No exploration was conducted on the Tundra and Golden Pond JV properties 
between 1990 and 2003, when Kalahari and Teck Cominco signed their agreement 
providing Kalahari the option to earn Teck's interest in the JV properties. In 2009 
Kalahari purchased the remaining Tundra and Golden Pond interests in the 
properties through a share swap. Kalahari changed its name to Integra in December 
2010 and now owns 100% of the property. 

 6.2  From January 2003 to June 2013 
 During the period between January 2003 and June 2013, exploration work 
was completed on the Lamaque property, mainly via drilling campaigns. A total of 
over 115,326meters of drilling was completed, essentially distributed on the Fortune 
(previously known as Forestel), Parallel (including No.10 Vein), Triangle, No. 6 Vein, 
No. 4 Plug, No. 5 Plug, Sigma, Mylamaque, Sixteen Zone, and various geochemical 
and geophysical targets. The various drilling programs, and their results, were 
discussed in detail in previous version of NI 43-101 Technical Reports, all of which 
were filed on SEDAR. 

The drilling was completed by Orbit-Garant Drilling from Val-d'Or, Québec. 
Analyses were completed by Bourlamaque Assay Laboratory and ALS Canada in 
Val-d'Or. Supervision of the exploration work completed between 2003 and 2008 was 
conducted by Mr. Don Cross and Mr. Terrence Coyle; between 2009 and to the end 
of 2013, exploration orientation, geoscientific compilation, drill planning, core logging, 
data validation and geological mineralized zone interpretation of cross-sections and

longitudinal sections were conducted and supervised by Geologica Groupe-Conseil 
Inc. 

From 2009, drill supervision, core logging and QA/QC sampling protocols were 
designed and followed by Geologica personnel with duplicates, blanks and standards 
inserted for each drillhole. 

A re-sampling program of 2003-2008 diamond drill cores was conducted by 
Geologica, beginning in 2009. This re-sampling includes the addition of QA/QC 
samples and to date has included a total of 1,654 samples along with 319 QA/QC 
samples on 121 diamond drillholes.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION (Item 7) 
7.1  REGIONAL AND LOCAL GEOLOGY 

 The property is located in the Malartic Composite Block, or Malartic Group, in 
the southeastern section of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, a 750 km long by 250 km 
wide Island Arc volcanic complex, of the Archean Superior Province, Canadian 
Shield. The Grenville Front is located about 50 km to the southeast and the Cadillac-
Larder Lake Fault Zone, deformation zone or "Break" is located about one km south 
of the southernmost edge of the property. The Cadillac-Larder Lake Break runs for 
about 250 km and is the fundamental control for gold mineralization in the Val-d'Or, 
Malartic, Cadillac and Kirkland Lake camps (Figure 4). 

In the Malartic/Val-d'Or area, the Cadillac-Larder Lake Break separates the 
dominantly volcanic Malartic Block from the Pontiac Metasedimentary Subprovince to 
the south. 
 The Bourlamaque Batholith hosts a number of former gold producers (Bras 
d'Or, Belmoral, Stabell) and is located one mile northeast of the northeast corner of 
the property while the East Sullivan Stock is located to the east. The regional 
stratigraphy for the area is summarized in the table below.

7.2  LOCAL AND PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
 The property is principally underlain by volcanic flows and volcaniclastics of 
the Val-d'Or Formation (2705-2703 Ma), intruded by a variety of intermediate to mafic 
plugs, dykes and sills. The northern part of the property is underlain by lithologies 
comprising the lower part of the Val-d'Or Formation, while the mid to southern part of 
the property is underlain by units of the upper Val-d'Or Formation. The extreme 
southern section of the property, in the vicinity of the airport, is underlain by mafic 
volcanites of the Héva Formation. 
 There are twelve zones of gold mineralization, including six gold deposits with 
known resources on the Lamaque property. They consist of various simple vein 
structures, vein complexes and stockwerk zones. They are: 

- Parallel Zone (including historical No. 10, No.5 and No.7 Veins); 
- Fortune Zone (formerly known as Forestel); 
- No. 4 Plug; 
- No. 5 Plug (including No. 35 Veins); 
- No. 3 Mine (including No. 1 and 2 Veins); 
- Triangle Zone; 
- South Triangle Zone; 
- Mylamaque Zone; 
- No.4 Vein; 
- No. 6 Vein; 
- Sixteen Zone; and 
- Sigma Zone. 

The six known gold deposits are grouped into the North, South and West 
clusters. The North cluster consists of the Parallel and Fortune Zones but also the 
exploration targets known as the No. 5 Plug and No. 3 Mine. The South cluster 
consists of the No. 4 Plug, Triangle, and South Triangle Zone. The West cluster 
consists of the Sixteeen zones and No. 6 Vein.

The Val-d'Or Formation is characterized by interstratified and overlapping 
massive to pillowed lavas and volcaniclastics of andesitic to rhyolitic composition. 
Reports also mention one horizon identified as an exhalative chert horizon and in 
another instance, a horizon of magnetic agglomerate. Ground magnetic surveys and 
interpretations for the most part have failed to resolve volcanic units of contrasting 
magnetic susceptibility. Areas of enhanced magnetic susceptibility have generally 
been interpreted to represent various intermediate porphyritic intrusives in the host 
volcanics rather than volcanic units of contrasting magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic 
surveys to date have therefore been of little help in deciphering stratigraphic and 
structural relationships. According to Scott (2002) and based on yttrium-zirconium 
ratios, the volcanics from the lower Val-d'Or Formation are tholeiitic to calc alkalic 
transitional while up-section, to the south, the upper Val-d'Or units, are transitional 
tholeiitic to calc-alkalic. Because of their intimate spatial association with most of the 
known gold mineralization, the intermediate to mafic, mostly granodiorite to dioritic 
plugs and associated porphyritic dykes and sills that intrude the Val-d'Or Formation 
are of particular importance. Structural and temporal relationships, however, remain 
enigmatic for some of these porphyritic rocks because of poor outcrop exposure and 
dominance of the pervasive and obliterating tectonic fabric. 
 Most of the gold production at the Lamaque Mine (immediately to the north of 
the property) came from or was immediately adjacent to the Main Mine, largely in the 
Main Plug. Significant production also came from the East Plug at the east end of the 
Main Mine (not on the property). The Main Plug, measuring only 800 feet by 380 feet 
(243.84 x 115.82 m), is a chimney-like body and concentrically compositionally 
zoned. The outer rim of the body, in contact with its host volcanics, is diorite. Its 
diorite rim grades into a porphyritic quartz diorite and the core of the pipe is 
granodiorite. U-Pb zircon ages of 2685±3 Ma and 2682 Ma have been obtained on 
the Main Plug (Jemielita et al, 1990). The West Plug, southwest of the Main Plug, is 
only developed on a few levels and is a coarse porphyritic granodiorite. Similar pipe-
like porphyritic intrusions, the No. 4 and No. 5 Plugs, occur on the property. The 
No. 6 Plug may be partly on the property. The No. 4 Plug measures 350 to 400 feet 
(106.68 x 121.92 m) in diameter and extends to a depth in excess of 3,000 feet 
(914.4 m). It appears to be a composite intrusion with a western portion which is 
granodioritic and an eastern portion which is a fine- to medium-grained diorite. 
Burrows and Spooner (1989) reported that the Main, East and West Plugs are 
unusually sodic and enriched in barium and strontium and suggest these 
compositions are magmatic. Watts, Griffis and McOuat and Geologica consider that 
this sodium, barium and strontium enriched composition is more likely a reflection of 
gold-related hydrothermal alteration. As pointed out by Patton (1988) these plugs are 
foliated and have a consistent gross orientation with a steep (70o) northeastern 
plunge. U-Pb zircon geochronology dates the Main Plug at 2682 to 2685 Ma (Corfu, 
1993) making them Timiskaming in age, post volcanic but syntectonic. 
 More obscure are the various other porphyritic dykes and sills commonly 
intersected in drillholes and possibly concordant or sub-parallel with general

stratigraphy, but perhaps also extensively cross cutting. These sills and dykes, felsic 
to intermediate in composition units, are also important because of their common 
association with gold mineralization. Many of these bodies are dykes and/or sills but 
given the difficulties of geological mapping, poorly defined deformation and pervasive 
hydrothermal alteration, we would not rule out the possibility that some of these rocks 
represent flows or synvolcanic intrusions. 
 The volcano-sedimentary rocks have been metamorphosed to lower 
greenschist facies (quartz + sericite + albite + chlorite + carbonate + actinolite + 
chloritoid). Scott (2002) reports that all flow units of the Val-d'Or Formation have 
undergone silicification, sericitization and carbonatization to some degree, probably 
as a function of their original porosity. Throughout the drill logs prepared by Teck for 
the Golden Pond and Tundra JVs, various types and extents of alteration are 
documented. In most cases the alteration that is described is immediately peripheral, 
or enveloping quartz-tourmaline veins in either volcanics or intermediate porphyritic 
rocks. 
 The volcanics, on a regional scale, strike east-west to northeast-southwest 
and dip steeply to the north or south. Robert and Brown (1986) state for units south 
of the Bourlamaque Batholith, bedding is overturned with younging directions mainly 
to the south. At the regional scale and on the property, an east-west, steeply dipping 
tectonic fabric superimposed on the volcanic rocks obscures bedding in the 
volcanics. Teck's latest geological compilation maps by Madon (c. 1987) show very 
few stratigraphic orientations. Most of the measurements for orientation on outcrops 
are for schistosity, which is shown to be steeply dipping to vertical. Rarely are 
bedding attitudes shown. The few primary attitudes that have been mapped are 
contacts between volcanic rocks of contrasting texture and these often do not appear 
to parallel the strike of interpreted stratigraphy. Interpreted stratigraphy also does not 
always appear to parallel the trend of magnetic horizons. 
 Patton (1988) suggested that the volcanic rocks may be tightly folded with the 
"plugs" located at the fold noses. Tight folding would be compatible with regional 
interpretation. Patton also suggested that the "plugs" are in fact folded, and thickened 
sills or dykes occurring in the fold noses. Burrows and Spooner (1989) also 
suggested that the plugs represented the coalescence of parallel dykes. 
 The effectiveness of exploration programs might be enhanced if more detailed 
interpretation of the stratigraphic and structural relationships of the various 
lithological units could be achieved. 

7.3  MINERALIZATION 
  The more significant zones of gold mineralization or deposits known on the 
property contain various simple vein structures, vein complexes and stockwork 
zones. These zones are listed below: 

• Triangle Zone (South cluster); 
• South Triangle Zone (South cluster); 
• No. 4 Plug (South cluster);

• Fortune Zone (North cluster); 
• No. 5 Plug (North cluster); 
• Parallel Zone (North cluster, including historical No. 10, 7 & 5 Veins); 
• No. 3 Mine area (North cluster, including No 1 & 2 Veins); 
• No. 6 Vein (West cluster); 
• No. 4 Vein; 
• Sixteen Zone (West Cluster); 
• Mylamaque Zone; and 
• Sigma Vein. 
 From these mineralized zones and Plugs, the most significant were subdivided 
into three main clusters: North cluster (Fortune, Parallel, No. 3 Mine, No. 5 Plug); 
South cluster (No. 4 Plug, Triangle, Triangle South); West cluster (Sixteen, No. 6 
Vein). 

7.3.1 North Cluster 
7.3.1.1 Fortune Zone (previously known as Forestel Zone) 

The first drillholes were completed by Kalahari in the area north of the T-06 
Magnetic anomaly in 2003 and drilled further to the north but cut no significant 
mineralization. The first hole drilled in the area in 2004, T-06-04-01, was designated 
as the Forestel Zone discovery hole (now called Fortune). It intercepted a zone of 
0.183 oz Au/ton over 16.5 feet (≈ 5 m). 

Subsequently, eight additional holes were drilled to the east and west on 
sections at 100-ft (30.48 m) intervals and above the up-dip projection of the original 
discovery. Several of these holes intersected several zones of mineralization 
comprising quartz-carbonate and quartz-tourmaline veins with fine pyrite in foliated or 
tuffaceous mafic volcanics. Mineralization in holes T-06-04-06, T-06-04-02 and 
sporadic mineralization in T-06-04-08 up-dip from the original discovery can perhaps 
be correlated with the original discovery intersection. Other correlations are more 
tenuous. Assuming that the Fortune Zone represents veins in a series of steeply 
dipping, east-west trending P and Riedel shears, true widths for the discovery zone 
(intersection length -16.5 feet or 5 m) might be in the order of 60% of this figure for 
about 10 to 12 feet (3.04 to 3.65 m). 

7.3.1.2 Parallel Zone (including Vein No. 10) 
Parallel Zone and the No. 10 Vein complex are both located northwest of the 

No. 3 Mine (Figure 5). They consist of several sub-parallel en echelon pinch and 
swell veins, which are hosted within a narrow tabular shear zone or corridor that 
crosscuts all the lithological units. The vein itself generally ranges in width between 6 
and 60 inches (15.24 and 152.4 cm) and attains a maximum thickness of 103 inches 
(approximately 261.62 cm) in drillhole G-88-8. The higher-grade portion of this vein 
extends from section 111E to section 156E, a strike length of 1,150 feet (350.52 m). 
It dips between 50° and 60° towards the south and has a known vertical extent of 400 
feet (121.92 m) between 300 and 700 feet (91.44 and 213.36 m) below the surface.

The majority of the mineralization is hosted within fine- to medium-grained 
diorite with generally 1 to 3% of disseminated pyrite, locally up to 5%. Some zones 
are within intermediate to mafic volcanites with 1 to 3% of disseminated pyrite. 

The vein is hosted by a series of andesitic to dacitic flows, crystal tuffs and 
lapilli tuffs. Rocks proximal to the vein are reported as silicified. The highly siliceous 
zones are dyke-like in shape and competent. 

The vein or vein segments are composed primarily of quartz and carbonate 
with lesser amounts of tourmaline and chlorite. Pyrite is the predominant sulphide 
mineral but it is rarely present in quantities greater than 5%. Typically in the wider 
veins the pyrite and gold are confined to the margins of the vein, while the bulk of the 
vein is made up of bull quartz, carbonate fragments and tourmaline. 

The most recent interpretation of the No. 10 vein system for Teck by H. Hugon 
indicated that the veining is disrupted by a series of near-vertical normal faults. 
These faults strike approximately east-west and have displaced the vein between 10 
to 20 feet (3.48 to 6.09 m). They do not appear to be genetically related to the 
mineralization since they are generally barren except in close proximity to the 
veining. 

7.3.1.3 No. 5 Plug 
The No. 5 Plug is located in the northwest part of the tailing, approximately 

500 meters northeast of the Parallel Vein Zone and 790 meters north of No. 3 Mine 
Shaft, to which it is connected by a drift on the 700-foot (213.36 m) level. The No. 5 
Plug was mined and yielded 5,572 short tons grading 0.11 oz Au/ton (5,054 tonnes 
grading 3.8 g Au/t) from workings above the 3,200-foot (975 m) level. It is located 1.5 
km from the Main Mine shaft. 

The No. 5 Plug is composed of fine- to medium-grained diorite, 200 to 250 m 
in diameter with depth potential expansion. It is mixed with a granodioritic intrusion. 
The two intrusive units have similar competency and therefore should be equally 
good hosts for gold-bearing quartz veins; however, mining was restricted to the 
dioritic portion of the intrusive. 

7.3.1.4 No. 3 Mine (No. 1 Vein) 
No. 1 Vein is located 300 feet (91.44 m) north of the No. 3 Mine shaft, 

southeast of the No. 10 Vein complex (Figure 5). The vein is continuous over an 
east-west strike length of about 1,000 feet (304.8 m), extends from the 700 foot to 
1,200 foot (213.36 to 365.76 m) levels, and dips to the south at 80°. It ranges in width 
from 30 to 42 inches (76.2 to 106.68 cm). Potential for additional mineralization exists 
at depth where the vein was intersected in four other holes. None of these, however, 
encountered economic values. The auriferous zone most probably follows a plunge 
towards the east as is often observed for gold concentrations in ore shoots of the 
camp in general.

The vein is composed primarily of quartz and carbonate with lesser amounts 
of tourmaline. Pyrite is the predominant sulphide mineral but it is rarely present in 
quantities greater than 5 to 7%. 

7.3.2 South Cluster 
7.3.2.1 No. 4 Plug 

The No. 4 Plug is located on the southeastern part of the tailing, approximately 
3,500 feet (1,066.8 m) southwest of No. 3 Mine Shaft, to which it is connected by 
drifts on the 450 and 700-foot (137.16 m and 213.36 m) levels. The No. 4 Plug was 
mined and yielded 160,000 tons grading 0.152 oz Au/ton (145,136 tonnes grading 
5.21 g Au/t) from working above the 700 foot (213.36 m) level. Production for the No. 
3 Mine and No. 4 Plug areas extended from July 1961 to 1967. 

The No. 4 Plug is composed of an easterly portion of fine- to medium-grained 
diorite, 300 to 400 feet (106.68 to 121.92 meters) in diameter. It is enveloped on the 
west side by a granodioritic intrusion, which extends to the west for an additional 275 
feet (83.82 m). The two intrusive units have similar competency and therefore should 
be equally good hosts for gold-bearing quartz veins; however, mining was restricted 
to the dioritic portion of the intrusive. 

The intrusions are cut by a series of near vertical shears striking 70° to 90° 
and dipping 70° to 85° to the south. The best developed of these shears is the No. 6 
fault/shear. It has a dextral displacement of approximately 200 feet (60.96 m) and 
vertical displacement of 60 to 80 feet (18.28 to 24.38 m). The vertical shears have 
probably produced the brittle (Riedel) shears and tension fractures, which are 
believed to be the conduits along which the gold-bearing solutions migrated. 

The quartz veins are hosted by three dominant structural features: 
a) ductile "P" Shears; 
b) brittle "Riedel" or "R" Shears; and 
c) Tension Veins. 
The best mineralization is interpreted as occurring in a series of stacked, 

tabular subhorizontal bodies of minimum mining width interpreted to be tension veins. 

7.3.2.2 Triangle Zone 
 The Triangle Zone was discovered by drill testing an ovoid shaped magnetic 
anomalous zone which corresponded to a younger tonalite intrusion. The anomalous 
zone extends both east and west over a strike length of 393 metres and is 785 m 
wide. In drill core, the mineralized veins occur as part of a related vein cluster within 
the fractured and altered zones of the tonalite, which intrudes the surrounding 
intermediate to mafic volcanic rocks (mostly lapilli and blocky tuffs, undifferentiated 
pyroclastics and basalt). North of the Triangle Zone, two other similar ovoid shaped 
anomalous magnetic zones are believed to correspond to mineralized intrusions.

7.3.2.3 South Triangle Zone 
 The South Triangle Zone was discovered by drill testing an ovoid shaped 
magnetic anomalous zone which corresponded to intermediate volcanic units with 
magnetite and pyrrhotite. The auriferous zone is not this ovoid anomaly but an 
auriferous quartz-carbonate-tourmaline-pyrite vein with free gold within blocky and 
lapilli tuff. This zone was recognized over 100 m east-west and 50 m at depth. 

7.3.3 West Cluster 

7.3.3.1 Vein No. 6 
Vein No. 6 is located approximately 2,000 feet (609.6 m) west of the No. 1 

Main shaft (Figure 5). The vein has an east-west strike length of about 800 feet 
(243.84 m). Veins interpreted to be tension veins dip at about 50°. Steeper dipping 
veins (75°) are interpreted to be hosted in Reidel shears. 

The vein is hosted by a series of massive andesite or dacite and crystal tuffs 
and lapilli tuffs with several feldspar porphyry dykes. Generally a series of shear 
zones with vein injections cross-cut the dykes and tuffs. The vein itself generally 
ranges in width between 1 and 30 inches (2.54 and 76.2 m). 

The veins are composed primarily of quartz and carbonate with lesser 
amounts of tourmaline and chlorite. Pyrite is the predominant sulphide mineral but it 
is rarely present in quantities greater than 5%. 

7.3.3.3 Sixteen Zone 
The Sixteen Zone was named for the T-16 magnetic anomaly defined in a 

geophysical compilation from 1986. It is located in the western part of the property, 
just north of the southern By-Pass road (Figure 5). This zone is oriented roughly 
east-west and has a strike length of 800 feet (243.84 m). The zone is a system of 
quartz/tourmaline/pyrite veins and associated alteration, within a steeply north-
dipping, east-northeast trending, feldspar porphyry granodiorite dyke. The host dyke 
carries 15-20% medium grained, subhedral to euhedral, zoned feldspar phenocrysts 
in a sericitic light gray, aphanitic matrix. In general, foliation is weak but becomes 
strong to intense in the vicinity of the veins. This dyke, which can be up to 400 feet 
(121.92 m) wide, is one of several in a swarm that has intruded the surrounding lapilli 
to blocky tuff, and the dyke probably extends the length of the property. 

Within the property the mineralized zones are defined as mesothermal, 
structurally controlled deposits, which are typical of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt and 
abundant in other Archean greenstone belts around the world. The gold bearing 
quartz-tourmaline veins are young in geologic age and cut all rock-types, including 
irregular intrusive (diorite) bodies, which are affected by regional deformation and 
greenschist grade metamorphism. In the Sixteen zone, most of the gold intersection 
was in a porphyritic diorite and porphyritic granodiorite with 1 to 5% of pyrite in quartz 
tourmaline sericite carbonate veins.

The quartz/tourmaline veins dip shallowly to the north and are usually confined 
to the core of the granodiorite dyke, although occasionally they are seen along the 
granodiorite/volcanic contact. Correlation between vein intersections in adjoining 
holes has proven difficult and it is not known if the veins are tabular and laterally 
extensive or if they are more cylindrical. 

The veins vary in true width from less than an inch to several feet. Tourmaline 
can be up to 60%, but most often comprises 15-20% of vein volume. Pyrite occurs as 
medium to very coarse pyrite cubes within the veins. Strong to intense sericite and 
silica alteration, plus or minus minor tourmaline and fuchsite, with gray to pink to 
beige selvage displaying strongly foliated, remnant, porphyritic, granodiorite texture 
were observed. The selvages carry from 5 to 10% fine- to coarse-pyrite cubes. Gold 
is found along the contacts of tourmaline patches within the veins, as faint irregular 
gold-coloured patches in pyrite cubes, or as cryptic gold within the selvedges. 

It is possible that the veins and strongest alteration are concentrated in a pipe-
like feature, the plunge of which is unknown. The occurrence of the zone within one 
granodiorite unit at this particular place is an enigma. Flexing and cracking of the 
granodiorite associated with a nearby controlling structure, acting as a conduit from a 
nearby plug or intrusive may be one explanation. However, at this time, all is 
conjecture and the relatively unexplored length of the granodiorite dyke remains an 
important drilling target. 

7.3.4 Other Mineralized Zones 
Several zones of mineralization (No. 35 Vein, North and South Shears) 

located north of, and/or within the No. 5 Plug were drilled by the Teck-Tundra JV 
from 1986 to 1988 (Figure 5). Numerous other zones of mineralization have been 
reported or intersected on the property. Many of these zones were defined by 
intersections described in pre-1988 drillholes. In order to use this older data, a review 
of the older drillhole logs and a creation of a digital database is required so that the 
intersections can be plotted on plan and section. These zones, and new zones such 
as the Sigma Zone, will also be validated and verified with additional drilling and 
eventually evaluated with definition drilling permitting resource calculations to be 
completed. 

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES (Item 8) 
 Karvinen (1985) proposed a volcanogenic origin and control for the Lamaque 
gold mineralization suggesting that many of the porphyry units were volcanic and the 
associated gold mineralization was exhalative. Uranium-Lead-Zircon age dating of 
various porphyritic units and mineralization and structural relationships have since 
proven that the gold-bearing quartz-tourmaline veins are significantly younger than 
their host rocks. 
 Burrows and Spooner (1989) proposed that the intrusive plugs (Main, West, 
and East), showed a primary, magmatic gold enrichment and inferred the ore bodies 
formed from the remobilization of this primary gold. According to Feng et al, (1993)

Integra Gold Corp. 

38

the elevated gold values in samples from the intrusive are due to secondary 
enrichment in the halo of an ore-forming system. 
 Original opinion (Wilson, 1948) was that the Lamaque mineralization 
represented structurally controlled deposits. Wilson describes mineralization at the 
Main Plug as controlled by a series of east-west trending stacked thrust faults, which 
occur one below the other and dip into the intrusive with the gold-bearing quartz-
tourmaline veins in the thrust faults and subsidiary fractures. Wilson also describes 
how competency of the host rock controls the expression of deformation and foliation 
associated with the faults and fractures. Wilson reported that movement along the 
faults, in hard competent rock, resulted in considerable fracturing and brecciation and 
the development of numerous flatly dipping tension fractures hosting numerous gold-
bearing veins. 
 Similar descriptions to those related by Wilson are reported by Robert and 
Brown (1984 & 1986) in describing mineralization at the Sigma Mine, which 
represents the northern part of the same complex quartz-tourmaline vein system. The 
host rocks at Sigma, like those at Lamaque, are composed principally of andesitic 
flows, irregular intrusive bodies of porphyritic diorite and dykes of feldspar porphyry. 
Robert and Brown describe how the gold-bearing quartz tourmaline veins cut all rock-
types, which include an irregular body of porphyritic diorite affected by regional 
deformation and greenschist grade metamorphism and younger feldspar porphyry 
dykes. Robert and Brown report that the gold-bearing veins were emplaced lately 
and were cut by diabase dykes and have not been subject to pervasive deformation 
and metamorphism. Two principal types of veins occur in the mine – subvertical veins 
and subhorizontal veins. Robert and Brown describe the subvertical veins as 
occurring within steeply dipping east-west trending ductile shear zones along which 
reverse subvertical displacements have taken place. The veins occupy openings 
created by irregularities during progressive movement within the shears. 
Subhorizontal veins occupy extensional fractures which formed between ductile 
shear zones, preferentially in the more competent host rocks. 
 Neumayr et al (2000) present evidence that the mineralized zones and 
deposits at Lamaque and Sigma are second- and third-order structures related to 
deformation along the Larder Lake-Cadillac Fault Zone, which represents the first-
order structure. Similar models are commonly expressed for most gold mineralization 
associated with both the Larder Lake-Cadillac Fault Zone and the Destor-Porcupine 
Fault zones where splay faults which represent second order structures off the 
principal fault zones host the bulk of gold mineralization in the Timmins, Kirkland 
Lake and Val-d'Or Camps. 
 Geologica agrees with Wilson (1948) and Robert and Brown (1986), that the 
mineralized zones are mesothermal structurally controlled deposits typical of the 
Abitibi Greenstone Belt and abundant in other Archean greenstone belts around the 
world. They believe, however, that in detail the property-scale controls for the zones 
of mineralization are not well understood. To Geologica's knowledge there is no 
understanding and explanation for the clusters of gold-bearing veins in the No. 3 
Mine, No. 10 Vein and No. 6 Vein, Fortune, Sixteen, Triangle or Mylamaque Zones

9.0 EXPLORATION WORK (Item 9) 
 No new exploration work was completed on the property except than by 
drilling campaign described below on the Item 10.0. 

10.0 DIAMOND DRILLING (Item 10) 
 During the period from June to December 2013, a total of 24,339.48 meters of 
diamond drilling were completed on the South Triangle, Mine No. 3 and Parallel Zone 
by Orbit-Garant Drilling of Val-d'Or, Québec. The drill core samples were assayed by 
Bourlamaque Assay Laboratory and ALS Chemex in Val-d'Or, Québec. The 
planning, core logging, data validation and supervision of the 2013 drilling programs 
were completed by Geologica with the help of Integra technical assistance and 
logistics, from Val-d'Or, Québec. Most of the drilling consisted of definition diamond 
drilling on the Parallel Zone and exploration drilling on the South Triangle Zone and 
No. 3 Mine targets. 

10.1 South Triangle 
During the June to December 2013 diamond drill program, Integra completed 

13 diamond drillholes on the South Triangle Zone for a total length of 6,965.67 m. 
The aim of this program was to verify a magnetometric anomaly and depth extension 
of some mineralized zones of the South Triangle Zone (see technical parameter in 
the table below and Figure 6 for location).

In this zone, mainly basalt, lapilli and blocky tuffs were reported, with soome small 
sedimentary sequences also logged. The volcanic and sedimentary units often alternate 
with small granodiorite-diorite or gabbro sills and/or dykes. Generally chloritized, 
sericitized and silicified, the units are sheared and fractured. Faults are locally observed. 
Several mineralized veins were noted; their length varies between 0.5 cm and 100 cm 
with trace to 5% pyrite (locally up to 10%), and very locally trace to 3% pyrrhotite. The 
veins are made up of quartz-carbonate-tourmaline-chlorite and/or sericite-feldspar; 
epidote and calcite are rare. 
 

The company used appropriate Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QAQC 
protocol) with duplicates, blanks and standards. A total of 3,249 core samples and 440 
QAQC control samples were collected; the total sampled length is 3,134.40 m (45% of 
total drillhole core length). The table below presents the most significant intersections 
(complete results are available at the office of the company).

In this zone, mainly diorite sills were intersected with localy small dykes of 
feldspar porphyry. Generally chloritized, sericitized and silicified, the units are sheared 
and fractured. Several mineralized veins were logged; their length varies between 0.5 
cm and 300 cm with trace to 5% pyrite. The veins are made up of quartz-carbonate-
tourmaline-chlorite and/or sericite-feldspar; epidote and calcite are rare. 

 
The company used appropriate Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QAQC 

protocol) with duplicates, blanks and standards. A total of 1,597 core samples and 217 
QAQC control samples were collected; the total sampled length is 1,545.94 m (32% of 
total drillhole core length). The table below presents the most significant intersections

 The drillholes were completed to verify the lateral and depth extensions of some 
of the best results obtained in 2010-2011. Drillholes have intersected gabbro-diorite 
intrusive units with alternating metric bands of felsic to intermediate volcanics of rhyolitic 
to dacitic composition. Locally silicification, sericitization is present. Shearing is observed 
within the gabbro-diorite accompanied with intense chloritization, local fracturation, 
brecciation and pyritization (pyrite content from 2 to 3%; locally to 10-15%). Locally, 
pyrrhotite is present with similar proportions as the pyrite content. The gabbro-diorite 
host is weakly to moderately magnetic. Several quartz-carbonate veins were sampled, 
some with most significant thickness of 15 to 20 cm. 

 
The company used appropriate Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QAQC 

protocol) with duplicates, blanks and standards. A total of 5,438 core samples and 749 
QAQC control samples were collected; the total sampled length is 5,364.52 m (43% of 
total drillhole core length). The table below presents the most significant intersections 
(complete results are available at the office of the company).

10.4 No. 6 Vein and Sixteen Zone 

In 2010, 2011 and 2012, Integra completed fourteen (14) diamond drillholes on the 
Sixteen Zone totalling 2,816 meters, and sixteen (16) diamond drillholes on No. 6 Vein 
for a total length of 3,979.51 meters. The drilling programs have allowed completing 
resource calculations (during November and December 2013) by Geopointcom (see 
Items 14.1 and 14.2 below). The tables below respectively show the Technical 
Parameters of the drillholes for those zones and Figures 9 and 10 shows the drillhole 
location. All details for these zones are described on the NI 43-101 Technical Reports 
dated June 23rd, 2011 (amended September 21st, 2012) and November 1st, 2013 
respectively, available on  SEDAR.

The No.6 Vein host rocks mainly consist of chloritized intermediate to mafic tuffs 
and diorite. The diorite is silicified and locally sericitized and/or carbonatized. Shearing 
affects all rock types with, very locally, fractures and/or brecciation. Several mineralized 
veins with thicknesses varying from 0.5 cm to 90 cm, with trace to 7% pyrite (locally up 
to 10%), trace to 1% pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite locally, were logged; few of the veins 
contain a visible gold as trace. The veins consist of quartz-carbonate-tourmaline-chlorite 
and/or sericite-feldspar (see all details for these drillholes presented in the NI 43-101 
Technical Report filed on SEDAR in November 2013). 

11.0 PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY (Item 11) 
 No information was available to Geologica concerning sampling protocols for 
Teck's programs prior to their joint ventures with Golden Pond and Tundra in 1985 and 
1986, and joint ventures with Tundra and Golden Pond between 1985 and 1989. From 
the drill logs for the E-series holes which were reviewed, samples varied in length from 1 
foot to 3 feet (30 to 91 cm). Sample numbers are reported in the drill logs and assay 
reports listing; the sample numbers and assay results are appended to the logs. The 
header on the assay reports is Lamaque Mining Company Limited, indicating that the 
issuer was the company assay laboratory at the mine site. The assay reports indicate 
that many of the samples were assayed in duplicate. Geologica does not know if any of 
the core has survived. No records of surface sampling are known to Geologica. 
 Geologica is not aware of any written description of sampling protocol for either of 
these two joint venture programs operated by Teck, but they were likely based on Teck's 
protocols long established at the Mine. The drill logs Geologica has reviewed indicate 
that core samples selected varied in length from 1 foot to 4 feet (30 to 122 cm) and 
many were 3 feet (91 cm) long suggesting maximum sample lengths might have been 5 
feet (152 cm). The logs and our observation of surviving core indicate that both veins 
and altered intervals peripheral to veins were sampled. 
 For the drilling program carried out by Kalahari from 2003 to 2008, core intervals 
for sampling were selected during the core logging procedure by the logging personnel. 
Terrence Coyle, P.Geo. logged almost all of the Kalahari 2003-2008 drillholes. Don 
Cross logged the first few holes. Sample selection was based on evidence of 
mineralization such as quartz-tourmaline veining, the presence of sulphides or 
alteration. Sample lengths varied from a minimum of 1 foot to a maximum length of 3 
feet long (30 to 91 cm). Sample demarcation decisions were made on the basis of 
geology and for most part vein material was segregated from altered wall rock, which 
was segregated from apparently non-mineralized host rock. Core recovery is considered 
to have been close to 100%. The logging geologist marked the intervals to be sampled 
on the core using a lumber crayon and recorded the sampled intervals in the drill core 
logs. The intervals selected for sampling were sawn in half by a sampler using a 
diamond core saw. After cutting, one half of the sample was returned to the core tray in 
its original order to serve as an archive, while the other half was placed into a plastic 
sample bag with a numbered sample ticket. The same sample numbers were inscribed 
on the bag with a permanent marker. Three part sample tickets were used for sampling. 
One part of the ticket was placed in the sample bag, one part was placed in the core 
tray, secured under the first piece of archived core marking the beginning of the 
sampled interval and the third part was left in the sample book. The sample bags were 

 62 



 
  
 

secured with nylon pull locks. The samples were transported by Kalahari personnel to 
the Bourlamaque Assay Laboratory in Val-d'Or, Québec. 
 The relationship between sample lengths and true thickness is highly variable 
and difficult to quantify. It is dependent on the orientation of the drillholes and the 
orientation of the vein structures, both strike and dip of which are highly variable. 
Mineralization in the Lamaque area as described under the Mineralization section of the 
report comprises a variety of structures of diverse orientation and it can often be difficult 
determining which type of vein structure and orientation is being intersected. During 
logging, vein orientations are measured with respect to the core and recorded in the 
core log but even with such measurement of core angles, vein orientation and the 
relationships between sample length and vein structures can be problematic. The reader 
should also be aware that it is often vein systems rather than single veins that constitute 
mineralized zones and sample lengths for individual samples, even given known vein 
orientations often have little to do with the true widths of the mineralized zones. 
 The recent 2009-2013 drilling program was planned, logged, validated and 
supervised by Geologica at the Company's facilities in Val-d'Or, Québec (a core shack 
with logging stations, sampling, splitting with core saws and shipping to the laboratories). 
 The archived core from Kalahari's 2003-2008 and Kalahari/Integra's 2009-2013 
programs has been cross piled and stored at the Company's core shack facilities in Val-
d'Or, Québec. 
 Assay reports, appended to the drill logs, indicate that the pre-1985 samples were 
assayed at the mine assay laboratory still standing at the Main Mine-Mill site. Geologica 
is not aware of any record of crushing and grinding parameters or sub-sample size. It is 
believed likely that the assays were gravimetric fire assays using 1 assay ton (29.179 g) 
sub-samples. Records show that samples were often assayed in duplicate. 
 Similar to that for the pre-joint venture Teck programs, Geologica is not aware of 
any description of laboratory procedures used for assaying the Tundra and Golden Pond 
JV program samples. Assay reports appended to the drill logs indicate the principal 
assay lab was the company's facility at the mine site but also some check assaying was 
done at the independently owned, Bourlamaque Assay Laboratories Ltd. lab in Val-d'Or, 
Québec. The drill logs record the samples that returned assays above trace were re-
assayed several times. It is not recorded whether these re-assays were from original 
pulps or a new pulp cut from the sample reject. It is unknown what kind of, or extent of, 
QA/QC programs were run in conjunction with the regular sample assaying. Geologica 
believes the Bourlamaque Assay Laboratories Ltd. lab, being a commercial laboratory, 
would have used standards to assure quality. The mine laboratory may also have used 
international standards but certainly would have used a set of in-house standards and 
re-assays at the Bourlamaque lab to help maintain high quality assays. 
 One problem area concerning mine laboratories is with respect to mixing in the 
sample stream of mine samples that have a high potential to contain ore-grade values 
with exploration samples that rarely contain ore-grade values. Cross contamination 
problems can be aggravated by the lab failing to use clean sand or blank samples to 
clean the crushers prior to the introduction of differing sample batches and the 
accumulation of holdover gold, which can contaminate succeeding samples. As far as 
Geologica is aware no other samples were being assayed at the lab at the mine during 

 63 



 
  
 

the period the joint venture programs were being operated. Geologica does not know, 
however, what the policy at the lab was with respect to crusher washing and high grade 
samples. 
 All samples from Kalahari's 2003 to 2008 programs were assayed at the 
Bourlamaque Assay Laboratories Ltd. assay lab in Val-d'Or, Québec. All the analytical 
work completed at the Bourlamaque Laboratory was supervised by L.D. Melnbardis, 
B.Sc., licensed chemist, Order of Chemists of Quebec. The Bourlamaque assay lab is a 
non-accredited facility but it participates in reference material certification programs, 
extensive round robin studies and the Proficiency Testing Program for Mineral Analysis 
Laboratories through Natural Resources Canada, CANMET Mineral Technology Branch. 
 The standard protocol for Kalahari samples included the lead fire assay of a one 
assay ton subsample and a gravimetric finish. Sample preparation, which follows sample 
drying, includes primary (jaw) and secondary (cone) crushing of the entire sample to 
better than 60% -10 mesh (1.70 mm). A 250 g sub-sample is then split off from the 
crushed material using a 3/8" aperture Jones Riffler. In the final sample preparation step 
the 250 g sub-sample is ring pulverized to 95% -150 meshes (106 μm) and 
homogenized. 
 The protocol requires that one or two samples of barren rock be used to clean the 
crushers between each sample batch, and the pulverisers be cleaned between each 
sample with a brush and jet of compressed air. The protocol requires that duplicate 
samples be prepared at intervals of ten run-of-the-stream samples and be assayed. 
Inspection of Bourlamaque assay certificates shows that for every 10th sample, a 
duplicate assay was made on the original pulp and another assay was made of a 
second pulp cut from the sample reject. Standard practice at Bourlamaque also included 
the re-assay of samples that returned an initial assay greater than a threshold of 0.20 oz 
Au/ton. These re-assays also entailed a second assay on a one assay ton charge from 
the original pulp and an assay on a new pulp cut from the archived sample reject. No 
standards were used as part of the assay protocol. 
 Kalahari did not have a formal QA/QC program but carried out specific check 
sampling programs between 2003 and 2008 to help assure and assess assay quality. 
One step included the re-assay at Bourlamaque of a set of 45 samples by metallic 
screen procedures. These samples had been previously assayed at Bourlamaque using 
its standard fire assay on one assay ton subsample procedure. The procedure included 
the screening at 150 mesh (106 μm) of a nominal 250 g pulverized sample with 
duplicate one assay ton gravimetric fire assays on the undersize and fire assay of the 
entire oversize fraction. Kalahari undertook this re-assay by metallic screen procedure to 
compare the assays returned by the standard procedure with respect to the metallic 
screen procedure. 
 For drilling programs carried out by Kalahari (2009-2010) and Integra (2011-
2013), the sampling completed by Geologica was assayed by Bourlamaque Assay 
Laboratories Ltd. and ALS Chemex Laboratory in Val-d'Or, Québec. 
 Procedures for routine fire assaying are to initially crush the entire sample to –10 
mesh, then a 300 g sub-sample is split and pulverized to 95% - 150 mesh, and a 30 g 
sub-sample is fire assayed using standard industry procedures, with the gold content 
determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. For the Bourlamaque Assay 

 64 



 
  
 

Laboratories Ltd., each sample was assayed by Fire Assay and AA Finish, when values 
reporting ≥ 10 ppm Au are repeated by Fire Assay with a gravimetric Finish upper 
reporting limit of 100 g/t Au. 
 For security and quality control, diamond drill core samples were catalogued on 
sample shipment memos, which were completed at the time samples were being packed 
for shipment. Duplicates and blanks were taken and the partial core was photographed 
by geologists. The splitting of samples and sample preparation for shipping were 
completed by C-Lab and Integra's technicians under the supervision of Geologica. 
 The material used for standards comprised certified reference material purchased 
from commercial facilities specializing in their manufacture (RockLab via Anachemia in 
Ontario and CND "Analytical Solution Limited"). All material used for blank samples 
consisted of barren limestone. Laboratories also added their own quality control 
standards. In case of any doubt regarding the validity of a sample, the entire batch was 
re-assayed. 
 The authors believe that the sample preparation, security and analytical 
procedures were correctly applied. Results obtained by the laboratory are representative 
of the mineralization in comparison with results obtained in the past for all mineralized 
zones on the Lamaque property. 

11.1 Results of Quality Control 
11.1.1 Blanks 

The field blank used in the 2013 drilling programs (South Triangle, No. 3 Mine 
and Parallel Zone) is from a gold-barren sample of crushed white marble. One field 
blank is inserted for every 20 samples, alternating with standards. Geologica 
recommends a quality control protocol stipulating that if any blank yields a gold value 
above 20 ppb Au, the batch of sample containing the blank should be re-assayed. For 
the 2013 drilling program, no batch was re-assayed. 
11.1.2 Certified Reference Material (Standards) 

One certified reference material (CRM or "standard") was inserted for every 20 
samples, alternating with blanks, during the drilling programs. Four standards were 
used, with gold grades ranging from 1.348 g/t Au to 8.595 g/t Au as follows: 
 

• SH65 with a theoretical value of 1.348 ± 0.028 g/t Au 
• SK62 with a theoretical value of 4.075 ± 0.473 g/t Au 
• SL61 with a theoretical value of 5.931 ± 0.177 g/t Au 
• SN60 with a theoretical value of 8.595 ± 0.223 g/t Au 

 
Geologica's quality control protocol stipulates that if any analyzed standard yields 

a gold value above or below three times the standard deviation (±3SD) of the certified 
grade for that standard, then ten samples before and after the standard in the batch 
should be re-analyzed. 

After reviewing the results, Geologica personnel re-assayed 4 samples in 
accordance with this criterion, which represented less 0.01% of the database samples 
for 2013 for Triangle and South Triangle Zones. The re-assaying was done using pulps 

 65 



 
  
 

and rejects, or quarter-split core when no pulp or reject was available. All samples 
accompanying the standard (bearing the unacceptable gold result) during the fusion 
process were also re-assayed. The first gold values (the "wrong" values) were replaced 
in the database by the new gold values obtained by the re-assay. 
11.4.3 Duplicates 

The quality control protocol requires a coarse duplicate be prepared for one 
sample selected among every 30 samples. The duplicate is prepared by taking half of 
the crushed material derived from the original sample. By measuring the precision of the 
coarse duplicates, the incremental loss of precision can be determined for the coarse 
crush stage of the process, thus indicating whether two sub-samples taken after primary 
crushing is adequate for the crushed particle size to ensure a representative sub-split. 

Duplicates are used to check the representativeness of results obtained for a 
given population. To determine reproducibility, precision (as a percentage) is calculated 
according to the following formula: 

Precision (%) = 
(Duplicate Sample Gold Grade – Original Sample Gold Grade) 

X 100 
Average Between Duplicate Sample Gold Grade and Original Sample Gold Grade 

Precision ranges from 0 to 200%, with the best being 0%, meaning that both the 
original and the duplicate sample returned the same grade. 

A total of 143 original–coarse duplicate pairs were identified in the database. The 
correlation coefficient (%) is given by square root of R² and represents the degree 
scatter of data around the linear regression slope. The results obtained indicate an 
excellent reproducibility of gold values for 2013 with 80% and 100%. 

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION (Item 12) 
 The authors reviewed and verified the existing data of all available past and 
recent reports. According to elements reported in the statutory documents, sampling 
works and the analysis thereof seem to have been made according to standards in force 
at that time and still valid today, although a procedure and method are not described. 
Duplicates, blanks and standards samples were taken every 20 samples, on average. 
The authors believe that the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures were 
correctly applied and correspond with the present standards applied in the mining industry. 

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING (Item 13) 
 During the historic mining period from 1935 to 1985 at the Lamaque Mine, the 
plant capacity went from 250 to a final 2,200 tons per day. 
 The mill was a conventional cyanide operation, typical gold recoveries were 
around 95-98% and the authors are not aware that Lamaque ore exhibited any special 
metallurgical problems. The mill was dismantled and removed from the site in 1986. A 
large area south and east of the mine was used for tailings disposal.

13.1 Metallurgical testing by Integra 

 
A part of this section 13.1 was extracted from the technical reports of ALS Metallurgy Kamloops, 
titled: "METALLURGICAL TEST WORK ON THE LAMAQUE DEPOSIT LAMAQUE PROJECT, 
KM3569, April 3, 2013", "METALLURGICAL TEST WORK ON THE LAMAQUE DEPOSIT LAMAQUE 
PROJECT, KM3876, May 29, 2013" and "METALLURGICAL TEST WORK ON THE LAMAQUE 
DEPOSIT, KM4025, January 16, 2014".  
 
13.1.1 First Metallurgical Testing 

A first metallurgical test program was initiated by ALS Metallurgy Kamloops from 
Kamloops, B.C.,  November 5, 2012, on six composites represented by two clusters of 
sampling from the Lamaque property. The focus of this program was gold extraction via 
gravity and cyanide leach processing with some limited flotation testing. 

The three samples from each cluster, equal portions of each composite, were 
combined into a Master Composite for flow sheet development testing. Within each 
cluster, the samples were divided into a cutoff grade composite, an average grade 
composite and a high grade composite. The Cut-Off grade composites graded about 3 
g/t gold, the average grade composites graded about 6 g/t gold and the high grade 
composites graded about 15 g/t gold. 

The Master Composite graded about 8 g/t gold. Carbon was found to be about 
2% of the feed in Cluster 1 and about 1% of the feed in Cluster 2. Organic carbon 
assays showed only trace levels of organic carbon in the composites; organic carbon 
could have adversely affected cyanide leaching procedures. 

Iron content in Cluster 1 samples measured about 6% of the feed and about 4% 
of the feed in Cluster 2 samples; most of the iron was present in non-sulphide gangue 
minerals. Sulphur measured about 1.5% to 2% of the feed in Cluster 1 and about 1% to 
1.5% of the feed in Cluster 2; the sulphur was present almost entirely as pyrite with trace 
levels of chalcopyrite. The Master Composite feed was about 5% iron and 1.5% sulphur. 

Trace Mineral Searches for gold were conducted on the high grade composites of 
both clusters using QEMSCAN to determine liberation and association characteristics of 
the gold particles within the samples and to ascertain if differences between the two 
samples existed. Results showed that in the Cluster 1 samples, a higher percentage of 
gold was present in inclusions with other minerals compared with that of Cluster 2 
samples. Inclusions are when a gold particle is surrounded by other minerals. This could 
reduce or eliminate contact between a leach solution and the gold particle, possibly 
inhibiting leach performance. Finer grinding or increased leach times may be required to 
leach such gold particles. 

Cluster 2 had a higher combined percentage of gold particles that were liberated 
or associated with sulphide minerals compared to Cluster 1. These minerals would more 
likely be recoverable with a flotation concentrate. They would also likely have a higher 
specific gravity and may respond better to gravity separation. 

A Bond ball mill work index test was conducted on the Master Composite. The 
result was a Bond ball work index of 13.8 kWhr/t, which would characterize the 
composite as moderately soft. On the Master Composite, a series of Knelson gravity 
 67 



 
  
 

concentrations with hand panning of the gravity concentrate were conducted with 
cyanide leach extractions of the gravity tailings. These were completed at four primary 
grind sizes; 130, 105, 79 and 56μm K80. The best combined gravity and cyanide leach 
recovery obtained was about 89% at 79μm K80. A grind target of 75μm K80 was chosen 
by the client for subsequent testing of the individual composites. 

A rougher flotation test on the Master Composite conducted at a primary grind 
sizing of 130μm K80, recovered 89% of the feed gold to a rougher concentrate 
containing about 11% of the mass. A series of gravity concentrations with cyanide 
leaches of the tailings was conducted on the individual composites at primary grind 
sizings targeting 75μm K80, with 1,000 ppm sodium cyanide concentration in the 
leaching and with 48 hour leach duration. This showed a stark difference between the 
two clusters of samples. Cluster 1 showed lower gravity recovery as well as lower 
overall combined recovery. Tests on Cluster 1 samples recovered about 79% to 84% 
feed gold as opposed to about 93% to 94% feed gold being recovered from the tests on 
Cluster 2. Diagnostic leaching of leach tailings showed potential improvement of overall 
recovery from Cluster 1 samples to about 90% with increasing leach intensity or 
duration. Of about half the unrecovered gold from Cluster 1 tests, about 9% of feed gold 
was found to be in sulphide minerals and unrecoverable through leaching at the current 
primary grind sizing. 

Three sets of cyanidation tests were conducted on the Cluster 1 composites with 
attempts to improve recovery. Tests with increased cyanide concentration (5,000 ppm 
NaCN) improved Cluster 1 overall recoveries to about 86% - 90% feed gold. Tests with 
increasing leach duration to 96 hours without increased cyanide had improved overall 
recoveries, at about 88% - 89% feed gold. The best combined recoveries were achieved 
with 96 hour leach durations and with reducing primary grind targets to 50μm K80. This 
test showed improved gravity recovery, as well as improved overall recovery with about 
91% - 92% of feed gold being recovered. 

Two additional sets of gravity and cyanide leach tests were conducted on 
Cluster2 composites with 96 hour leach durations; these were conducted at primary 
grind sizings targeting 75 and 50μm K80. At the 75μm K80 target, overall gold 
recoveries from the feed were about 97%. Decreasing the primary grind to 50μm K80 
improved gravity recovery and resulted in overall gold recoveries of about 98% feed 
gold. 

A set of rougher flotation tests were conducted on the Cluster 1 composites to 
test the viability of such a method. These tests recovered about 82% - 90% of the feed 
gold, at primary grinds targeting 125μm K80. In conclusion, further test work should be 
conducted investigating a flow sheet incorporating both flotation and cyanidation of the 
flotation products. Detailed mineralogy should also be conducted to assess sulphide 
mineral liberations and associations. 
13.1.2 Second Metallurgical Testing 

A second metallurgical test program was completed by ALS Metallurgy from 
Kamloops, B.C., on samples from the Lamaque deposit during the spring of 2013. The 
focus of this program was to continue gold extraction test work pursuing a flowsheet 
involving a rougher flotation stage and cyanide leach extraction of gold from the product 
streams. 

 68 



 
  
 

Two master composites were prepared for commination testing. These 
composites, Cluster 1 Master Composite and Cluster 2 Master Composite, were 
comprised of equal parts Cutoff, Average and High Grade Composites from their 
respective cluster. Bond ball work indices were found to be 14.8 and 14.9 kWh/tonne for 
the Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 Master Composites, respectively. The composites could be 
described as moderately hard. 

Within each cluster, the samples were divided into a Cutoff Grade Composite, an 
Average Grade Composite and a High Grade Composite. The Cutoff Grade Composite 
graded about 3 g/t gold, the Average Grade Composite graded about 6 g/t gold and the 
High Grade Composite graded about 15 g/t gold. The Cluster 1 Master Composite 
graded about 9 g/t gold. 

Rougher flotation tests were performed on the Cluster 1 Master Composite at 
three primary grind sizes, 107, 133 and 206μm K80. The rougher concentrates from 
these tests were reground and subjected to 48 hour cyanide leaching, the rougher 
tailings were also cyanide leached for 48 hours without regrinding. Overall gold 
recoveries were about 96% at the primary grind size of 107 and 133μm K80, and about 
94% percent at a primary grind size of 206μm K80. The coarse grind size of 206μm K80 
was selected as the primary grind target for subsequent testing.  

When applied to the individual Cluster 1 Composites, the flowsheet had similar 
results to the Cluster 1 Master Composite at the target primary grind sizing of 206μm 
K80. For the Cluster 1 Average and Cluster 1 High Grade Composites, overall recovery 
of gold was about 95%. The Cluster 1 Cutoff Grade Composite had a lower overall 
recovery with about 90% of gold from the feed reporting to the leach liquors. The sodium 
cyanide dosage required for the flotation and cyanidation flowsheet was about 3 
kilograms of cyanide per ton feed. 

The gravity concentration followed by the whole ore cyanidation flowsheet from 
KM3569 was able to recover between 91% and 92% of the gold from the feed of each 
composite. This required a primary grind size of approximately 50μm K80 and 96 hour 
cyanide leach durations. 

An economic assessment of the energy and capital costs would have to be 
completed to determine which grind size and flowsheet configuration has the most 
economically cost effective extraction method. Further optimization of the cyanide leach 
process may result in lower cyanide consumptions and should be considered for future 
test programs. 
13.1.3 Third Metallurgical  Testing 

The focus of this third program initiated in 2013 but completed in early 2014, and 
also completed by ALS Metallurgy from Kamloops, B.C., was to test and compare four 
possible flowsheets in use in the Val-dÒr district, for four zones of mineralization 
representing the four new Lamaque deposit. 

Four composites were prepared from crushed drill core interval. These 
composites were named Parallel, Triangle, Fortune and No. 4 Plug. The four composites 
were reportedly prepared to be at a median range of gold grade respective to each 
zone. 

 69 



 
  
 

Gold head assays were conducted using a screened metallic assay method due 
to the apparent coarse nugget effect of the gold in the deposit. The composites assayed 
9.1, 8.8, 6.2 and 4.4 g/t gold for the Parallel, Triangle, Fortune and No. 4 Plug 
composites, respectively. 

Four flowsheets were tested. The first involved a gravity concentration followed 
by a carbon-in-leach cyanide leach of the gravity tails. The second was a whole ore 
cyanide leach and the third was a whole ore carbon-in-leach. The fourth flowsheet 
involved a flotation separation followed by a separate cyanide leach of the flotation 
concentrate and flotation tails. 

Gold recoveries from the first three flowsheets were similar. Using these three 
flowsheets, gold recoveries from the Parallel composite ranged from 97% to 98%, from 
the Triangle composite, gold recoveries were about 93%, from the Fortune composite, 
gold recoveries ranged from 96% to 97% and from the No. 4 Plug composite, gold 
recoveries ranged from 83% to 88%. The main difference in flowsheet performance was 
reagent consumption, with the carbon-in-leach extractions consuming about twice as 
much sodium cyanide. 

Gold recovery utilizing the flotation and leaching flowsheet was slightly lower; 
however, without including the leach of the flotation tailings, recovery would be 
substantially lower than the other flowsheets. Reagent consumptions for this flowsheet 
were lower. 

Between the first three flowsheets, recovery differences were small enough that 
reagent consumptions and other economic factors relating to the use of the different 
processing facilities would likely be more significant than the metallurgical differences. 

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES (Item 14) 
The 2012-2013 Mineral Resource Estimates herein were completed by Christian 

D'Amours, P.Geo. (OGQ # 226) from GéoPointCom, using all available results as per 
the effective date of each zone (including Triangle Zone). GéoPointCom took this 
mandate directly from Hervé Thiboutot, P.Eng, Senior Vice-President of Integra. The 
main objective of this work was to publish  revised mineral resource estimates for four 
zones of the Lamaque Project. The mineral resources presented herein are not mineral 
reserves since they have no demonstrable economic viability. The result of the study is  
Mineral Resource Estimates for four mineralized zones with Indicated and Inferred 
Resources, modeled for underground mining (Fortune Zone, Parallel Zone, No. 4 Plug 
and Triangle Zone). 

The Qualified and Independent Person responsible for the Mineral Resource 
Estimate, as defined by Regulation 43-101, is Christian D'Amours, P.Geo (OGQ # 226). 
This estimate is based on interpretation performed by Alain-Jean Beauregard, P.Geo. 
(OGQ # 227) and Daniel Gaudreault, P. Eng. (OIQ # 39834) from Geologica. 
Theresource estimates are part of a 43-101 compliant report prepared and supervised 
by Geologica Inc. The effective date of the Mineral Resource Estimates varies from zone 
to zone but the published date, by news release, is September 25, 2013. All details for 
these resource calculations are presented in the NI 43-101 Technical Report filed on 
SEDAR in November 2013.

In November and December 2013, Mineral Resource Estimates herein were 

completed by Christian D'Amours, P.Geo. (OGQ # 226) from GéoPointCom, using all 
available results as per the effective date of two new zones (Vein No. 6 and Sixteen 
Zone). GéoPointCom took this mandate directly from Hervé Thiboutot, P.Eng, Senior 
Vice-President of Integra. The mineral resources presented herein are not mineral 
reserves since they have no demonstrable economic viability. The result of the study is

Mineral Resource Estimates for these two new mineralized zones with Indicated and 
Inferred Resources. 
 
14.1 No. 6 Vein  

Estimation was performed from September to November 2013. The database 
used was completed on August 17, 2012. The last drillhole included and considerered 
was V6-12-12A. 

 
14.1.1 Methodology 

The Mineral Resource Estimate and geostatistical study detailed in this report 
was performed using Isatis (V.2013.1) software. The method involves a 3D Block Model 
estimated with Kriging. 
14.1.2 Drill hole sample database 

The Geotic/MS Access diamond drillhole database is maintained and updated by 
Géologica Inc. (P. Geo and P. Tech.) under the supervision of Alain-Jean Beauregard, 
P.Geo. and Daniel Gaudreault, P.Eng It contains 57 surface diamond drill holes with 
conventional analytical gold assay results, as well as coded lithology from the drill core 
logs. The 57 drillholes are distributed over 12,436 meters of core with 2,534 samples 
taken for a total of 2,378 meters of core saw-cut and assayed. The database also 
contains 268 QA/QC samples. 
14.1.3 Interpretation of Mineralized Zones 

The interpretation was completed by Benjamin Blaise, under the supervision of 
Alain-Jean Beauregard and Daniel Gaudreault. In order to conduct accurate resource 
modeling of the Vein No. 6, Christian D'Amours constructed a wireframe solid 
representing three (3) individual veins oriented N054/-30 (Vein A), N073/-30 (Vein B) 
and N082/-40 (Vein C). 

The wireframe solid was created by digitizing an interpretation onto twelve (12) 
sections spaced 25 m apart, and then using tie-lines to complete the wireframes for 
each individual vein (Figure 11). For each vein intersection, the minimum true thickness 
was set to 2 meters. When true thickness was inferior to the minimum thickness, internal 
dilution was included achieving the minimum thickness.

4.1.4 High grade capping  
It is common in the industry to remove some of the highest (aberrant) values from 

the assays distribution prior to compositing the samples. The main objective of this 
process is to make sure that the erroneous values could not affect grade estimation. 
With the development of statistical methods for estimating grade, this process became 
less important. In fact Kriging, and especially simulation techniques, are less sensitive to 
some very high values. On the other hand, the presence of some very high values may 
make the variogram very difficult to establish. Geostatistics provide some efficient tools 
to solve this problem. The more common methods used to assess the necessity of using 
a capping value are listed here. 

- The first indication of the necessity to capping high values is the coefficient of 
variation "CV". Ideally, this should be located close to 1. A CV superior to 2 is 
generally considered an indication of the necessity to capping high values. In fact 
this is highly related to the difficulty of producing a clean variogram when CV is 
very high. 

- In the case of a simple normal or log-normal population, the probability curve 
should form a relatively straight line. A positive break in the upper end is often 

 73 



 
  
 

interpreted as an indication requiring a capping of high values. This criterion is 
probably the strongest indication, especially when the interpolation method 
require for normal or log–normal distribution. 

- The metal factor method consists of comparing the cumulated metal percentage 
with the cumulated data percentage. This technique takes for granted that all 
samples represent an equivalent number of tonnes. Specialists generally agree to 
keep this factor below 10. In other words, there should never be more than 10% 
of ounces in less than 1% of tonnes. This method really concentrates on the 1% 
or 2% superior to the distribution. It is more a security factor than a distribution 
analysis. 
Figure 12 shows comparative distribution (density, histogram, Box Plot and 

probability plot) of gold values for all samples within each vein. From this, one can note 
that sample distribution from each vein may be assimilated to a log-normal distribution. 
The distributions of the metal content within the percentile classes are suggesting the 
use of a capping at 25 g/t. The relatively low value for the CV (2.68) may not argue in 
favor of a capping grade. Figure 13 shows the effect of different capping grades (prior to 
composition total ounces estimated when computed at 3 g/t CutOff. This graphic 
suggest the presence of two different populations. It is also evident that over 40 g/t 
Capping, the slope of percentage of ounces lost changes abruptly. To make it smoother, 
it is recommended to gradually limit the higher gold value (over 40 g/t) prior to 
compositing. When grade is over 40 g/t, the author suggests using the following formula: 

Capped value = 40 + 0.53(original grade – 40) 
This capping grade will affect only three samples (1.8% of the selected samples) 

and will reduce the total amount of ounces by 3.3%.

14.1.5 Compositing 
Compositing was compiled using the grade of the adjacent material when 

assayed, or a value of zero when not assayed. 
In order to minimize any bias introduced by the variable sample lengths, capped 

gold assays (as determined in previous subsection) were composited to 1.0 meter equal 
lengths (1.0 m composites) within all intervals that define each of the mineralized zones. 
Tails were not created and rather, were distributed over the previous composites. 
14.1.6 Variography  

The author modeled the composite variography considering all the veins as one 
uniform group using Isatis software. The objectives of this step consist of: 

- Characterizing the anisotropy and setting the dimensions and directions of a 
search ellipsoid to use during the interpolation of values of the block model. The 
dimensions of the three axes of the ellipsoid are equal to the range measured on 
the variograms. This way, it is statistically shown that wherever the center of this 
ellipsoid is located, all samples included within it will have a variance inferior to that 
of the entire population. It is reasonable to use this sub selection to estimate the 
value of a central point. The anisotropy may also be used to select and weigh 
samples during the "de-clustering" steps. 

- Defining the Kriging equations. The equations deriving from the variograms are 
required during the Kriging interpolation. These equations take into account the 
nugget effect (C0), the model of dispersion (spherical, exponential), the range and 
the variance in each three axes (σ1, σ2 and σ3). It is common to use more than one 

 75 



 
  
 

model in order to better represent the dispersion (short and long) of each of the 
axes before reaching the level (total variance). 
An omnidirectional variogram was first calculated to estimate the nugget effect 

(C0). Second, 18 directional variograms located in the horizontal plane were then 
calculated. This allows defining the direction of longer continuity (longitudinal direction). 
The next step includes 18 directional variograms set in the vertical plane parallel to the 
longitudinal direction and another 18 directional variograms set in a vertical plan 
perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. And finally 18 directional variograms on an 
inclined plan representing the best plan fit for all mid points (longitudinal plan). This step 
allows having an overview of the variance of the idealized sphere in order to verify the 
presence of a directional anisotropy. 

The variography was very difficult to establish. In fact all structures were hidden by 
only one sample (sample number P174683 with a grade of 94.3 g/t). When this sample 
is removed, the variograms became more clear, not perfect but usable. This study did 
not demonstrate a clear anisotropy. Thus, it was proposed to use an omnidirectional 
variogram as shown to Figure 14.

14.1.8 Block Model Geometry 
A block model was established to cover the entire drilled area. The origins of the 

block model are as follows (center of the front, bottom, left cell): 
Easting:  293250mE   (32 cells x 10 m each) 
Northing:  5330000mN (45 cells x 10 m each) 
Elevation:  -100m (41 cells x 10 m each) 

The block model was not rotated and error on volume calculated from the block 
model compared to the volume estimated from the wireframe is lower than 0.04%. 
14.1.9 Mineralized Zone Block Model 

All blocks with at least 0.001% of their volume falling within a selected solid were 
assigned the corresponding solid vein code. A percent block model was generated 
reflecting the proportion of vein in each block. 
14.1.10 Grade block model 

For each cell identified as within one of the three veins, the grade was estimated 
using only composite from the specific vein (Hard boundary). All estimations were 
completed using a Kriging function based on the variogram presented in Figure 12. 

When four composites can be found within a radius of 50 meters, then the eight 
closest composites (within a search radius of 50 meters) where used for estimating the 
grade of the cell. If the minimum number of composites cannot be found within the first 
search ellipsoid, then the search was extended to 100 meters. Again if a minimum of 
four composites can be found within the second search ellipsoid (100 m) then the eight 
closest points are used for block estimate. All cells, where the minimum number of 
composites cannot be found even within the second search ellipsoid, will stay un-
estimated. 

No other restrictions (octants, parent hole, distance) parameters where used. 
14.1.11 Resource categories 
 The resource classification definitions used for this report are those published by 
the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum in their document "CIM 
Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Reserves". 
Measured Mineral Resource: that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade 
or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can 
be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical 
and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced 
closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 
Indicated Mineral Resource: that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade 
or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of 
confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic 
parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the 
deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing 

 77 



 
  
 

information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological 
and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 
Inferred Mineral Resource: that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 
grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 
sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. 
The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 
Resources from this category should not be used to support mine planning and 
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 

For each cell where the first search ellipsoid was used, the indicated category 
was assigned. For each cell where the second search ellipsoid was used, the inferred 
category was assigned. 

No measured category was assigned to any blocks. 
14.1.12 Minimum cut-off value 

By definition, the Cut Off is the breakeven point considering total cost and 
revenue generated by the operation. The current estimation used the following 
economical parameters. 

- Gold value = 1 450$/ounce 
- Mining cost = 90$/ton (metric) 
- Milling fees = 25$/ton (metric) 
- Gold recovery = 92% 

These parameters give a first estimation of the Cut Off at 2.27 g/t. However, it is 
clear that the parameters do not represent the total cost. Environmental, development, 
administration costs, etc. were not taken into account. One may add 25% to the costs 
previously considered. Doing so will push the estimation of the Cut Off to 3.35 g/t. A Cut 
Off of 3.0 g/t for official estimation is proposed. 

Other cut-off grades were also compiled, but for illustrative purposes only. The 
cut-off grade must be re-evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions and other 
factors, including gold price, exchange rate, mining method, related costs, etc.

14.1.13 Mineral Resource Estimate Results 

Given all parameters listed above, GéoPointCom is of the opinion that the current 
Mineral Resource Estimate can be classified as Indicated and Inferred resources. The 
estimate is compliant with CIM standards and guidelines for reporting mineral resources 
and reserves. 

If we consider 3.0g/t Cut Off, actual estimation will represent 389,400 ton a 6.4 g/t 
(79,550 ounces of gold) in the indicated category and 111,600 ton at 6.9 g/t Au (24,590

14.2 Sixteen Zone 
Estimation was performed from November to December 2013. The database 

used was the same as that used for the last resource estimation in April 2012, except 
that 254 samples were added to fill the gaps in most of the drill holes completed since 
2004. The April 2012 resource estimation includes the last drill holes and takes into 
account SX-11-03. The effective date for the resource estimation of the Sixteen Zone is 
November 18, 2013. 
14.2.1 Methodology 

The Mineral Resource Estimate and geostatistical study detailed in this report 
was performed using Isatis (V. 2013.1) software. The method involves a 3D Block Model 
estimated with an Ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolator on samples selection which is 
strictly constrained to an area of high vein density within a felsic intrusive plug. 
14.2.2 Drill hole sample database 

The Geotic/MS Access diamond drill hole database is maintained and updated by 
Geologica's employees (P.Geo and P.Tech.) under the supervision of Alain-Jean 
Beauregard, P.Geo. and Daniel Gaudreault, P.Eng. It contains 63 surface diamond drill 
holes with conventional analytical gold assay results, as well as coded lithologies from 
the drill core logs. The 63 drill holes cumulate 14,073.6 meters of core, 3,413 samples 
for a total of 2,801.5 meters of core that was saw-cut and assayed. The Database also 
contains 180 QA/QC samples. 
14.2.3 Interpretation of mineralized zones 

The interpretation was completed by Benjamin Blaise, under the supervision of 
Alain-Jean Beauregard and Daniel Gaudreault. In order to conduct accurate resource 
modeling of the Sixteen Zone, the retained option consists of constructing a solid 
wireframe representing an area within the dioritic intrusive where vein density containing 
higher grade is more abundant than the surrounding host the intrusive ("High 
probability Ore") rock unit. 

The wireframe solid was created by digitizing an interpretation onto fifteen (15) 
sections spaced 25 m apart, and then using tie-lines to complete the wireframes 
composed of four (4) closed areas (Figure 15). This wire frame ("High probability Ore") 
was used for selecting all drillhole intersections. Unsampled areas were considered to 
carry a grade of 0.000 g/t gold.

14.2.4 High Grade Capping  

It is common in the industry to remove some of the highest (aberrant) values 
from the assay distribution prior to compositing the samples. The main objective of 
this process is to make sure that the erroneous values could not affect grade 
estimation. With the development of statistical methods for estimating grade, this 
process became less important. In fact, Kriging and especially simulation techniques 
are less sensitive to some very high values. On the other hand, the presence of 
some very high values may make the variogram very difficult to establish. 
Geostatistics provide some efficient tools to overcome this problem. The more 
common methods used to assess the necessity of using a capping value, are listed 
here. 

- The first indication of the necessity to cap high values is the coefficient of 
variation "CV". Ideally, this value should be located close to one. A CV 
superior to two is generally considered an indication of the necessity to cap 
high values. In fact this is highly related to the difficulty to produce a clean 
variogram when CV is very high. 

- In the case of a simple normal or log-normal population, the probability curve 
should form a relatively straight line. A positive break in the upper end is often 
interpreted as an indication requiring a capping of high values. This criterion is 
probably the strongest indication, especially when the interpolation method 
requires a normal or log–normal distribution. 

- The metal factor method consists of comparing the cumulated metal 
percentage with the cumulated data percentage. This technique takes for 
granted that all samples represent an equivalent number of tonnes. Specialists 
generally agree to keep this factor below 10. In other words, there should 
never be more than 10% of ounces in less than 1% of tonnes. This method 
really concentrates on the 1% or 2% superior to the distribution. It is more a 
security factor than a distribution analysis. 

- Especially when the grades of all the intersections are not the most important 
parameters for marking the zone, it is always possible to proceed with a full 
resource estimation using different capping. Then a graph showing the 
percentage of total ounces lost relative to the capping grade used may point 
out a change in the gold distribution. 
Figure 16 and 17 show the distribution (density, histogram, box plot, 

probability plot and the percentage of ounces lost relative to samples capping) of 
gold values for all the samples within the "High probability Ore". From this graph it 
is clear that samples from High probability Ore do not form a simple normal nor log-
normal population. It seems to be a bi-modal distribution. One can propose an 
assemblage of two log-normal populations to explain this distribution. The waste 
population may represent close to 75% of the samples with a median close to 0.1 
and grades ranging from 0.002 to one g/t. In that case the Ore population may have 
a median around five g/t and grade ranging from 0.1 to 70 g/t. The distributions of the 
metal content within the percentile classes show more than 24% of the total metal 

 82 



 
  
 
appearing within 1% of the samples. To satisfy the metal factor methodology, the 
grade must be capped at 15 g/t. This is considered to be too conservative and not 
realistic for the observed bi-modal distribution. According to the graph showing the 
reduction of total ounces relative to capping grade, the author is 
recommending limiting higher gold values at 35 g/t. This capping limit will affect 
six samples, drive the CV to 2.7 and reduce the total amount of gold by 10%. At this 
point we may presume that the high CV will make variography very difficult to 
establish.

14.2.5 Compositing 
In order to minimize the bias introduced by the variable sample lengths, 

capped gold assays (as determined in a previous subsection) were composited to 0.7 
meter equal lengths (0.7m composites) within all intervals that define the High 
probability Ore. Tails were not created and rather were distributed over the previous 
composites. 
14.2.6 Variography  

The composite variography of the High probability Ore was modeled using 
Isatis software. The objectives of this step consist of: 

- Characterizing the anisotropy and setting the dimensions and direction of a 
search ellipsoid to use during the interpolation of values of the block model. The 
dimensions of the three axes of the ellipsoid are equal to the range measured 
on the variograms. This way, it is statistically shown that wherever the center of 
this ellipsoid is located, all samples included within it will have a variance inferior 
to that of the entire population. It is reasonable to use this subselection to 

 84 



 
  
 

estimate the value of a central point. The anisotropy may also be used to select 
and weigh samples during the "de-clustering" steps. 

- Defining the Kriging equations. The equations deriving from the variograms are 
required during the Kriging interpolation. These equations take into account the 
nugget effect (C0), the model of dispersion (spherical, exponential, cubic…), the 
range and the variance in each three axes (σ1, σ2 and σ3). It is frequent to use 
more than one model in order to better represent the dispersion (short and long) 
of each of the axes before reaching the level (total variance). 
An omnidirectional variogram was first calculated to estimate the nugget effect 

(C0).  Second, 18 directional variograms located in the horizontal plane were 
calculated permitting to define the direction of longer continuity (longitudinal 
direction).  The next step includes 18 directional variograms set in the vertical plane 
parallel to the longitudinal direction and another 18 directional variograms set in a 
vertical plan perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, and finally, 18 directional 
variograms on an inclined plan representing the best plan fit for all mid points 
(longitudinal plan). This step allows having an overview of the variance of the 
idealized sphere in order to verify the presence of a directional anisotropy. 

The author was unable to model a clear geometrical anisotropy, thus an 
omnidirectional model was created, where the Nugget effect counts for 78% of the 
total variance; a cubic model with a range of 72 meters was used. 

Figure 18 shows the experimental and model variogram obtained from the 
Sixteen Zone composites.

14.2.7 Bulk Density 

A specific gravity of 2.80 g/cm3 was used to estimate the tonnage for the 2013 
Mineral Resource Estimate. 
14.2.8 Block Model Geometry 

A block model was established to cover the entire drilled area. The origins of 
the block model are as follows (center of the front, bottom, left cell): 
Easting:  292260 m E (20 cells x 10 m each) 
Northing:  5329560 m N (9 cells x 10 m each) 
Elevation:  40 m  (20 cells x 10 m each) 

The block model was not rotated and error on the volume calculated from the 
block model was compared to the volume estimated from the wireframe revealing a 
variation lower than 0.01%. 
14.2.9 Mineralized Zone Block Model 

All blocks with at least 0.001% of their volume falling within a selected solid 
(High probability Ore) were assigned the "in Ore" code. A percent block model was 
generated reflecting the zone proportion in each block. 
14.2.10 Grade block model 

For each cell the grade was estimated using an Ordinary Kriging (OK) 
procedure. The search ellipsoid use to select samples for interpolation was set to a 
radius of 15 meters. This interpolation process required a minimum of five 
composites (the 5five closest) but only the ten closest where retained. Almost all (587 
cells on a total of 614) cells were estimated using these parameters. For the cells 
where the minimum number of composites could not be found, (27 cells of a total of 
614), the radius of the search ellipsoids was extended to 60 meters. 

No other restrictions (octants, parent hole, distance) parameters were used. 
14.2.11 Resource categories 
 The resource classification definitions used for this report are those published 
by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum in their document "CIM 
Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Reserves". 
Measured Mineral Resource: that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established 
that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate 
application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning 
and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade 
continuity. 
Indicated Mineral Resource: that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with 

 86 



 
  
 
a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and 
testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for 
geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 
Inferred Mineral Resource: that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 
grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 
sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. 
The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes. Resources from this category should not be used to support mine planning 
and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 

For each cell where the grade was estimated using the first pass ellipsoid, the 
indicated category was assign. An inferred category was assign to all cells 
estimated with the extended search ellipsoid. No other adjustment was done to this 
classification scheme. 

No measured category was assigned to any blocks. 
 

14.2.12 Minimum cut-off value 
By definition, the Cut Off is the breakeven point considering total cost and 

revenue generated by the operation. The current estimation used the following 
economical parameters. 

- Gold value = 1 450$/ounce 
- Mining cost = 90$/tonne (metric) 
- Milling fees = 25$/tonne (metric) 
- Gold recovery = 92% 

These parameters give a first estimation of the Cut-Off at 2.27 g/t Au. However, 
it is clear that the parameters do not represent total cost. Environmental, 
developmentand administration costs, etc. were not taken into account. We may add 
25% to the cost previously considered. Doing so will push the estimation of the Cut-
Off at 3.35 g/t Au. A Cut-Off at 3.0 g/t Au for official estimation is suggested (see 
Table below). 

Other cut-off grades were also compiled, but for illustrative and comparison 
purposes only. The cut-off grade must be re-evaluated in light of prevailing market 
conditions and other factors: gold price, exchange rate, mining method, related costs, 
etc. 
 
14.2.13 Mineral Resource Estimate Results 

Given all parameters listed above, GéoPointCom is of the opinion that the 
current Mineral Resource Estimate can be classified as Indicated and Inferred 

 87 



 
  
 
resources. The estimate is compliant with CIM standards and guidelines for reporting 
mineral resources and reserves. 

If we consider 3.0 g/t Au Cut-Off, actual estimation will represent 91,700 
tonnes at 5.2 g/t Au (15,440 ounce of gold) in the indicated category and 1,800 
tonnes at 4.2 g/t Au (250 ounce of gold) in the inferred category (figure14.3.12).  
 

 
 
14.2.14 Comparison to previous mineral resource estimates 

Comparing mineral resource estimates may appear to be a simple exercise, 
but in reality, obtaining real conclusions from such comparisons is difficult due to 
differences in key assumptions, parameters and methods and the interaction 
between these features in the final results. 

The historical estimate made by D.R. Scammell in May 1989 is not NI 43-101 
compliant. His estimation was designed for a very selective mining method. The 
volume was estimated with polygon on section and grade was derived from the 
nearest neighbor composited at the midpoint of each intersection. Most of the key 
assumptions are not described in the supporting report. We can only assume that the 
grade was capped at one ounce per ton (34.286 g/t). This could not be compared 
with the current estimation where mining methods and selectivity are too different. 

The last estimation undertaken by GéoPointCom in April 2012 was based on a 
similar method. At that time many gaps (intervals not sampled within ore selection) 
were present from the 2004 drilling campaign. This was corrected within the present 
estimation. The present estimation is also much more selective in respect of High 
Probability Ore. It is also important to mention that in April 2012 Capping was set to 
25 g/t and the Cut-Off used was 2.25 g/t Au. 

If we use the actual data applying a Capping grade of 25 g/t Au and estimate 
the resource with a Cut-Off of 2.25 g/t Au, we will obtain 153,900 tonnes at 3.9 g/t Au 
of indicated Ore (19,120 ounces). Compared to the 227,160 tonnes at 2.87 g/t Au 
(20,949 ounces) previously reported, we can say that the actual estimation is more 

 88 



 
  
 
selective than the previous one. This reflects the fact that the actual estimation was 
designed for a more selective mining method. 

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES (Item 23) 

The production, resource and reserve estimates indicated below are of a historical 
nature and do not comply with NI 43-101. However, the authors believe that this 
information gives a conceptual indication of the potential of the area and that it is 
pertinent to this report. The qualified persons have been unable to verify the 
information and the information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on 
the property that is the subject of the technical report. 

 The Sigma-Lamaque project is located immediately to the north of the 
Lamaque Mine property (see Figure 19). This project is now controlled by the Deutch 
Bank (formerly owned by Century Mining and presently non-operating). The 
resources and reserves on this project include the following:

 Contiguous and south of the Lamaque property, a group of mining claims 
called the Airport property (now the Alexis Option), is owned by Aur Resources 
(optioned by Alexandria Minerals) which hosts auriferous mineralization associated 
with quartz and quartz-carbonate veins and veinlets. The most significant results 
found are 3.43 g Au/tonne over a length of 6.1 m and 6.65 g Au/tonne over 1.2 m 
(MRNQ File # GM-43367). Also reported are results of 1.24% Zn and 6.86 g Au/t 
over 0.76 m (MRNQ File # GM-50650).

Contiguous with and east of the Lamaque property boundary, the seven-claim 
Aumaque property owned by Century is underlain by intermediate to felsic tuffs with 
some diorite and feldspar porphyry dykes and sills from the Val-d'Or Formation. 
Mineralization consists of auriferous quartz-pyrite-sphalerite-chalcopyrite-gold-silver 
veins hosted within an ENE-WSW vertical shear zone. In 1988 an Inferred Resource 
of 180,894 tonnes grading 8.57 g Au/t was reported (ref: MRNQ Deposit File # 
32C04-0063). Since that time, more work has been conducted; however, the 
resource has not yet been confirmed. 

To the West is the Goldex Mine owned by Agnico-Eagle reporting 3,500,000 
gold ounces in resources and reserves and directly to the west of Goldex there is the 
Osisko Canadian Malartic open pit gold mine reporting 10.71 million Proven and 
Probable gold ounces. The adjoining Cadillac, Malartic and Val-d'Or camps have 
produced over 45 million ounces of gold since the 1930s and presently encompass 
seven producing gold mines (15 million ounces in reserves). 

16.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION (Item 24) 
 The Lamaque property produced gold for 60 years (1924 to 1984), and there 
still remains work to verify, consult, and validate, including documents and data files 
kept at Integra's Vancouver Office. 
 To the best of Geologica's knowledge there is no other relevant data or 
information that pertains to this report on the Lamaque property. 

17.0 INTERPRETATION, CONCEPT AND CONCLUSIONS (Item 25) 
Geologica considers that the Lamaque property has excellent potential for 

further discoveries of economic gold mineralization and that the fundamental control 
on mineralization is structural and associated with young or late intrusive plugs, 
dykes and sills of felsic to mafic composition. Increasing knowledge of the details of 
the property-scale controls and structures will help orient and focus future drilling 
programs. Geologica believes that Integra should continue to refine its understanding 
of the structural complexity to help interpret and define potentially mineralized shear 
and fault structures, both cross cutting and parallel to stratigraphy. The magnetic 
data should help identify the presence of altered fractured intrusions of felsic to mafic 
composition. Thereafter, follow-up exploration, surveys, prospecting and drilling 
should be conducted. 
 Geologica believes that significant exploration potential exists on Triangle, 
Mylamaque, Sixteen, No. 6 Vein, No. 4 Plug, No. 5 Plug as well as No. 3 Mine areas. 
Some definition drilling is warranted to categorize resources and test for lateral and 
depth extensions of these already recognized mineralized zones. 
 

The 2012-2013 Mineral Resource Estimates herein were performed by 
Christian D'Amours, P.Geo. (OGQ # 226) from GéoPointCom, using all available 
results as per the effective date of each zone. The estimates are based on the data 
validation and the geological interpretation of the mineralized zones by Geologica. 
These resource estimates are part of a 43-101 compliant report prepared and 

 91 



 
  
 
supervised by Geologica Inc. in collaboration with GéoPointCom (Mr. Christian 
D'Amours Geol. M.Sc.). The effective dates of the Mineral Resource Estimates vary 
from zone to zone but the published dates, by press release, is September 25, 2013 
and January 28, 2014.  

 
In November and December 2013 Mineral Resource Estimates herein were 

completed by Christian D'Amours, P.Geo. (OGQ # 226) from GéoPointCom, using all 
available results as per the effective date for two new zones (No. 6 Vein and Sixteen 
Zone). The mineral resources presented herein, and disclosed in this technical 
report, are not mineral reserves since they have no demonstrable economic viability. 
The result of the study is Mineral Resource Estimates for these two new mineralized 
zones with Indicated and Inferred Resources. The effective date of the Mineral 
Resource Estimates by press release is January 28, 2014.

18.0 RECOMMENDATIONS (Item 26) 

Geologica considers that the fundamental controls of the mineralization on the 
Lamaque property are structural and recommends that the structural interpretation to 
define potentially mineralized shear and fault structures, cross cutting and parallel to 
stratigraphy, be continued and refined. A comprehensive digital database which is 
already in place needs to be continuously updated and compiled. Compilation of all 
drillhole information including surface exploration surveys, geology, assay results and 
all technical surveys will continue. 

Geologica believes more exploration and definition drilling is warranted to 
better define and test for lateral and at depth extensions of the known zones and to 
explore for other mineralized zones in the hosting structures. Effective exploration to 
advance the No. 5 Plug and No. 3 Mine will require deep drilling validation and 
definition drillholes. Complementary drilling on the Triangle and South Triangle Zones 
to evaluate the depth and lateral extensions of the recent lenses identified during 
2013 is also warranted. 
 As previously mentioned, with the expansion of the known resources, 
combined with future upgrading of historical resources on other zones and those 
zones awaiting compilation and validation, Geologica believes that potential exists for 
the Lamaque property to host more than 1.5 million ounces of gold resources. 
Identifying this potential could be accomplished through a multi-phase exploration 
program. 

Geologica believes that the Lamaque property merits further exploration and 
the proposed exploration plans are properly conceived and justified. 
Future Resource Estimates 

• Resource calculations and updates for the Parallel, Triangle, South Triangle, 
Fortune, No. 5 Plug and No. 3 Mine will be completed once the drillhole assay 
results are available, validated and verified. 

 93 



 
  
 

• Several other historical and more recently discovered and recognized 
mineralized structures remain to be drill tested, evaluated and validated. Some 
areas contain historic resource estimates that would require confirmation 
drilling in order to bring them into an NI 43-101 status; see the following table 
for detail.

The production, resource and reserve estimates, indicated above, are of historical

information gives a conceptual indication of the potential of the area and that it is 
pertinent to this report. The qualified persons have been unable to verify the 
information and the information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on 
the property that is the subject of the technical report. 
 
18.1 Budget 

In order to adequately advance Integra's Lamaque property, Geologica 
recommends a budget totalling $8,570,000. The objectives are: 

1) Complete pre-feasibility stage geological, engineering & environmental 
studies; 

2) Advance the project to feasibility stage; 
3) Increase confidence level of existing resources; and 
4) Test extensions and exploration targets with the objective of increasing 

total ounces. 
The outlined program will: 

a) Focus on the follow-up surface definition drilling of known mineralized 
zones located both within the north and south clusters for a total of 40,000 
m. This will help convert resource categories to higher confidence levels 
and possibly add to the resource base. 

b) Test the extensions of some of the existing deposits in order to increase 
the resource base (included in the 40,000 m drilling program from part (a)).
