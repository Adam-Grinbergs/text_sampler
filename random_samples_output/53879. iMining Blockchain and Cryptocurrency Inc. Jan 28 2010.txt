SUMMARY 

Parlane Resource Corp. (the "Company") announced in a news release dated November 5,2009 that it had 

entered into an option agreement with Minera Zeppy, SA de C.V. (Zeppy) to acquire an interest in the 

Chacala silver-gold property. 

The Chacala property is located in Durango State, approximately 142 km by road from the city of Culiacan 

(Figure 1 and 3). It consists of a block of mostly contiguous exploration and exploitation concessions located 

around the village of Chacala and referred to in this report as the Chacala property. The Chacala property 

consists of thirteen mineral concessions totalling 11,453 ha: Mina del Otatal, Ampliaci6n del Otatal, L1uvia de 

Oro, Los Chapotes, Los Chapotes Fracc.2, Candelaria, Valeria, Melisa, Los Chacalotes, Los Chacalotes 

Fracc. 2, Los Chacalotes Fracc. 3, San Marcos, and Carolina. 

On the Chacala property the mineral rights (to the different parts of the property) belong to Exploraciones 

Mineral del Tambor, SA de C.V., Manuel Beltran Meza, Eduardo Alfonso Navaro Contreras, Jose Augustin 

Garcia Garcia, and Eduardo Alfonso Navaro Contreras (Table 1). The closest expiry date for any of the 

Chacala mineral claims is December 18, 2041. 

All the above mentioned mineral property owners are represented by Minera Zeppy, SA de C.V. (Zeppy) and 

Jose Augustin Garcia Garcia who entered into an option agreement with Parlane Resource Corp. 

The surface rights to the Chacala property belong to the local owners. The mineral claim holders obtained 

verbal permission from the individual property owners to access and conduct exploration activity on their land. 

To conduct future exploration work there has to be an official agreement with local property owners and a 

water use permit should be acquired prior to drilling. 

The Chacala property is located in the metallogenic Au-Ag belt of the NW Sierra Madre Occidental known for 

hosting deposits like Dolores, Mulatos, Moris, Topia, La Cienega, Basis, Santa Matia del Oro, Guadelupe de 

los Reyes, Rosario (Plomosa mine), San Dimas, and Toyalita. 

The property is underlain by a metamorphic Jurassic (?) basement rock consisting of flysch type meta­

sandstones and -mudstones overlain by the Triassic andesite (Lower Volcanic Series) and rhyolite (Upper 

Volcanic Series) volcanic sequences of Sierra Madre Occidental and subsequently overlain by younger 

Tertiary volcanics and alluvia. Cretaceous granodiorites and andesite dikes have intruded the above 

mentioned volcaniclastic complex. 

Mineralization on the Chacala property is principally structurally controlled and mainly hosted in intrusive rocks 

and less commonly in andesite volcanics and metasediments. It is possible that in some locations 



2
 

mineralization could form mantos and disseminated ore bodies. The majority of structures on the Chacala 

property have NW-SE or NE-SW trend. 

Detector Exploraciones S.A de C. V. has performed exploration work on the Chacala property on behalf of 

Zeppy during 2009. Detector Exploraciones identified four distinct exploration targets: Candelaria, San Juan ­

EI Oro, Otatal, and Nortefia, All the above mentioned target areas were mapped and field geological 

observations were compared and merged with available regional geological data. Rock chip samples were 

collected across the structures of the main identified showings and sent for analysis. Only the Candelaria 

structure was explored in detail with a total of 270 meters of trench being excavated using a small back hoe. 

A total of 158 mandays were spent on the trenching, mapping, rock sampling, and prospecting. In total of 235 

samples were collected from the property by Detector Exploraciones of which 80 have been assayed 

(Table 2a and Table 2b). Minera Zeppy reports that in addition to $80,000 which was spent acquiring 

additional claims, some $160,000 was spent on geological work, with a further $40,000 in expenditures on 

road maintenance and another $20,000 on geological consulting. 

To date, four distinct exploration targets have been identified: Candelaria, San Juan - EI Oro, Otatal, and 

Nortefia. Mineralization on the Chacala property appears to be principally structurally controlled, and rock 

samples collected by the authors from the identified targets revealed the presence of significant silver-gold 

mineralization. Silver and gold mineralization is commonly associated with the presence of strongly anomalous 

As, Pb, Zn, and Cu. 

Since 1991 the Chacala property has been explored by various groups including Luismin, Pefioles, Kobex, 

Saddlerock, Hochschild, Kinross, and Minera Mexicana Sombrerete. It appears that no systematic exploration 

has occurred on the property and none of the targets have been drill tested. 

Candelaria Target 

The Candelaria target is over 800m long, has azimuth 040 degrees, and dips approximately 80 degrees to the 

SE. Only 100m of the total strike length of this target was mined and explored from 4 mining levels located 

approximately 22m below each other (Candelaria mine) to a depth of less than 80m and through a total of 

approximately 430m of underground workings. Recent trenching by Detector Exploraciones across 

approximately 700m of the southwestern extension of the La Candelaria vein indicated that the target zone is 

forming over 15m wide zone with several sub-parallel veins locally up to 2m wide. 

The most anomalous assay result obtained by the authors at Candelaria was 1.7m grading 1.7 glt gold and 46 

glt silver. Silver and gold mineralization in Candelaria is associated with the presence of white quartz, 

tourmaline, and the mineralized structure is hosted in a granodiorite intrusion. 



3
 

San Juan and EI Oro Targets 

The EI Oro and San Juan targets are probably controlled by two different structures cross cutting at low angle 

but the combined length of EI Oro and San Juan structures can be presently estimated at approximately 

300m. The trend of the San Juan structure is 325/44NE, and the EI Oro structure appears to trend at 

270/40NE. Although these vein attitudes are similar the mineralization seen in the assay results from the two 

locations is quite different. The trace of the structures was not followed up by the authors. 

The San Juan structure has a reported limited historical production of silver and gold extracted from 4 mining 

levels, the mining activity was reportedly suspended in the early 1990's. At the EI Oro, there is the 

appearance of horizontal tension veins sub-parallel to the main EI Oro vein hosted in fragmental rocks andlor 

breccias. In these locations there is the potential for greater mining thicknesses. All samples collected by the 

authors from the San Juan and EI Oro targets returned highly anomalous assay results. The most significant 

sample from San Juan target is 0.8m grading 68.95 glt gold and 140 glt silver, and from the EI Oro target 

0.8m with 1.33 glt gold, 557 glt silver, 6.8 % zinc, and 11.1% lead. 

Otatal Target 

The Otatal target forms a prominent outcrop consisting of an up to 8m wide siliceous structure, hosted in a 

granodiorite intrusion. The Otatal structure was traced by the authors for approximately 60m. The structure 

trends at 014/80E and the strength of silicification suggests a much larger, regional extent of the EI Otatal 

structural target. One 8-m deep shaft is the only indication of past mining activity. 

The most anomalous assay result obtained by the authors at Otatal is 0.7m grading 4.26 glt gold, 131 glt 

silver. and 2.5% lead. A hilly topography and mineralization resistant to weathering make Otatal a relatively 

easy target for exploration. 

Norteiia Target 

The Norteiia mineralization appears to be controlled by structures cross cutting conglomerates and breccias. It 

is possible that the mineralized structures cross cut the clastic (or brecciated) host rock and form a 

disseminated low-grade mineralization or mantos. Lack of underbush in some upper parts of the Norteiia 

target indicates possible presence of disseminated sulphides in rock. This observation supports the possible 

existence of disseminated sulphide mineralization on this target. 

Recommendations 

A two phase exploration program is recommended to quickly evaluate the property. The targets include 

structurally controlled quartz veins, stockworks, and breccias with Ag-Au mineralization often with elevated Cu­

Pb-Zn-As as well as disseminated Au-Ag mineralization in a host rock. The Phase 1 program should include 

building access roads, preparation of orthophoto and digital topographic maps, geological mapping, 



4 

geochemical sampling, trenching, petrographic and fluid inclusion studies, ground magnetic and IP-resistivity 

surveys (possibly NSAMT). The work is estimated to cost approximately US$260,000. 

Contingent on the success of Phase I, a Phase II exploration program is recommended which would include 

2,000 metres of diamond drilling. Drill targets tested in Phase II would have been developed in Phase I, the 

total cost of which is estimated at US$820,000 including a 20% contingency due to the difficult access. The 

total estimate for the two phases of exploration is $1.08 million. 

INTRODUCTION 

At the request of Robert Eadie, President of Parlane Resource Corp., the authors visited the property between 

September 11 and 15, 2009 accompanied by Hector Duran Garcia and Victor Manuel Luna Castillo, both of 

Detector Exploraciones SA de C.V. representing Minera Zeppy, SA de C.v. The most recent work done on 

the property was during 2009 by Detector Exploraciones who conducted mapping, rock sampling, and 

prospecting programs over the entire property and trenching of the Candelaria structure for Minera Zeppy. 

On September 11, 2009 the authors examined the surface sampling of trenches from the Candelaria vein 

system. On September 13, 2009 the authors walked out and sampled the El Oro - San Juan vein systems. On 

September 14,2009 the authors visited and sampled the Otatal structural target, and on September 15 the 

Norteiia area. This report describes the exploration history and geology of the Chacala property and makes 

recommendations for further work. This report has been prepared to support the acquisition of the property 

and will also be used to support required filing with any Canadian regulatory authorities. 

The material found in this technical report is based on the property examination conducted by the authors and 

a compilation of Detector Exploraciones 2009 report, program updates, consultant reports, and corporate 

press releases available for review. There were no limitations put on the authors in preparation of this report. 

The authors have relied on the data contained in this report, namely Detector Exploraciones SA de C.V. 

technical report dated July 2009 (Informe de La Primera Etapa de Los Trabajos Realizados en el Proyecto 

"Chacala, Mpio. Tamazula, estado de Durango. Por: Detector Exploraciones SA de C.V., Junio 2009). 

Therefore, in writing this technical paper the authors have relied on the truth and accuracy of the sources 

presented to them which are listed in the Reference section of this report but have also performed checks 

against historical data in order to provide verification of the data.

The Chacala property consists of a block of mostly contiguous exploration and exploitation concessions 

located around the village of Chacala and referred to in this report as the Chacala property. The Chacala 

property consists of thirteen mineral concessions totalling 11,453 ha (Table 1). 

In Mexico, the location of a concession is determined by the location of a single claim monument, with all 

corners being located based on surveyed distances and bearings from that monument. These distances and 

bearings must be determined and verified by a licensed surveyor. The monument may be placed outside of 

the claim boundaries. Although the perimeter lines may not have been partially or entirely surveyed, the 

method of locating the claim corners constitutes a legal survey. 

A summary of the claim tenure information is located in Table 1. Title to the Chacala property claims has been 

reviewed and verified by the management of Parlane Resource Corp. and a legal title opinion is located in 

Appendix 1. The claims that comprise the Chacala property are shown in Figure 2. The closest expiry date for 

any of the Chacala mineral claims is December 18,2041.

Note: 1 - Fees are due to the government twice a year, in January and in July. The "Annual Fee" column is 

the sum of both payments in US dollars. Fees are based on the number of hectares comprising the 

concession and the date of issue of the concession title, and are accrued in Mexican Pesos, which in the table 

above have been converted to US dollars at the exchange rate of 13.00 pesos per US dollar. The total fees for 

2009 rise to approximately US$26,000. 

There are no surface rights associated with the Chacala property, small parcels of surface rights belong to 

individual local owners. The mineral claim holders obtained verbal permission from the individual property 

owners to access and conduct exploration activity on their land. To conduct future exploration work there has 

to be an official agreement with local property owners and a water use permit should be acquired prior to 

drilling. 

,On the Chacala property four distinct mineralized zones have been identified: Candelaria, San Juan - EI Oro, 

Otatal, and Nortefia, The Candelaria, Jan Juan - EI Oro mineralized zones are located in the central-eastern 

side of the property, the Otatal mineralized zone is located in the north-western side of the property and 

Nortefia mineralizd zone is located in the south-western side of the property. None of the mineralized zones on 

the Chacala property have a verified resources or reserves that would meet 43-101 standards. In all four 

zones (Candelaria, San Juan - EI Oro, Otatal, and Nortena) several historical workings have been identified. 

The most extensive are located in the Candelaria and San Jose and EI Oro target areas. 

Due to limited historical exploration data available, it is impossible to predict if the mineralized zones, specially 

the Otatal and Nortefia, extend beyond the Chacala property boundary. 

No waste deposits, or tailing ponds have been identified on the property. At San Juan an underground train 

rails indicate the use of the mechanical equipment at this mine.

Figure 2. Chacala Property - Tenure Map 

To conduct future exploration work there has to be an official agreement with local property owners and a 

water use permit should be acquired prior to drilling. Neither of these permits are expected to be onerous to 

obtain. 

In a news release dated November 5,2009, Parlane Resource Corp. (the "Company") announced that it had 

entered into an option agreement with Minera Zeppy, SA de C.V. (Zeppy) and Jose Augustin Garcia Garcia 

to acquire an interest in the Chacala gold-silver property. 



9
 

Under the terms of the option agreements, the Company can earn 90% right and interest in the Chacala 

property by paying; (i) to ZEPPY a total of US$1,250,000.00 (one million two hundred and fifty thousand 

dollars 00/100 currency of the United States of America), plus the required 15% Mexican Value Added Tax 

(IVA)and (ii) to Garcia US$250,000. In addition to the cash payments Parlane will issue a total of 3,320,000 

(three million twenty thousand) common shares of Parlane ("Parlane Shares"). The cash payments and 

Parlane Shares are scheduled to be issued on or before 18 months after completing the regulatory 

requirements of the transaction ("Closing"). 

In addition to the cash payments and share issuance, Parlane must incur in US$10,000,000 to fully earn their 

interest in the Mining Concessions. 

ZEPPY shall retain a 3% fully assignable NSR royalty on each of 4 exploration projects. Parlane or its Mexican 

subsidiaries shall have the option, within the first 5 years of the option agreement, to purchase up to 2 

percentage points of the NSR royalty for each of the exploration projects by paying the amount of 

$US1,000,000 for each 1 percentage point of each of the exploration projects. Subsequent to the first five 

years of the option agreement, the NSR buyout will increase to $US1,500,000 for each percentage point of 

each of the exploration projects. There is no royalty on the L1uvia de Oro concession 

Minera Zeppy, SA de C.V. and its subsidiary companies have warranted that the claims: 

•	 are validly issued in the names of Exploraciones Mineras del Tambor, SA de C.V., Manuel 

Coronel Beltran, Manuel Beltran Meza, Jose Agustin Garcia Garcia, and Eduardo Alfonso 

Navarro Contreras. 

•	 are in good standing; 

•	 have no outstanding work orders or legal actions pending; 

•	 are properly located and recorded; 

•	 are not subject to any litigation that Minera Zeppy, SA de C.V. are aware of; 

•	 are free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. 

•	 have no known environmental liabilities that Minera Zeppy, SA de C.V.are aware of. 

Title to the concessions constituting the Chacala property has been reviewed by management of Parlane 

Resource Corp. who take responsibility for its accuracy (Appendix 1). 

ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

Access to the Chacala property from Culiacan City is via paved Highway driving northeast to the town of 

Chapotan (via Tamazula, approximately a 2-hour drive). From this point a gravel road leads southeast to the 

village of Chacala located approximately in the centre of the concession (approximately a 2-hour drive). A 

straight-line distance between Culiacan and Chacala is approximately 65 km. The total distance by road is 

approximately 142 km, of which approximately 112 km is paved and approximately 30 km is gravel road. The 

total travel time from Culiacan to the village of Chacala is approximately 4 hours.

Figure 3. Chacala Property - Access Map 

The Chacala property lies on the western side of Sierra Madre Occidental. It is limited to the east by the 

Uplands with Basin and Range provinces and to the west is bounded by the Buried Range province. In the 

Durango area the basins have elevations of 1900m to 2100m, and the higher peaks rise to 3000m. The 

climate is generally dry with sporadic, often violent rainstorms in the hot summer months. The average 

precipitation in the property area is about 600 mm mainly between May and October. The winter months are 

cool and dry; snow is rare but night-time temperatures approaching the freezing mark are common in the 

higher elevations. Yearly average temperatures are about 25 degrees Celsius. Grasses, small trees and 

shrubs along with several varieties of cacti make up most of the vegetation on the steep hillsides, and larger 

trees are found near springs and streams. 

The Chacala property area is not densely populated and mostly undeveloped. Both the quality of 

infrastructure and population density increases towards the city of Tamazula and Culiacan. There is 11OV 

electrical power in the village of Chacala serviced by a commercial electrical grid, however industrial service 

might need additional grid infrastructure. Any of the materials and supplies required to support exploration 

and mining activities are available in Culiacan, Tamazula and Durango City. Labour needed to support 

exploration and mining activities can be available locally but skilled labour would probably need to be sourced 

in Culiacan, Tamazula or Durango. Public telephone service is available in the town of Chacala and apparently 

there is an Internet access in a local Chacala school (not verified by the authors). 

No environmental reports were provided for the property presumably due to the early stage of exploration of 

the property. The property has ample land suitable for the construction of any proposed mine or mill 

structures and facilities, including tailings storage or waste disposal areas and heap leach pads. Surface rights 



are owned primarily by Manuel Beltran Meza and several small property owners. Permission for access to 

mineral concessions for exploration and possible development must be negotiated with the surface property 

owners which is normally not a problem in Mexico. The writers had casual encounters with various property 

owners during their visit and the property owners appear amenable to exploration and development at this 

time, but no formal negotiations have been initiated (verbal information). 

Some of the small streams on the property carry sufficient water for mining operations at the time of the site 

visit during the rainy season. These streams are much smaller at the end of the dry season however some of 

them are reported to run all year and there should be the opportunity to drill wells to provide additional water. 

There are no water rights associated with the property at this time. 

HISTORY 

For the last 80 years most of the mines in the Chacala district have been inactive. Exceptions are EI Cobre 

and El Porvenir mines (located on a different concession not currently a part of the Chacala property) which 

have seen limited production and the San Juan mine which operated briefly but ceased production in 

approximately 1990 (personal communication with Mr. Manuel Beltran Meza). The CRM Durango reports that 

in total roughly 150,000 tonnes were produced from these mines. 

Since 1991 the Chacala property has been explored by various groups including Luismin, Peiioles, Kobex, 

Saddlerock, Hochschild, Kinross, and Minera Mexicana Sombrerete. Although most of these groups appear to 

have performed only cursory prospecting programs, the authors have located some reports which detail more 

extensive sampling programs along some of the known structures. 

Mining in the early 1900's at the Candelaria mine extracted roughly 100m of the total strike length of this vein 

from 4 mining levels located approximately 22m below each other (Candelaria mine) to a total depth of less 

than 80m with approximately 430m of underground workings. Based on the historical mine level plans and 

sections, it is assumed that the vein had an azimuth of 040 degrees and a dip approximately 65-70 degrees to 

the NE. A crude estimate of production based on long section area and thickness at the mine entrance is that 

50,000 tonnes were mined, no reliable reports of the grade of mineralization has been found by the authors. 

The Candelaria structure has been explored in the past by Minera Mexicana Sombrerete SA de C.V. and 

Peiioles. Samples collected by Minera Mexicana Sombrerete SA de C.v. ranged from 0.1 to 6.2 glt Au and 

19.1 to 81.7 glt Ag and Peiioles sampies (7 sampies) ranged from 0.12 to 109 glt Au and 4.7 to 395 glt Ag 

(information is based on partial report by Minera Mexicana Sombrerete). 

The San Juan mine was in sporadic production of gold and silver until the early 1990's (personal 
) 

communication with the property owner Mr. Manuel Beltran Meza). San Juan mine information is based on 

mine plans included in an undated partial report by Minera Mexicana Sombrerete. The vertical section in the 

San Juan report shows 4 mining levels with roughly 400 meters of total length and indicates the presence of 

unmined mineralized blocks and proposes limits to the economic mineralization. The total vertical depth of 



12 

this mine is approximately 60 metres but the workings were not accessible during the site visit and 

consequently the authors are unable to verify the accuracy of this plan however the location of the shafts and 

adit seem to be correct. 

The EI Oro Mine is assumed to have been worked coincident with the San Juan mine, it has some 

underground development and an unknown historical production. At the present time only the first few meters 

of the mine are accessible. Based on conversations with local people the El Oro mine has two levels of 

approximately 300m in total length. The presence of railway tracks disappearing under rock rubble are 

presumed to indicate the entrance to the lowest level of the EI Oro mine upon a significant waste rock dump. 

The authors have not located any readable mine plans for the El Oro structure. 

The Otatal target has one shallow (approximately 8m deep verbal information from Mr. Manuel Beltran Meza) 

flooded shaft located at the base of the main showing, a partial report provided by the property owner indicates 

that numerous samples were taken across the structure over 500 meters reported by H.L. King P. Eng. of 

Kobex in 1997. In general the samples carry gold, silver and base metal values. Many of the samples contain 

more than 1.5 glt Au with 40-120 glt Ag over thicknesses of 3 to 20 meters. The best samples reported are 11 

glt Au and 134 glt over 2m near the short shaft and 3.1 glt Au and 63 glt Ag over 4.6 meters. The worst 

sample shown on the plan is 0.75 glt Au and 22 glt Ag at the very north of the exposure but the authors can 

not be certain that other lower values were not also omitted. 

Additional work on the Otatal target has been performed by Perioles and Hochschild. Perioles collected 28 

samples with one sample returning 17.6 glt Au and 200 glt Ag and the rest less than 1.86 glt Au and 108 glt 

Ag. Hochschild collected 27 samples with assay value ranging from detection limit to 2.37 glt Au and detection 

limit to 70 glt Ag. Although the exact date of sampling by Perioles and Hochschild at the Otatal target is 

unknown, it appears to have been done in the last few years. The map contained in the Minera Mexicana 

Sombrerete (not dated) report shows the rough location of the samples collected by Perioles and Hochschild 

all of which seem to have been collected from a very small area near the main Otatal showing (information 

based on the map in the undated Minera Mexicana Sombrerete report). The results obtained by all historical 

samples appear to be relatively similar. 

The Norteria target has several underground workings and small"taunas" (small grinding basins) in the 

stream beds but there is no information available regarding production from this area and none of the 

workings were accessible during the site visit, as our guides were unaware of them. Significant exploration of 

this area was conducted by Luismin (date of Luismin activity is unknown to the authors and the information 

was provided subsequent to the site visit in a partial report written by Minera Mexicana Sombrerete). Luismin 

identified two principal targets in the Norteria area; the first target is a 500m long La Guadalupana-La Platosa 

structure, and the second target represents disseminated mineralization within an area 160m by 250m. One of 

the maps indicates a soil (rock) sampling grid that covers an area of approximately 300m by 500m. These two 



13
 

targets were not visited by the authors. Mineralization indicated in the report acknowledges presence of gold, 

silver, lead and zinc as well as mercury and arsenic. 

GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

The Chacala property is located in the province of Sierra Madre Occidental and in a subprovince of Gran 

Meseta and Canones Duranguenses (Figure 4). 

Regional geology is underlined by Jurassic basement rocks overlain by andesitic Triassic andesitic 

volcaniclastic and dacitic volcanic sequences subsequently overlain by younger Tertiary rock formations. The 

above mentioned rock units were intruded by the Cretaceous granodiorite and andesite intrusions (Figure 5). 

Figure 4. Sierra Madre Occidental and Regional Mines and Projects 

The metasedimentary and volcaniclastic complex of Sierra Madre Occidental has been intruded by 

Cretaceous granodiorites and andesite dikes. The 'basin and range' topography reflects a series of N to NW 

trending regional linear grabens bounded by normal faults along the range fronts. Block faulting down the 

steep slopes of the Sierra is also a common phenomenon in the region. 



14
 

The oldest exposed rocks at the Chacala property are metamorphic basement rock (Jurassic-?) consisting of 

flysch type meta-sandstones and -mudstones. The metasedimentary basement rocks are overlain by the 

Triassic andesitic volcaniclastics belonging to the Lower Volcanic Series (volcanico superior) subsequently 

overlain by the rhyolithic Upper Volcanic Series (volcanico superior). The younger Tertiary volcanics and 

alluvia overlie all the above mentioned rock units. The metasedimentary and volcaniclastic complex of Sierra 

Madre Occidental has been intruded by Cretaceous granodiorites and andesite dikes (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Chacala Geology 

The sequence of rhyolite ignimbrites, breccias and tuffs belonging to the Upper Volcanic Series, normally 

found overlying the andesite sequences of Lower Volcanic Series, is not exposed well in the Chacala area. 

The Upper Volcanic Series is probably present at the Otatal target. 

At Candelaria mineralized structures are hosted in a granodiorite intrusion. At Otatal the main mineralized 

structure is hosted at the contact (?) of granodiorite intrusion and metasediment. At EI Oro the host rock for 



15
 

mineralized structures is a brecciated volcaniclastic and at San Juan probably a vesicular flow. The Norteiia 

project is underlain by metasediments mainly represented by fine-grained black siltstone interbedded or 

possibly overlain by a conglomerate. The conglomerate can be divided into two types. One type of 

conglomerate contains white rhyolitic subrounded fragments up to 10cm in diameter and fragments of black 

metasediment within metasedimentary sandy matrix. The second type of conglomerate is lacking rhyolitic 

fragments. The presence of rhyolitic fragments can indicate that this rock unit could be on top of the 

stratigraphical sequence and could represent the first volcanic activity after the clastic sedimentary period. 

Bedding measured in the upper part of the property was 120/84S indicating that at least in some parts of the 

property bedding is almost vertical. In the top part of the visited area, presence of quartzite and breccias with 

quartzite fragments have been identified by the authors. 

DEPOSIT TYPES 

The Chacala property is considered to be a silver-gold epithermal vein target. Low sulphidation vein systems 

are commonly characterised by their low sulphide contents, quartz-adularia-sericite alteration mineralogy, and 

lack of extensive wall-rock alteration. The classic idealised model for these systems, as proposed by 

Buchanan (1981), incorporates a system of sub-vertical veins that passes upwards into a mushroom-shaped 

sub-horizontal "silica cap" at or near the paleosurface (Figure 6). Deep in the system, the veins have relatively 

low precious metal to base metal ratios, but this ratio increases higher in the system to the point where base 

metal sulphides and pyrite are often present in only minor amounts. In some cases, such as the famous 

Comstock Lode in Nevada, the veins contain high grade or "bonanza" sections with elevated silver or silver­

gold grades. The highest levels in the system, including the "silica cap", commonly have anomalous mercury, 

arsenic and antimony geochemistry with low precious and base metal values. 

The geology and style of mineralization at Chacala are similar to those of other silver producing districts in the 

western Americas. Mexico is home to many silver-gold districts that are discussed in the "Adjacent 

Properties" section of this report and is second to only Peru in world silver production. The following 

discussion is intended to provide examples of mining districts that have geology and mineralization that are 

similar in general style to those at the Chacala property. There is no intention to draw direct comparisons 

between Chacala and any other mining districts or properties. The authors have been unable to verify the 

below mentioned information and this information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the 

Chacala property that is the subject of this technical report.

In Mexico, the Topia, Guadalupe y Calvo and Tayoltita districts have numerous mineralized veins hosted in the 

older volcanic rocks underlying the rhyolitic Sierra Madre Occidental ignimbrite "cap". Guadalupe y Calvo is 

somewhat unusual, with a low silver to gold ratio of 20:1. The veins in this district have produced more than 

two million tons of ore. Topia is a classic polymetallic fissure vein district. It has a rich production history with 

recorded production since 1950 of 1.3 million tonnes of ore, yielding 15.4 million ounces of silver with roughly 

18,500 ounces of gold. Combined lead and zinc grades at Topia are almost 8%. The authors have been 

unable to verify the above mentioned information and this information is not necessarily indicative of the 

mineralization on the Chacala property that is the subject of this technical report. 

The Tayoltita mine in the San Dimas district, located approximately 170 km east of the Chacala property, has 

a historic silver to gold ratio of about 80 t0100:1 and production of roughly 30 million tons from over 80 veins. 

The three deposits in the San Dimas district (Tayoltita, Santa Rita and San Antonio) are high grade, low 

sulphidation, and silver-gold-epithermal vein deposits characterized by adularia-sericitic alteration. The proven 

and probable mineral reserves at San Dimas district three operating mines (Tayoltita, Santa Rita and San 

Antonio) are reported to be approximately 3.25 million tonnes at 421 glt Ag. The total inferred mineral 

resources at the three mines, diluted, are reported to be approximately 17.27 million tonnes at an estimated 

grade of 321 glt Ag (Silver Wheaton Corp. 2009 News Release). The authors have been unable to verify the 

above mentioned information and this information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the 

Chacala property that is the subject of this technical report. 

The Fresnillo silver mining district in Zacatecas State contains many high-silver vein deposits. One of the 

larger, classic veins of this camp is the Santo Nino vein. This mineralized vein is not well exposed at surface; 



17
 

instead, at surface there is a small stockwork of small veins and veinlets that may define the vein at depth. 

The Santo Nino vein was discovered by drilling at a depth of 300m below the surface and has now been 

traced for 2.5 km in length and 500m in depth with a vein width of 0.1-4.0 m. (average 2.5 m). The initial 

discovery hole in 1975 intersected 1,087 gft silver, 1.62 gft gold 0.4% lead and 0.7% zinc over a true width of 

3.0 m. This vein has become the largest silver producer in the Fresnillo camp, 1988 reserves of 1.2 million 

tonnes 769gft silver, 0.56gft gold, 0.99% zinc, 0.50% lead and 0.03% copper (Gemmel et ai, 1988). The 

authors have been unable to verify the above mentioned information and this information is not necessarily 

indicative of the mineralization on the Chacala property that is the subject of this technical report. 

There are three prominent silver-gold districts in the central Andes of southern Peru, namely Cailloma, 

Orcopampa and Arcata. Erickson and Cunningham describe these deposits as adularia-sericite-type, silver­

rich, polymetallic, and base-metal veins. The silver to gold ratio in these deposits is generally more than 300:1 

and production from the three districts has averaged about 500 gft silver. As at Chacala, the mineralization 

occurs in fissure-filling veins along subparallel faults cutting intrusives as well as andesitic flows, breccias, and 

pyroclastics and clastic rock units as well as intrusives. Each of these districts has multiple veins in areas of 

10-15 square km with individual veins generally less than two meters in thickness but up to three kilometres in 

length. Mineralization is reported to occur over a vertical interval of 300-450 metres. The combined historic 

production and reported current reserves of these three Peruvian districts is estimated to range between 8 and 

9 million tonnes, at grades of 400 ppm Ag and 1.3 to 3 ppm Au (Erickson and Cunningham, 1993). The 

authors have been unable to verify the above mentioned information and this information is not necessarily 

indicative of the mineralization on the Chacala property that is the subject of this technical report. 

MINERALIZATION 

Mineralization on the Chacala property is principally structurally controlled and mainly hosted in intrusive rocks 

and less commonly in andesite volcanics and metasediments. The majority of structures in the Chacala area 

trend NW and NE. It is possible that in some locations (e. g. Norteria) mineralization could also form mantos 

and disseminated ore bodies. 

Four distinct mineralized targets have been identified on the Chacala property: Candelaria, San Juan - EI Oro, 

Otatal, and Nortefia 

At the Candelaria mineralization was traced for over 700m and is associated with the presence of quartz­

tourmaline veins locally containing pyrite and copper oxides. Mineralized structures are hosted in a 

granodiorite intrusion that appears to be unmineralized. 

The mineralized target zone is over 15m wide with several sub-parallel veins locally up to 2m wide but the 

majority of the veins are less than 1m wide. The trend of the Candelaria structure measured at the entrance to 



18 

the Candelaria is estimated at 040/82 NE but the authors observed that the dip of the structure could also be 

to the west. 

At the San Juan target mineralization is not well visible and is contained in a manganese (?) rich horizon. 

Mineralization at San Juan appears to be structurally controlled and the structural trend has an attitude of 

325/44NE. At the EI Oro target visible mineralization consists of pyrite and galena hosted in brecciated host 

rock. The main EI Oro structure is very similar to the San Juan structure where mineralization is hosted in a 

black manganese (?) rich horizon with pyrite and galena rich lenses. EI Oro structure appears to trend at 

270/40NE. The combined length of EI Oro and San Juan structures can be presently estimated at 

approximately 300m. 

At the Otatal target quartz rich structure can rich 8m in width and was traced by the authors for approximately 

60m.. Visible mineralization contains locally pyrite and traces of malachite. The structure trends at 014/80E 

and the strength of silicification suggests a much larger, regional extent of the Otatal structural target. 

The Nortefia mineralization is hosted in conglomerate, breccias (?), and metasediments. At the the Nortena 

target two types of mineralization have been identified. The first type represents a structurally controlled 

mineralization also confirmed through several small underground developments (not accessible) located along 

the structurally controlled targets. The second type is a disseminated oxidized sulphide mineralization exposed 

as a gossan in the upper parts of the property. The possible disseminated nature of the Nortefia target could 

cover area over 0.5 by 0.5 km. 

EXPLORATION 

Detector Exploraciones performed the most recent exploration work on the Chacala property during 2009. 

During this time several targets were tested mainly by trenching, mapping, rock sampling, and prospecting to 

determine the validity of historical reports from the various showinqs, Detector Exploraciones crew consisting 

of 2 to 4 geologsts and field assistants identified four distinct exploration targets: Candelaria, San Juan - EI 

Oro, Otatal, and Nortefia, All the above mentioned target areas were mapped and field geological 

observations were compared and merged with available regional geological maps. Geologists identified the 

main showings and took rock chip samples across the structures for analysis. Only the Candelaria structure 

was explored in detail with a total of 270 meters of trench being excavated using a small back hoe. From the 

Candelaria target a total of 63 samples were collected by Detector Exploraciones and sent to ALS-Chemex 

laboratory for analysis (Table 2b). From the EI Oro target 6 rock chip samples, from the San Juan target 2 chip 

and 1 grab samples, from the Otatal target 4 chip samples, and from the Nortefia target 1 chip and 3 grab 

samples were collected by Detector Exploraciones and sent to ALS-Chemex laboratory for analysis (Table 

2a). 



19 

A total of 20 mandays were spent on the trenching program and 138 mandays were spent mapping and 

prospecting. In total, 235 samples were collected from the property by Detector Exploraciones of which 80 

have been assayed. 

Minera Zeppy reports that in addition to $80,000 which was spent acquiring additional claims, some $160,000 

was spent on geological work, with a further $40,000 in expenditures on road maintenance and another 

$20,000 on geological consulting. The partial break down of the geological work conducted by Detector 

Exploraciones since June of 2009 is shown in the following table.

Since 1991 the Chacala property has been explored by various groups including Luismin, Pefioles, Kobex, 

Saddlerock, Hochschild, Kinross, and Minera Mexicana Sombrerete. Only partial reporting of the results from 

previous work have been located to date and this information is summarized in the History section of this 

report. 

Based on Detector Exploraciones work, four distinct exploration targets have been identified: Candelaria, San 

Juan - EI Oro, Otatal, and Nortefia. Rock samples collected by the authors from the identified targets revealed 

the presence of significant silver-gold mineralization. Silver and gold mineralization is commonly associated 

with the presence of strongly anomalous As, Pb, Zn, and Cu (Table 2a, 2b).

Candelaria Target 

The Candelaria vein is over 800m long, has azimuth 040 degrees, and dips approximately 80 degrees to the 

SE. The Candelaria mine covers only 100m of the total strike length of this vein with access on 4 levels 

located approximately 22m below each other to a depth of less than 80m and through a total of approximately 



20 

430m of underground workings. Recent trenching by Detector Exploraciones along 100m of the southwestern 

strike extension of the La Candelaria vein has exposed a target zone consisting of a 15m wide zone with 

several sub-parallel veins locally up to 2m wide. 

The southwestern extension of the Candelaria vein has no known underground development and there are no 

signs of mining activity. 

To confirm geological observations and sampling reported by Detector Exploraciones the authors visited the 

main entrance to the Candelaria mine and trench 1, 2, 3, and 16. Sample intervals and sample numbers 

collected by Detector Exploraciones at Candelaria were well marked in the field with paint and sample 

numbers were visible (Table 2b).

To verify previously reported assay values the authors collected one sample from the entrance of the 

Candelaria mine and one sample from each trench 2,3 and 16 (the most southern exposure of the vein). 

Sample IR001 collected by Detector Exploraciones at the entrance to the Candelaria was re-sampled by the 

authors (sample 84369). On the same wall, there was also another sample number HM50484 visible from 

previous unknown samplers. It is possible that the previous visiting project sampling crew was representing 

Hochschild Mining. The most anomalous assay result obtained by the authors at Candelaria was 1.7m 

grading 1.7 g/t gold and 46 g/t silver. 

The Candelaria structure is hosted in argilically altered and iron-oxidized granodiorite. Silver and gold 

mineralization in La Candelaria is associated with the presence of white quartz and tourmaline with locally 

seen malachite stains. 

Some of the exposed structures in trenches could are up to 2 m in width, but the majority of the veins are less 

than 1m wide. The trend of the Candelaria structure measured at the entrance to the Candelaria mine, in 

trenches and calculated from the mining plans provided to the authors by Detector Exploraciones is estimated 

at 040/82 NE. In one location (trench, sample 84370) the authors observed that the dip of the structure was to

Beyond the presently known trace of the structure, to the SW and NE (past historical mining workings) the 

Candelaria structure disappears; it could be cut off or is covered by overburden and alluvia.

The results from surface samples collected by the authors from Candelaria are presented in Table 3, 

and assay results from surface trench samples collected by Detector Exploraciones are presented in 

Table2b. 

San Juan and EI Oro Targets 

The EI Oro and San Juan targets are located near each other and although at first glance seem to be one 

structure it is more likely that they are two different structures cross cutting at a low angle. The trace of the 

structures was not followed up by the authors and there is no proof that the two mines/structures connect. The 

trend of the San Juan structure is 325/44NE, and the EI Oro structure appears to trend at 270/40NE. The 

combined length of EI Oro and San Juan structures can be presently estimated at approximately 300m. 

The San Juan structure appears to be hosted in a vesicular flow, and there was no visible sulphide 

mineralization observed. The prospective "horizon"/structure is contained in a black (manganese rich?) host 

rock. The San Juan mine was in production until the 1990s (personal communication with the property owner 

Mr. Manuel Beltran Meza) and gold and silver were extracted from 4 mining levels. 

The EI Oro mine is hosted in volcaniclastics and breccias. The main EI Oro structure is similar to the San Juan 

structure, and the authors did not observe any visible sulphides. At the EI Oro, there is the appearance of 

horizontal tension veins sub-parallel to the main EI Oro vein hosted in fragmental rocks and/or breccias. In 

these locations there is the potential for greater mining thicknesses. These lenses and veins have a black 

matrix, are locally iron-oxidized, and contain pyrite, as well as local lenses of galena.

All samples collected by the authors from the San Juan and EI Oro targets returned highly anomalous assay 

results. The results from surface samples collected by the authors are presented in Table 4. The most 

significant sample from San Juan target is 0.8m grading 68.95 glt gold and 140 glt silver, and from the EI Oro 

target 0.8m at 1.33 glt gold, 557 glt silver, 6.8 % zinc, and 11.1% lead (Figure 7b).

Otatal Target 

The Otatal project is located approximately a 2-hour drive from the village of Chacala, and it takes additionally 

at least one hour by foot trail to reach the main Otatal showing. The first hour of the gravel road (from Chalaca 

to Mr. Manuel Beltran Meza's rancho) is quite good, and the second half of the access road to the point where 

the foot trail starts (from the rancho) follows the creek and would be not accessible during rainy seasons. An 

abundance of large boulders in the creek makes this section of the road rugged. This road leads to the paved 

road, but the authors never checked it out. From the road, a narrow foot trail leads to the main Otatal showing. 

The Otatal target forms prominent outcrop consisting of an up to 8m wide siliceous structure exposed in three 

locations. The Otatal structure is hosted in a granodiorite intrusion or on the contact between granodiorite 

intrusion and metasediment and was traced by the authors for approximately 60m. The structure trends at 

014/80E and the strength of silicification suggests a much larger, regional extent of the Otatal structural target. 

One 8m deep shaft (personal communication with the property owner Mr. Manuel Beltran Meza) is the only 

indication of past mining activity. 

The main structure (or the lower part of the structure) is strongly siliceous with minor intervals of clay altered 

intrusive. Siliceous sections contain visible pyrite and locally chalcopyrite, and azurite (samples 84343 and 

84345). The upper part of this structure (or a hanging wall) is strongly silicified and has up to 50% quartz 

stockwork, strong iron-oxidation, disseminated pyrite «5%) and vugginess after leached sulphides (samples 

84342 and 84344). 

The results from surface samples collected by the authors are presented in Table 5. The most anomalous 

assay result obtained through by the authors at Otatal is 0.7m grading 4.26 glt gold, 131 glt silver, and 2.5% 

lead (Figure 7c).

Nortefia Target 

The Nortefia target is reached by a 2 hour drive from Chacala followed by a one hour walk in order to see the 

central-known showing with historical underground development.

Figure 7d. Chacala Project - Nortefia Target 

The Nortefia project is underlined by metasediments mainly represented by fine-grained black siltstone 

interbedded or possibly overlain by a conglomerate. The conglomerate can be divided into two types. One type 

of conglomerate contains white rhyolitic subrounded fragments up to 10cm in diameter and fragments of black 

metasediment within metasedimentary sandy matrix. The second type of conglomerate is lacking rhyolitic 

fragments. The presence of rhyolitic fragments can indicate that this rock unit could be on top of the 

stratigraphical sequence and could represent the first volcanic activity after the clastic sedimentary period. 

Bedding measured in the upper part of the property was 120/848 indicating that at least in some parts of the 

property bedding is almost vertical. In the top part of the visited area, presence of quartzite and breccias with 

quartzite fragments have been identified by the authors. 

Mineralization observed on the Nortefia target appears to be controlled by structures cross cutting 

conglomerates and breccias. It is possible that the mineralized structures cross cut the clastic (or brecciated) 



27
 

host rock and form a disseminated low-grade mineralization or mantos. Lack of underbush and gossans in 

some upper parts of the Norteria target indicates possible presence of disseminated sulphides in rock. This 

observation supports the possible existence of disseminated sulphide mineralization on this target. 

The authors collected four rock samples from this property but the assay results are insignificant with only 

slightly anomalous gold up to 46 ppb and silver up to 5.5 g/t (Table 6). No reports of the historical underground 

workings of the Nortefia area were available to the authors however the existence of these workings suggests 

that sufficient mineralization must have been present to warrant these efforts.

the existence of these workings suggests that sufficient mineralization must have been present to warrant 

these efforts. 

DRILLING 

None of the targets on the Chacala property have been drill tested. 

SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

Detector Exploraciones utilized past historic data to focus their prospecting of the various showings. Samples 

were located using GPS and sample numbers and sample intervals were marked with paint in the field. Most 

of the samples were chip/channel samples collected across the structures. 

The Chacala property covers an area of approximately 10 by 10km area, and only four target areas were 

sampled by Detector Exploraciones. Almost all of the samples collected by Detector Exploraciones and the 

authors were continuous chip samples that intended to test a true width of the target structure. Samples were 

collected with a hammer and a chisel not with a rock saw that would allow collecting a more proper channel 

sample. In the author's opinion collected samples by Detctor Exploraciones and the authors were 

representative of the sampled interval. Indications of samples collected by Detectores Exploraciones were 

often well visible confirming continuity of their chip sampling procedure. 

The Candelaria, Otatal, and San Juan-EI Oro targets are structurally controlled whereas at the Nortefia target 

mineralization is both structurally controlled and possibly of a disseminated nature. Structurally controlled 

targets identified on the Chacala property are relatively narrow, usually <1m in width, and only at the Otatal 

target the structure could reach up to 8m in width. Possible disseminated nature of the Nortefia target that 

could cover area over 0.5 by 0.5 km requires more wide spread sampling possibly on a grid basis. The 



28
 

structurally controlled targets are represented by quartz (Otatal, Norteiia), quartz-tourmaline (Candelaria), fault 

zones (San Juan-EI Oro, Norteiia) hosted in an intrusive or volcaniclastic/breccia type hostrock. The higher 

grade intervals (e.g. EI Oro, Otatal) often contain visible mineralization (galena, pyrite, en-oxides) but the 

intention of the author's sampling was to collect representative samples not high grades. 

The Candelaria structure has received a systematic approach to exploration where trenches were excavated 

across the structure using a small back hoe rented in Tamazula. In most cases the authors observed that 

samples were located where stated however not all samples appear to be true thickness and are not always 

described properly. Samples collected at the Candelaria target covered almost 700m strike length of this 

target with average less than 100m interval between sampled trenches. 

At the Otatal target Detector Exploraciones and the authors sampled two outcrops located approximately 60m 

apart from each other and all samples were collected across the structure. At the San Juan and EI Oro 

targets Detector Exploraciones and the authors collected samples restricted only to the main mineralized 

structures located at the entrance to the underground workings and sampling covered less than 10m ot the 

structural trend. 

At Norteiia samples collected by Detector Exploraciones and the authors were randomly spaces over 

approximately 150 by 150m area. With the potential of disseminated mineralization at this target, future work 

should include a more wide spread sampling. 

The authors observed the personnel and the techniques used at the Chacala project by Detector 

Exploraciones. In general for an early stage exploration project the procedures were adequate to initially test 

the various prospects. Some improvements could be made in supervision and training of the samplers as it 

was observed that although care was taken to representatively sample vein structures often the interstitial host 

rock was not adequately represented. 

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

Samples collected by Detector Exploraciones were all bagged and tagged in the field where collected and then 

stored in a locked house in Chacala prior to shipment to the ALS-Chemex preparation laboratory in 

Guadalajara. There was no on-site sample preparation done. The samples were sent in their original form to 

the laboratory. In the ALS-Chemex preparation laboratory rock samples were dried, crushed and sieved, and 

pulps were shipped to Vancouver. In Canada the samples were analyzed using ME-ICP41 and AA-Au23. 

Initially, samples were not reanalysed for overlimits, but after the authors' suggestion, all samples that assayed 

Au, Ag above the detection limits were re-submitted for additional re-assaying for overlimits. Detector 

Exploraciones did not add internal standards, blanks or duplicates to samples shipped to the ALS-Chemex 

laboratory. 



29 

The ALS-Chemex laboratory is a certified laboratory by Standards Council of Canada Associated Laboratories 

(ALS-Chemex ISO 9001:2000 certification). 

All nineteen samples collected by the authors during the September 11-15, 2009 visit were kept in their 

possession and were personally delivered to the ACME Laboratory located at 852 East Hastings Street in 

Vancouver. There was no on-site sample preparation done. In the ACME Laboratory samples were dried, and 

then each sample was crushed to >70% minus 10 mesh (2mm), a 250 g split was pulverized to 95% passing 

150 mesh. Samples collected by authors were analyzed using 36 element ICP-MS (Group 1DX2 method). 

Sample splits of 0.5 g were leached in hot (95 degrees) Aqua Regia. A larger split of 15 g was separated for 

gold analysis. Samples that contained assay values above the detection limits for specific elements were 

reanalysed for that element. 

The authors did not apply internal QAlQC programs for samples shipped to the ACME Laboratory. The 

authors only reviewed the assay results of the duplicate, standard and blank samples provided by the ACME 

laboratory, and the authors were satisfied with the results. The authors were also reasonably satisfied with the 

assay results obtained from the sample intervals re-sampled by the authors which were initially sampled by 

Detector Exploraciones (see Data Verification). 

The ACME Laboratory is a certified laboratory by Standards Council of Canada Associated Laboratories (150­

9001-2008 certification) and WHO cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice). 

For the future work on the Chacala property it is recommended that Parlane would include gold/silver 

standards for insertion amongst the samples submitted to the lab. In addition blank samples should be 

submitted to check the lab for sample preparation contamination. 

DATA VERIFICATION 

The sample location data was obtained using handheld GPS by Detector Exploraciones SA de C.V and was 

verified in the field by the authors. In some cases greater detail is needed to identify individual samples within 

small areas. The authors collected 4 samples to check the accuracy of the Detector work at the Candelaria 

trenches, the results of which are tabulated below. 

The results show that both arsenic and gold values are somewhat erratic. This could be explained by either 

gold nugget effect or irregular mineralization in the veins as well as slightly different sampling methods but in 

any case the check sampling has indicated anomalous to economic results in all areas of interest.

ADJACENT PROPERTIES
 

The most significant is the El Cobre/EI Porvenir mines located in the surrounded block of claims not included
 

in the Zeppy group. According to an anonymous published government project proposal the El Cobre/EI
 

Porvenir prospect has similar grade to the San Juan vein. There are other showings in the area are EI Cobre
 

Viejo, Santa Rita, Agua Zarca, La Divisa, La Toronja, La Cabrer'ia, La Reyna and EI Mantito.
 

The Nuestra Senora deposit near the town of Cosala is rouqhly 60 km south of the project and Scorpio Mining
 

Corp. is advancing the mine to production. The Nuestra Senora deposit is a silver, zinc, lead, and copper
 

carbonate replacement style mineralization.
 

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING
 

The has been no reports of mineral processing presented to the authors and there is no milling equipment
 

present on the property however there is evidence of crude grinding and gravity concentration techniques
 

used in the streams.
 

MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES
 

There are no compliant resource estimates for any of the Chacala showings.
 

OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION
 

The authors are not aware of any other data relevant to this report.
 

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
 

The Chacala property is large in area with numerous historic showings. The isolated location appears to have
 

resulted in little systematic exploration having been done on it however, since 1991 the Chacala property has
 

been visited by numerous groups including Luismin, Perioles, Kobex, Saddlerock, Hochschild, Kinross, Minera
 

Mexicana Sombrerete and most recently Detector Exploraciones. The authors have obtained anomalous to
 

economic sample results from all of the known showings all of which warrant some follow up exploration.
 



31 

Trenching of the Candelaria vein has resulted in delineation of mostly narrow quartz-tourmaline veins along a 

700 meter strike length. Although Detector Exploraciones has reported two narrow samples with over 12 and 

8 grams per tonne gold, and 43 and 520 grams per tonne silver from 0.3 and 0.1 meter veins, the best result 

that the authors received was 1.6 glt Au and 46 glt Ag over 1.7 meters. Resampling done by the authors of 

the same sample interval at the entrance to the Candelaria mine return significant difference in gold content 

9.65 glt (sample collected by Detector Exploraciones) versus 1.61 glt (sample collected by the authors). The 

author's sample was collected over the same sample width as the Detector Exploraciones sample and the 

difference in gold content can be attributed to the gold nugget effect or irregular mineralization in the veins. 

Further sampling is warranted to determine the continuity of the grade in these locations. 

The San Juan and EI Oro structures lie in close proximity to one another and both structures have returned 

economic gold and silver values. The best results obtained by the authors form San Juan were 68.95 glt Au, 

140 glt Ag and 13.9 glt Au, 59 glt Ag, both samples were collected across 0.8 meter wide structure. These 

assay results are very much similar to the assay results obtained by Detector Exploraciones of 33.9 glt Au and 

113 glt Ag over the same sample width. Also, the assay results obtained from samples collected from the EI 

Oro structure by the authors and Detector Exploraciones are similar. The best results obtained by the authors 

are 1.33 glt Au, 557 glt Ag over 0.8 sample width and by Detector Exploraciones are 4.64 glt Au, 278 glt Ag. 

The authors did not have sufficient time on the property to discern if these two occurrences possibly connect. 

In either event mineralogically these structures seem related but the trace of the veins was not followed up by 

the authors. The EI Oro - San Juan vein trace is covered by thin overburden and additional trenching is 

warranted to follow it up, this target like Candelaria has good access. 

The Otatal structure can be easily seen on surface for approximately 60m, but the width and strength of this 

silicious structure lead the authors to postulate that the structure continues much further and possibly has a 

regional extent. The structure is strongly siliceous and contains visible pyrite and copper mineralization. The 

Otatal showlnq is located near the top of a steep mountain side, the extensions of this structure should be 

located down the hill closer to the road access. Rock chip sample assay results obtained by the authors and 

Detector Exploraciones are reasonably similar and indicate presence of gold ranging between between 0.23 to 

4.26 glt and silver raging between 29.2 to 131 glt over sample widths 0.7 to 5.0m. Presently sampled 

structural interval only evaluated a small portion of a probably much longer structural trend. Also, a strongly 

siliceous nature of the vein could require a use of the rock saw to properly collect samples. 

At the Norteiia target the most interesting result come from the composite grab sample collected over 50m by 

the authors. Sample assayed 5.5g/t Ag and 4ppb Au indicating possibility of existence of the disseminated 

mineralization. The Norteiia target has not been adequately tested or understood by the authors or Detector 

Exploraciones to form any conclusions, so further prospecting should be done to better define this area. 



32
 

Quality assurance and control of sampling procedures, data management and sample analysis were all 

somewhat deficient in the work on the property conducted by Detector Exploraciones. 

In summary, based on the following criteria, the known mineralization on the Chacala property may be the 

expression of several hydrothermal systems (pulses) producing a series of closely-spaced, sub-parallel 

mineralized structures related to a regional northwest trending fault zone as well as northeastern cross cutting 

structural zones. 

Important geological aspects include: 

•	 the existing silver-gold (copper-Iead-zinc-arsenic) mineralization identified and sampled by Detector 

Exploraciones and the authors; 

•	 the length of the vein systems and the existence of several NE and NW trending vein systems 

(Candelaria, EI Oro, San Juan, Otatal, Norteiia), breccia system (EI Oro, Norteiia), and possibly 

disseminated mineralization (Norteiia); 

•	 the presence of northeast striking mineralized faults crossing the main northwestern regional trend 

(e.g. Candelaria) 

Further work is recommended. 



33 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

A two phase program is recommended to quickly evaluate the potential of the Chacala property. 

A Phase I exploration program is recommended to explore all targets on the Chacala property, specifically the 

Candelaria, San Jose - EI Oro, and Otatal vein systems. This program will include compilation of previous 

exploration data and the preparation of orthophoto and digital topographic maps, geological mapping, 

geochemical and rock sampling, trenching, road repairs and geophysical surveys with an estimated budget of 

$US of 260,000. Phase 1 work at the Candelaria vein system should focus on the better grade samples and 

increase the trench density in the best areas to determine if ore shoots may be present. The San Jose and EI 

Oro structural trend warrants more detailed chip sampling at systematic spacing within the workings and also 

between workings along strike, brushing out the San Juan road may provide drill access for parts of this 

target. Geochemistry will help follow the Otatal vein as well as the others but systematic sampling along the 

vein where it is known will determine the worth of this showing. The Phase I exploration program should 

assess the mineral potential of the Norteria target while locating drill targets for Phase 2. 

Most of the mineralized structures on the Chacala property are underexplored. In valley bottoms they are 

covered by overburden or alluvia, and in areas elevated they were never properly explored through trenching 

or modern geochemical and geophysical exploration techniques. 

The recommended geophysical program is a combined magnetic, IP and resistivity surveys (possibly NSAMT 

survey) that should cover all target areas. The geophysical lines should be run at a normal angle to the trace 

of the structural targets, and the depth penetration should be approximately 300m in order to obtain data from 

the surface weathering and oxidation zones to fresh unweathered rock. The line separations, station 

spacings, dipole separation, and type of array should be determined in consultation with a licensed 

geophysicist. 

Diamond drill targets should include the strike, dip, and depth extensions of the exposed veins or structural 

trends. Care should be taken to try to understand potential ore shoots within the vein structures prior to drilling. 

Chargeability anomalies associated with known veins, structural or disseminated targets or their inferred 

extensions should be considered high priority drill targets. Tabular or linear zones of chargeability with NE or 

NW strikes in covered areas should also be considered for drill testing. 

All subsequent programs conducted on the Chacala property need QAlQC procedures in place which will 

include the insertion of standards and blanks into the sample stream in addition to 3rd party duplicates. 

Costs for Phase I of exploration are estimated at US$260,000. 



34
 

Contingent on the successful completion of Phase I, a Phase II exploration program consisting primarily of 

2,000 meter of diamond drilling target areas defined in Phase I. The Phase II program as proposed will include 

follow up geology, geochemistry and sampling in addition to the drilling and is estimated to cost US$820,000.
