Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

1.0 SUMMARY 
 
1.1 Introduction and Summary of Recent Work 
 
Chlumsky, Armbrust & Meyer LLC (herein "CAM") was retained by Strathmore Minerals Corp. (herein 
"Strathmore") to prepare an independent Technical Report Update on their Gas Hills uranium project in 
Wyoming, USA.  This report conforms to Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure 
for Mineral Projects, as required by the Canadian Securities Administration for publicly traded 
companies.  Qualified Persons from CAM visited the Strathmore office and facilities in Riverton, 
Wyoming and the project in the Field on January 24-26, 2012, August 7-8, 2012, and November 7-9, 
2012. 
 
The last date for drilling/sampling/logging data used in preparation of this report was November 19, 2012, 
which is regarded as the effective date of this report.  Results were received by CAM over a three-month 
period starting in August 2011. 
 
This Technical Report summarizes the pre-1990 historical exploration and production on Strathmore's 
Gas Hills property, and Strathmore's drilling from 2007 to November 2012.  It replaces a Technical 
Report prepared by CAM and filed on SEDAR in August 2012.  The present report mainly focuses on 
five project areas that had previous production and are believed to contain potentially economic uranium 
mineralization.  These are the Bullrush, Day Loma, George-Ver, Loco-Lee, and Rock Hill properties.  
Despite the significant historical drilling, including thousands of drill holes and numerous historical 
estimates by previous operators for these five properties, and Strathmore's possession of two data 
libraries, these data have not been verified in sufficient detail to provide comprehensive NI 43-101 
compliant statements of mineral resources.  Strathmore has initiated and nearly completed an $8 million 
confirmation and exploration drilling program as part of its efforts to provide sufficient verifiable data 
and information to support the preparation of current resource estimates for those areas cited by this 
report. 
 
Historical uranium production in the Gas Hills was about 100 million pounds, mainly from open-pit 
mining.  Uranium mineralization is contained in roll-front deposits hosted by arkosic sandstone beds of 
the Wind River formation of early Tertiary age.  The deposits are distinctly stratabound, and occur from 
the surface to depths of 1,200 feet. 
 
1.2 Property Description and Location, History of Exploration and Development 
 
The Gas Hills Uranium Project, located in Fremont and Natrona Counties, Wyoming, totals about 36,000 
acres and consists of 1,711 unpatented lode mining claims, one State of Wyoming mineral lease, and one 
private mineral lease.  The properties are in central Wyoming within Townships 31-33 North, Ranges 89-

91 West, 6th Principal Meridian.  CAM has reviewed legal agreements and documents filed with federal 
and state government agencies as required by law.  CAM has confirmed that Strathmore has fulfilled all 
legal requirements and holds the lands current to August 31, 2013. 
 
Between 1953 and 1988 many companies explored, developed, and produced uranium, in the Gas Hills 
Uranium District, on lands in the Main Gas Hills area, now controlled by Strathmore.  Three uranium 
mills operated in the district.  Cumulative production totaled about 100 million pounds of uranium, 
mainly from open-pit mining, but also from underground and "in-situ" recovery.  The main period of 
production was in the 1960's and 1970's, gradually halting in the 1980's in the wake of the Three Mile 
Island nuclear plant accident in 1979.  Currently, Cameco Corporation is pursuing permitting for an in-
situ recovery operation on lands adjacent to Strathmore's Gas Hills Project, with production planned to 
begin in 2014. 
 
1.3 Geology and Uranium Mineralization 
 
The host for uranium mineralization in the Gas Hills District is the Eocene Wind River Formation, a 
continental fluvial sedimentary sequence consisting of arkosic sandstones with lesser amounts of 
siltstone, carbonaceous mudstone, and tuffaceous sandstone. 
 
The uranium deposits are roll-front type, crescent-shaped in vertical cross section, and with a linear 
sinuous pattern in plan view.  Reduced uranium minerals, uraninite and a little coffinite are concentrated 
in the sandstone matrix in the crescent roll.  A concave contact separates the roll from adjacent bleached 
and oxidized host rock barren of uranium.  This contact is the "roll-front".  Upper and lower boundaries 
of mineralization generally are beds of impermeable mudstone.  Individual rolls can be a few feet to tens 
of feet thick.  In plan, rolls can be traced for several thousand feet. 
 
Roll-type uranium deposits are formed where oxidized and soluble uranium is carried down a permeable 
sandstone bed to a point where it meets reducing conditions.  Uranium is reduced and deposited as 
uraninite and coffinite along the roll-front. 
 
Strathmore's Gas Hills property is considered by CAM to have a very good exploration potential, above 
and beyond the NI 43-101 compliant resources discussed below.  Application of current and historical 
exploration information, and known geological controls on mineralization, suggest that additional U3O8 
could be present in already-identified trends, in addition to areas where sparse drill information is 
available, such as the exploration area south of Beaver Rim, where geological conditions are highly 
encouraging.  The potential quantity and grade in these targets is conceptual in nature; exploration 
activity has not been sufficient to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration 
will result in the targets being delineated as a mineral resource under NI 43-101.  The exploration 



 

 

CAM 127117 3 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

targets stated in the Report are not being reported as part of any Mineral Resource or Mineral 
Reserve.  The targets either contain known mineralization as determined by historical exploration 
activities or lie adjacent to known uranium mineralization.  Characteristics of each target such as grade, 
length of mineralized trend, width or thickness can only be projected from nearby areas containing well 
defined mineralized bodies.  These are exploration targets and merit further drilling. 
 
1.4 Exploration and Drilling by Strathmore 
 
Strathmore's drilling activities have focused primarily on the Bullrush, Day Loma, George-Ver, Loco-
Lee, Tablestakes, and Rock Hill Project Areas within the Main Gas Hills, and to lesser extent on 
exploration targets south of Beaver Rim above the Main Gas Hills area.  All of the main Gas Hills 
properties have a significant historical resource and at least several hundred historical holes in each 
property.  Beginning in 2007 and continuing to the present, Strathmore's exploration for uranium in the 
Gas Hills has involved confirmation drilling of previously-explored areas, along with some step-out 
drilling in other areas.  Additional drilling to assist with definition of the water table, preliminary 
metallurgical tests, and design of a heap-leach pad and recovery plant, has also been initiated.  
Exploration and confirmation drilling, permitting activities, engineering, and metallurgical work are 
ongoing as part of a US $8 million program formally announced on June 26, 2012.  This program is 
nearly complete as of the November 19, 2012 cut-off date for review and analysis of data contained in 
this report.  New data obtained from the final stage of the program will be incorporated in future updated 
reports. 
 
Strathmore has been using a Prompt-Fission-Neutron logging tool, gamma-ray probing tools, and select 
chemical assays from core drilling, for the measurement of uranium in the Gas Hills.  Equivalent uranium 
values, expressed as eU3O8 are obtained from down-hole gamma-ray probes, assuming that uranium and 
its daughter products are in radiogenic equilibrium.  The probes are standardized and calibrated using test 
pits operated by U.S. Department of Energy, located in Casper, Wyoming and Grand Junction, Colorado.  
Many drill holes completed prior to November 19 2012 have been logged using a Prompt-Fission-
Neutron (PFN) logging tool which gives a direct measurement of uranium content.  Prompt Fission 
Neutron analysis assesses the quantity of uranium present surrounding a drill hole directly, by measuring 
those neutrons resulting from fission of the 235U isotope.  This eliminates the uncertainties due to 
measuring the gamma radiation resulting from decay of uranium daughter products, which may be 
subjected to selective remobilization due to the varying chemical properties of each daughter element.  
PFN also samples a larger sample than the typical 3" diameter core that is obtained for chemical analysis. 
 
It is anticipated that, through regular ongoing use of PFN with its associated calibration checks and 
continuing checks against existing or historical core holes, a background of validity can be achieved 
which will reduce the number and frequency of future chemical-assay checks although chemical assay

checks should continue as recommended by the Canadian Institute of Mining ("CIM") Estimation of 
Minerals Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines. 
 
The majority of the additional drill holes completed subsequent to the data cutoff date of November 19, 
2012 for the previous report were rotary-drilled, with some reverse-circulation holes and cored sections.  
Detailed results of Strathmore's drilling are presented in Section 10 of this report.  A brief summary of 
Strathmore drilling for each of the five Project Areas located in the Main Gas Hills, and the Beaver Rim 
Exploration Area drilling, is presented below.  All drilling conducted subsequent to the previous report 
was completed in 2012.  Conformation and exploration drilling continues as of the date of this report.

Strathmore completed 60 rotary and 3 core drill holes during 2012 in the Bullrush Project Area for total 
combined footage of 17,420 feet. 
 
Day Loma 
Strathmore completed 25 rotary drill holes and 2 core holes during 2012 in the Day Loma Project Area 
for a total footage of 11,750 feet. 
 
George-Ver

1.5 Sample Preparation, Analyses, Security, and Protocols 
 
1.5.1 Historical Analyses 
 
The bulk of the drilling on the property was undertaken prior to 1980, and is considered "historical" under 
NI 43-101.  Sedimentary roll uranium deposits were historically sampled by measuring the quantity of 
radiation emitted along the length of a drill hole, and converting these measurements into equivalent 
grade and thickness of uranium mineralization.  Standard logs consist of recordings of gamma, self-
potential, and resistivity.  Equivalent U3O8 content was calculated from gamma logs using industry-
standard methods developed by the Atomic Energy Commission, now the U.S. Department of Energy 
(DOE.) Some check analyses were done by fluorimetric chemical analyses and closed-can radiometric 
analyses.  Any differences between the two analyses would indicate a radiogenic disequilibrium situation 
where gamma logs did not provide an accurate analysis of the quantity of uranium present.  Chemical 
analyses for uranium were historically done at ISO-certified laboratories. 
 
1.5.2 Strathmore Data 
 
Between 2007 and November 11 2011, Strathmore, logged all its holes with gamma-ray probes.  A few 
core holes were drilled to supplement the gamma data, and to provide material for metallurgical testing.  
Recently, Strathmore has implemented PFN logging, and select core assaying, in addition to gamma 
logging.  PFN analysis assesses the quantity of uranium present surrounding a drill hole directly by 
measuring neutrons fissioned from the 235U isotope, thus aiding in determining any disequilibrium which 
may be present. 
 
1.6 Data Verification 
 
Validation of the drill hole database is a key element in preparation of this NI 43-101 report.  The drill 
hole database for the Strathmore's Gas Hills project consists of thousands of historical drill holes with 
gamma logs, mostly from the 1970s, but also with some from as early as the 1950s.  It is recognized that 
gamma logs are indirect measurements of the amount of uranium present and must be validated.  
Typically, this process consists of comparing equivalent uranium determined from gamma log 
interpretations with chemical analyses of rock core recovered from core holes.  This process is subject to 
some degree of uncertainty because the gamma logs and the chemical assays are obtained from different 
samples: core from the drill hole itself and gamma readings from the material surrounding the hole. 
 
CAM found the historical data to be consistent with the methods used by mining companies in the 1960s-
1980s.  Not all drill logs are present, sometimes just the results posted on maps.  While Strathmore was 
successful in acquiring two data libraries in 2010, it is believed that additional historical data exists, 
which would be useful for Strathmore to pursue and acquire. 



 

 

CAM 127117 6 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

CAM undertook a rigorous statistical comparison of Strathmore's drilling results with those of historical 
operators, as shown in Section 12 of this report.  The comparison also included comparison of historical 
chemical assays of historical drill core with gamma logs of the cored intervals, and comparison of 
Strathmore's gamma and PFN logging of the dual-probed intervals.  As a result of these studies, CAM 
concluded that the historical drilling at Bullrush, Day Loma, George-Ver, Loco-Lee, and Rock Hill, 
augmented by recent Strathmore drilling, are suitable for use in mineral resource estimation.  There was 
not sufficient comparative data from Tablestakes, Jeep, or the Beaver Rim Exploration Area to allow 
estimation of compliant resources in these three areas. 
 
1.7 Metallurgical Studies 
 
Strathmore's concept is to mine uranium-bearing material by open-pit methods, heap-leach the mined 
material, and recover uranium by ion exchange.  Strathmore contracted Lyntek Inc. of Denver, Colorado, 
to conduct preliminary metallurgical tests by bottle-roll and column-leach which have been carried out to 
assess uranium recoveries.  Eight composite samples were prepared from RC drill cuttings obtained from 
drilling at Bullrush-Tablestakes, Day Loma, George-Ver, Loco-Lee and Rock Hill properties.  These were 
submitted to InterMountain Labs in Sheridan, Wyoming and to Lyntek for metallurgical test work. 
 
Results of preliminary bottle-roll tests indicate average recoveries of 89.2% and low overall reagent 
consumption.  However, it should be noted that the analytical methods for determining the uranium in the 
leach residue were determined to be inadequate due to improper digestion techniques, such that the actual 
uranium content in the head samples could have been reported as lower than actual values, which would 
have artificially increased the uranium recovery estimates.  Unfortunately, the residues were no longer 
available for additional sample analysis.  Therefore, the recovery calculations are suspect and can only be 
considered as indicative.  Later bottle-roll analysis, performed by Litz and Associates, of Golden 
Colorado, reported recoveries of 82%-94%.  Initial data from Strathmore's in-house Summer 2012 
Column-Leach Test report an overall recovery of 91%. 
 
1.8 Mineral Resource Estimation 
 
The six project areas reviewed by CAM for the estimation of resources were Bullrush, Day Loma, Loco-
Lee, George-Ver, Rock Hill, and Tablestakes. All of these properties have a significant historical resource 
and at least several hundred historical holes in each property.  All six areas have additional Strathmore 
analyses by PFN, which provides a direct measure of uranium, as opposed to gamma logs which are an 
indirect measure of uranium through radiation from uranium daughter products. 
 



 

 

CAM 127117 7 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

Five of the six areas from above, Bullrush, Day Loma, George-Ver, Loco-Lee, and Rock Hill, have 
sufficient consistent PFN and gamma log data adequately distributed over the property to allow 
estimation of an inferred or indicated resource.  Key assumptions in the resource estimate are as follows: 
 

1. CAM reviewed gamma ray, PFN, closed can and chemical assay data for all five properties.  
For Day Loma and George-Ver CAM found that PFN, closed can and chemical assay data 
supported the assumption that the gamma ray eU3O8 could be used for calculation of indicated 
and inferred resources.  For Bullrush, Rock Hill, and Loco-Lee the data are suitable for 
estimation of an inferred resource but believes that additional chemical, closed can and 
associated PFN and gamma ray data are required for the estimation of indicated and measured 
resources. 

2. CAM reviewed the geometry in three dimensions of mineral intercepts above the grade of 0.035 
and a minimum thickness of 1 foot.  A content of 0.035% eU3O8 corresponds to a contained 
uranium value of $35 per ton at a $50 uranium price.  A foot is about the minimum thickness 
that can be selectively mined by open pit methods.  This review indicated that likely open pit 
minable mineralization is confined by elevations or depths. These elevations or depths were 
used to define limits for a potentially open pit minable resource. 

3. Day Loma and George-Ver were historically mined by open pits and by underground workings.  
The areas of historic mining were excluded from resource tabulation based on the plan footprint 
of historic mining.  Depending on backslope and vertical extent of underground workings, this 
may be conservative. 

4. Grade thickness and thickness contour maps were constructed using all the data and a zero 
nugget linear variogram.  This gives a smooth contour map which honors the data.  The contour 
maps were consistent with usual roll front deposit geometry but all contour maps showed the 
connectivity associated with potentially minable mineral deposits. 

5. Limits of mineralization in plan for each of the five areas were provided by Strathmore. CAM 
reviewed these and found them to be reasonable so resource reporting was additionally 
constrained to within these areas. 

6. Based on the variogram ranges of a minimum about 200 feet and review of grade thickness 
contour maps CAM classified resources as inferred if values were interpolated up to 400 ft and 
extrapolated to 200 feet and were not indicated. Resources were classified as indicated if values 
were interpolated up to 282 ft and extrapolated to 141 ft.  Note that indicated must also have an 
acceptable equilibrium factor. 

7. A specific volume of 16.9 cubic feet per ton is suitable for the estimation of tonnage and 
contained pounds.  This is based on current measurements. Although additional specific volume 
information should be obtained, CAM believes this value is suitable for estimation of an 
inferred and indicated resource.

CAM 127117 9

22 March 2013 

Resources are reported at cutoffs of 1 foot of 0.035 %eU3O8.  This cutoff is reasonable and will be 
revised as actual economics become available. 
 
CAM believes that additional successful confirmation drilling, probing and sampling with direct measure 
of uranium will allow these inferred and indicated resources to be upgraded to a measured and indicated 
resource estimate. 
 
The Tablestakes and Jeep project areas and Beaver Rim exploration area do not have sufficient data to 
allow measured, indicated and inferred resources to be calculated at this time.  CAM believes that 
additional drilling, probing, and sampling, with direct measure of uranium, will allow estimation of 
potential resources in these areas.  For the areas covered by historical data, CAM does not expect 
significant changes from the historical resource numbers, but this expectation must be confirmed by 
additional data. 
 
1.9 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
CAM recommends the following actions, as detailed in Section 26. 

1. Resample historical holes, or drill twin holes, to obtain additional data.  Continue to try to 
obtain additional historical data and validate all historic data.  Attempt to define the surface 
representing the lowest open pit mining and the elevation of underground mining operations.  
CAM excluded from resources all the area within the plan footprint of historic mining which 
may be conservative. 

2. Review existing PFN data to develop standard procedures for comparing PFN readings with 
other methods. 

3. Strathmore should continue a program whereby a certain proportion of holes (initially 10%) are 
logged by certified independent parties, with duplicate logging (independent + Strathmore) of 
some holes, say 5%, in areas expected to be advanced beyond the inferred resource category. 

4. A program of determining tonnage factors should be undertaken, by systematic measurements 
of about 100 core or fresh highwall samples.  This program should be supervised and carried 
out by Strathmore personnel, to avoid the problems which normally arise when such work is 
farmed out to an outside commercial laboratory. 

5. Review the potential for modeling individual roll fronts as separate units, even though this is 
contrary to historic practice in the Gas Hills because of the complexity and imbrication of the 
mineral stringers. 

6. Completions of the previously recommended Work Program, costing about $US 7.7 million, is 
recommended for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013.  The major remaining components of 
the Work Program are continuing exploration and confirmation drilling ($2.3 million) and 



 

 

CAM 127117 10 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

metallurgical tests ($0.171 million) involving over 162,000 feet of drilling and gamma and PFN 
logging.  The Work Program drilling is for several purposes: 

a. to elevate the resource status from inferred to indicated and measured and increase 
indicated as warranted; 

b. to explore the trends and potential mineral targets discussed in Section 9 of this report, 
which may contain extensions of recognized mineralization; and 

c. to obtaining geologic information and indications of mineralization that will justify 
follow-up close-spaced exploration drilling through reconnaissance exploration drilling 
south of Beaver Rim divide. 

7. The other portions of the Work Program are intended to advance the design and permitting of 
the process facilities for eventual production and will likely extend thru 2013.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
2.1 Purpose of Report and Terms of Reference 
 
Strathmore Resources (US) Ltd., a Nevada Corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Strathmore 
Minerals Corp. TSX: STM engaged Chlumsky, Armbrust & Meyer LLC to prepare a technical report 
update for the Gas Hills Uranium Project, Fremont and Natrona Counties Wyoming, in compliance with 
the requirements of the Canadian National Instrument 43-101. Strathmore has a corporate address at 950-
1130 West Pender Street, Vancouver B.C. Canada V6E 4A4, and a Wyoming field office at 2420 Watt 
Court, Riverton, WY, 82501 USA, telephone 1-800-647-3303. 
 
This present report is considered an update and revision of a previous NI43-101 Technical Report, Gas 
Hills Uranium Project, Fremont and Natrona Counties, Wyoming, USA prepared for Strathmore by 
Chlumsky, Armbrust and Meyer, July 31, 2012 (Nielsen, Pool & Sandefur, 2012.)  The effective date of 
the report is November 19, 2012 and corresponds to the cut off date for accepting 
drilling/sampling/logging data used in preparation of this report.  Data was received by CAM over a 
three-month period starting in August 2012, and ending on November 19, 2012. 
 
The Gas Hills project is an exploration project which has advanced to the establishment of NI 43-101-
compliant uranium resources as defined in this report.  Strathmore controls about 36,000 acres of 
unpatented mining claims, a Wyoming State mineral lease, and fee land that covers the project area of 
uranium mineralization. 
 
The purpose of this report is to disclose a CAM-generated resource estimate in conformance with NI 43-
101.  Uranium resource estimation and report authorship was undertaken by the following CAM 
Qualified Persons: Richard Nielsen, Ph.D. (geologist); Thomas Pool, P.E. (mining engineer); Robert 
Sandefur, P.E. (geostatistician); and Matthew Reilly, P.E. (mining engineer).  Sections 2 through 10, 13, 
and 20 were authored by Dr. Nielsen.  Sections 11 and 12 were authored by Mr. Pool.  Section 14 was 
prepared by Mr. Sandefur.  Mr. Reilly provided engineering review and final editing of the overall report. 
 
2.2 Sources of Information 
 
Portions of the Strathmore property have been explored and mined by numerous operators since the early 
1950's, and a large historical database exists, in addition to data generated by Strathmore since 2007.  
 
CAM reviewed project data provided by Strathmore, conducted site visits to confirm the data and 
mineralization, and reviewed the project site access and layout.  Other information for various key 
technical aspects of this report were obtained from a report by Snow (2011, see Section 27, References).  
CAM also examined the available geologic and mining reports, and company files and records of

Adobe/Vipont, American Nuclear Corp, Federal-American Partners, Energy Fuels, Utah 
Intl/Pathfinder/AREVA, Union Carbide, Western Nuclear, Cameco, and Strathmore, pertaining to the Gas 
Hills Project that are in the possession of Strathmore. 
 
Messrs. Sandefur, Pool and Nielsen conducted a field visit to the Gas Hills property on January 25, 2012, 
and visited with Strathmore's geological and engineering team in their Riverton office from January 24 
and January 26, 2012.  In addition, Dr. Nielsen spent April 24-25, 2012, in the Riverton office and in the 
field.  During this field visit Dr. Nielsen observed and reviewed exploration drilling procedures at the 
Loco-Lee project area.  He observed two operating rotary drill rigs and bore holes being logged for 
uranium using two logging trucks; one with a gamma ray probe and the other using a PFN probe.  He also 
visited other exploration target areas (Jeep, Day Loma, Bullrush, George-Ver and Rock Hill.)  Dr. Nielsen 
also visited the property on August 7 and 8 2012 and visited site of drilling activities at the Beaver Rim 
target area, reviewed drilling and observed logging and sampling of diamond drill core recently obtained 
from various locations on the property.  Using a GPS receiver, Dr. Nielsen verified locations of several 
claim corners, and historical drill hole collars. 
 
Mr. Reilly conducted a field visit to the Gas Hills property on November 7, 2012 and met with 
Strathmore's geologist and engineering team at their Riverton office on November 8 and 9, 2012.  During 
the field visit Mr. Reilly observed on-going exploration drilling activity in the Rock Hill and Day Loma 
areas, gamma and PFN logging activity, drill site reclamation activity, and exploration drilling activity by 
Cameco on Beaver Rim adjacent to Strathmore exploration targets on Beaver Rim.  Mr. Reilly visited all 
of the site locations that are currently being evaluated for resource evaluation as described in this report, 
the proposed exploration target areas on Beaver Rim, several of the abandoned historical open pits and 
abandoned mobile equipment maintenance facilities, and the reclaimed mill sites and facilities near Rock 
Hill and Tablestakes.  Using a GPS receiver collar coordinates of several recent drill holes were 
confirmed. 
 
In addition to the field visit, Mr. Reilly also reviewed Strathmore's Wyoming DEQ Mine Permit 
Application and discussed various aspects of surface and mineral ownership, mine plans, and 
infrastructure development, contained in the permit application.  Recent metallurgical reports and density 
testing procedures and results were also reviewed and discussed. 
 
The authors have reviewed the historical and recent drilling records, gamma log and grade percent 
interpretations, map postings, and the historical tonnage estimates used to generate the mineral resource 
estimates presented in Section 14 (Mineral Resource Estimates) of this Technical Report.  In CAM's 
opinion, the project data is present in sufficient detail, is credible and verifiable, and is an accurate 
representation of the uranium deposits that comprise the Gas Hills project.

Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
4.1 Location 
 
The Gas Hills is located in central Wyoming (Figure 4-1), lying along the southern edge of the Wind 
River basin and near the northern edge of the Granite Mountains.  Strathmore's Gas Hills Uranium 
Project consists of 1,711 unpatented lode mining claims (35,350 acres), one State of Wyoming mineral 
lease (320 acres), and one private mineral lease (80 acres), totaling approximately 35,800 acres, located in 
Townships 31-33 North and Ranges 89-91 West, Wyoming 6th Principal Meridian. 
 
4.2 Mining Claims 
 
The 1,711 unpatented lode mining claims (Table 4-1, Figures 4-2, 4-3) are located predominantly on 
public lands administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM); 94 of the claims were located 
on split-estate lands wherein the surface is privately owned but the federal government retained the 
mineral rights.  28 new unpatented lode mining claims were staked by Strathmore since the previous NI 
43-101 report and were added to Table 4-1 below.  A copy of the receipts for recordation of the claims 
from the Fremont and Natrona County Clerks offices and the BLM were examined.  
 
A copy of a receipt from the BLM, stamped #2712559 and dated August 16, 2012 for the payment of the 
Annual Mining Claim Maintenance Fee, together with a list of the applicable 1,683 claims, is in 
possession of CAM.  CAM possesses copies of notarized and recorded Affidavit of Annual Mining Claim 
Maintenance Fee Payment for Natrona and Fremont Counties for the assessment year beginning 
September 1, 2012, dated October 16, 2012 on behalf of Strathmore Resources (US) Ltd. for the Gas Hills 
claims.  These affidavits were recorded in the official records of Natrona and Fremont Counties, 
Wyoming as required by law.  Strathmore has paid all required fees and filings that will hold the claims to 
August 31, 2013.

Strathmore entered into an agreement with Elmhurst Financial Group Inc., October 31, 2007, to purchase 
155 unpatented lode mining claims located in the Rock Hill part of the Gas Hills project.  CAM has a 
copy of the Quit Claim Deed transferring ownership to Strathmore that was recorded with the Fremont 
and Natrona County recorders.  A net production royalty of 5% was assigned to Elmhurst on 155 claims.  
Eight claims were staked at Rock Hill and one claim at South Black Mountain by Strathmore on behalf of 
Elmhurst; Elmhurst was assigned the 5% royalty on these newly staked claims.  Another nine claims were 
also staked at the Rock Hill property; Elmhurst was assigned a 5% royalty on only the southern 720 feet 
of the claims.  On all the other claims in the Gas Hills Uranium Project, there are no royalties or other

hindrances; Strathmore owns a 100% interest in 1,538 lode mining claims.  The claims with an attached 
5% royalty are depicted as yellow on Figure 4-3 below. 
 

 
Figure 4-1 

State of Wyoming:  Gas Hills Uranium Project Location Map 
 
 
4.3 State of Wyoming Mineral Lease 
 
Strathmore acquired the State of Wyoming Mineral Lease (#0-42121) on April 2 2007; the lease covers 
320 acres of the NEÂ¼, NÂ½NWÂ¼, and EÂ½SEÂ¼, Sec. 36, T33N, R90W.  The terms of the lease are in effect 
for a period of 10 years, expiring April 1, 2017.  Lease payments of US$2.00 per acre are required, with 
renewal thereof and after commercial discovery.  The State Lease 0-42121 is depicted in orange on Figure 
4-3 below.  CAM has a copy of the lease agreement. 
 
Effective February 2012, the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners has fixed the royalty rate for new 
state-lands uranium leases at 4% of the gross selling price of U3O8.  The rate on renewals of existing state 
leases will be on a case by case basis, but are likely to be at 4% at current economics.  Any lease that has 
already been signed at the rate of 5% will continue, including Strathmore's lease; however, this lease 
form allows for additional deductions.  State of Wyoming royalties apply only to leased state lands. 



 

 

CAM 127117 17 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update

4.4 Private Mineral Lease 
 
On July 28 2010, Strathmore entered into a mineral lease agreement with James D. Sherlock, Mary 
Freezer and Donna Robeson as Trustees for South Pass Land and Livestock Company for two parcels of 
land; 40 acres at the Jeep Project (SEÂ¼SEÂ¼, Sec. 32, T32N, R91W) and 40 acres at the Day Loma Project 
(SWÂ¼SWÂ¼, Sec. 19, T32N, R90W) termed the Sherlock lease.  The mineral lease is good for an initial 
10-year period with indefinite renewal for 10-year periods with additional lease payments.  The mineral 
owner was granted a 5% net production royalty.  The Sherlock lease is depicted as dark blue on Figure 4-
3 below. 
 
The mineral lease holder does not hold title to the two land parcels' surface estates.  On June 21 2011, 
Strathmore entered into a Surface Use and Access Agreement with the land owner, Philip Sheep 
Company, of the 40-acre Day Loma parcel.  The Agreement includes additional lands at Loco-Lee and 
Rock Hill where Strathmore controls the mineral rights but not the surface estates.  CAM has obtained 
copies of the two mentioned agreements.

4.5 Legal Surveys 
 
During previous mining during the 1970's, extensive surveys for patenting of mining claims were 
performed throughout the Gas Hills District, including for hundreds of claims that were formerly located 
on lands now controlled by Strathmore.  However, because of a moratorium on patenting federal mining 
claims, the past Mineral Surveys cannot be used for any future patenting of the lands that the surveys 
covered.

4.6 Environmental Permits 
 
4.6.1 Mineralized Areas, Surface Disturbance, Environmental Liability 
 
The majority of uranium deposits targeted for eventual production by Strathmore lie at depths from 
surface to 450 feet in the main part of the Gas Hills district.  Depths to mineralization reach 1,200 feet 
below the prospective Beaver Rim to the south.  Significant previous drilling and mine production has 
occurred on and adjacent to Strathmore's claims in the Gas Hills.  These surface disturbances consist of 
drill roads, drill sites, haul roads, spoil dumps, and reclaimed, mined-out open-pits.  On Strathmore's 
claims, where examined by CAM, drill pits have been backfilled and leveled, the sites reclaimed, and drill 
holes plugged and abandoned as required by state law.  All physical work performed by Strathmore is 
covered by bonds filed with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) and the US 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  Where work programs have been completed, Strathmore has 
received reduction (revegetation remaining) or complete release of bonding.  No Notices of Violation 
have been received by Strathmore in the Gas Hills. 
 
Several legacy reclamation programs are ongoing in the Gas Hills, including on lands controlled by 
Strathmore.  These programs are carried out by the WDEQ and its Abandoned Mine Lands Division 
(AML) with cooperation of the BLM.  In addition, several former mill tailings sites on adjacent lands 
have been or will be reclaimed and transferred to the US Department of Energy (DOE) for long term care 
and maintenance.  All of this reclamation activity is performed at the sole cost of the state and federal 
government agencies.  State of Wyoming mining regulations will require Strathmore to reclaim any new 
mining activities but excludes Strathmore from any environmental liability associated with historical 
mining on Strathmore's controlled lands.  Strathmore consults with the BLM and WDEQ AML on their 
planned reclamation activities that may impact Strathmore's future mining endeavors. 
 
4.6.2 Exploration Permits 
 
Prior to any exploration or drilling activities in the Gas Hills, Strathmore is required to apply for drilling 
permits with the WDEQ Land Quality Division (WDEQ-LQD) and the BLM.  Prior to issuance of any 
permit, a reclamation bond is posted.  In Wyoming, plugging requirements exist for all drill holes.  Forms 
describing the method of plugging and other required information must be submitted to the State 
Engineer's Office and the WDEQ-LQD within 365 days of encountering water in a drill hole.  Surface 
reclamation (contouring, reseeding) is required. 
 
Strathmore applied for and has received five drilling permits covering parts of six of their properties in 
the main Gas Hills; Bullrush, Jeep, George-Ver, Day Loma, Loco-Lee, Rock Hill, and Tablestakes (the 
proposed heap-leach and plant site area).  In addition, Strathmore applied for and has received three 
drilling permits covering parts of three of their properties in the prospective Beaver Rim area to the south.  



 

 

CAM 127117 20 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

Strathmore has completed necessary plugging and regulatory reporting for abandonment of some or all 
holes drilled prior to 2010 on the properties; the 2010-12 drill holes that required abandonment were 
sealed and plugged properly and surface reclamation was scheduled for completion during autumn 2012. 
 
Table 4-2 shows details of drill permits received by Strathmore to date.

West Diamond DN #417 August 20, 2012 199,500 Active 

 
 
4.6.3 Exploration Drilling Plan of Operations (BLM) 
 
Strathmore submitted a Lower Gas Hills Exploration Drilling Plan of Operations (PoO) to the US BLM 
Wyoming Lander Field Office on August 10, 2012.  Following a BLM review and Strathmore's response 
to comments the PoO was deemed materially complete and posted for public comment.  Subsequent to 
the 30 day public comment period Strathmore received BLM approval of the PoO on February 11, 2013. 
 
The BLM approval of the Strathmore Lower Gas Hills Exploration Drilling Plan of Operations will allow 
exploration drilling over an area of 3,075 acres in the Lower Gas Hills, as defined in the PoO.  Prior to 
approval of the PoO, the area available for exploration drilling was limited to 5 acres of disturbance per 
permit area at any given time for a total of 25 acres.  Approval of the PoO will allow for a significantly 
increased exploration drilling activity on the Strathmore properties. 
 
4.6.4 Mine Site Permitting 
 
Strathmore submitted a Permit to Mine application with the state of Wyoming, Department of 
Environmental Quality, Land Quality Division (WY DEQ-LQD) on October 31, 2012.  The Permit to 
Mine application is currently under a 60 day initial completeness review.  Strathmore will respond to 
comments and requests for additional information from DEQ review, and a final Permit to Mine 
application will be submitted to the DEQ and BLM.  Submittal of the Permit to Mine application to the 



 

 

CAM 127117 21 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

BLM will then trigger the requirement for an Environmental Impact Statement to be completed by a third 
party contractor of BLM choosing, under the guidance of the BLM, and funded by Strathmore. 
 
Conditions and activities described in the Permit to Mine will be regulated by the Wyoming DEQ-LQD 
under a cooperative agreement with the BLM and other federal regulators.  Mining activities allowed 
under the Permit to Mine are defined in a mine and reclamation plan, which must be approved by the 
WDEQ-LQD.  The mine plan is updated annually through a required annual report.  The amount of 
unreclaimed disturbance reported in each annual update establishes the reclamation bond amount.  
Calculation of the bond amount is based on the assumption that a third-party contractor will be required in 
the event of a mining company default of the performance bond. 
 
CAM understands that all baseline information required for the mine permit application has been obtained 
and is in the process of compilation.  This includes information on overburden, hydrology, soil, 
vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources, etc. that will be assessed and evaluated in accordance with WY 
DEQ Guideline No. 6.  These baseline conditions were submitted as specific sections in the mine permit 
application. 
 
State and federal agencies that will provide permits for the mine include: US Bureau of Land 
Management, US Environmental Protection Agency, US Mine Safety and Health Administration, US Fish 
and Wildlife Services, Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Air, Land and Water Quality 
Divisions, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, and Wyoming State Engineer's Office. 
 
4.6.5 Mill Site Permitting 
 
For Strathmore's proposed Gas Hills Heap Leach Recovery Facility, the US Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (US NRC) has the responsibility to issue a source material license to "receive title to, 
receive, possess, use, transfer, or deliver any source material after removal from its place of deposit in 
nature" (CFR 40.1 and 40.3).  Source nuclear material is defined as uranium and/or thorium in any form, 
or ores containing 0.05% or more by weight uranium and/or thorium.  The US NRC is required to 
implement National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations.  This procedure will require an 
approved Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prior to any production activities.  The site will be 
bonded under the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Long-Term Maintenance and Surveillance Fee 
($250,000 in 1978 dollars) that is adjusted per the Consumer Price Index.  Eventually, the reclaimed mill 
and tailings sites will be transferred to the US DOE for perpetual security and monitoring, including a 
portion of the fee to cover the costs of this long term care and maintenance.  CAM understands that data 
and information required to obtain the necessary permits is in the process of being assembled.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
5.1 Topography, Elevation, Physiography 
 
The Gas Hills uranium district is near the geographic center of Wyoming.  It is partly in Fremont County 
and partly in Natrona County, midway between the cities of Casper and Riverton (Figures 4-1 and 4-2).  
Altitude ranges from about 6,000 feet along Muskrat Creek in the northwestern part of the district to a 
little over 8,000 feet in the eastern and southeastern parts.  A steep north-facing escarpment from 400 to 
500 feet high above the surrounding lands, called the Beaver Divide, extends from the southwestern part 
of the district to the east-central and southeastern parts.  The areas north and south of Beaver Divide are 
gently rolling semi-arid sagebrush-covered desert. 
 
5.2 Climate, Vegetation and Wildlife 
 
Climate in the Gas Hills is continental semi-arid, with annual precipitation of 8-12 inches, mostly falling 
in the form of late autumnal to early spring snows.  The summer months are usually hot, dry and clear 
except for infrequent rains.  Because of the dry climate, almost all streams in the area are ephemeral, 
flowing only during storm events or spring snow melt.  Winters are cold and summers are hot.  Year-
around open-pit mining operations were successfully carried out previously in the Gas Hills district, in 
spite of low winter temperatures. 
 
Strathmore contracted with Permits West Inc. of Santa Fe, New Mexico (2012) to gather data on 
vegetation and wildlife as required for drilling permits.  Studies found most common native vegetation is 
sage brush and to lesser extent, rabbit brush.  No threatened or endangered plants were found on the 
properties. 
 
Mule deer and pronghorn antelope are common, as are nesting raptors.  Small rodents and rabbits are 
common.  The Greater Sage Grouse, present in the general area of the project, has been considered for 
listing as a threatened or endangered species.  Successful and ongoing mitigation efforts by the State of 
Wyoming have significantly decreased the probability of regulatory listing of the sage grouse. 
 
5.3 Infrastructure 
 
Extensive production in Wyoming of minerals (coal, trona, uranium) and oil/gas has provided a highly 
skilled labor force in the region.  Population centers within two hours of the Gas Hills project include 
Casper, Riverton, Lander and Rawlins, where equipment and supplies may be obtained.  Paved roads 
from these towns and cities extend to the edge of the Gas Hills project area.  Access and haul roads within 
the project are graded gravel and are maintained by the State, County and mining companies operating in 



 

 

CAM 127117 24

the area.  Functioning power lines, natural gas lines, telephone and fiber optic cable are present on and 
near the Strathmore property (Figure 5-1).  Several wells producing water for domestic and industrial use 
are on or close to Strathmore's mineral properties. 
 
It is CAM's opinion that property controlled by Strathmore is more than adequate to provide area for 
potential tailing storage, waste disposal, heap leach pads, potential processing sites, and any other 
required facilities.

Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

6.0 HISTORY 
 
The Gas Hills Uranium District is one of the major uranium mining and production regions in the USA.  
Total production was approximately 100 million pounds of uranium in the Gas Hills from the mid 1950's 
to late 1980's. 
 
Following the initial discovery of uranium in the district in 1953, a staking rush ensued, and thousands of 
mining claims were staked within a few months (Snow, 1978), and exploration exposed numerous near-
surface oxidized deposits.  Shipments of ore were sent to Edgemont, South Dakota, or to Vitro's mill in 
Salt Lake City, Utah.  By 1959, there were five uranium mills working in the region: Lucky Mc., Split 
rock, Susquehanna, Federal-American Partners, and Globe, Inc. 
 
Following the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania in 1979, the spot price of uranium 
dropped drastically, and the Wyoming uranium mills were put on standby and eventually dismantled.  
The last mill production occurred in 1988 at Lucky Mc. Extensive mill site and mine reclamation 
occurred from the late 1980's through to the present time. 
 
6.1 Historical Mineral Tonnage and Grade Estimates on Strathmore's Gas Hills Project 
 
The following sub-sections present past production information that is available, and historical tonnage 
and grade figures that have been reported on what are now Strathmore's properties (Figure 6-1).  These 
data are from mining companies that were active in the area prior to the implementation of the NI 43-101 
requirements.  A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates 
mentioned in this section as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  Strathmore is not 
treating these historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  Additional 
exploration work needs to be completed in order to determine whether the historical resources can 
be classified as current mineral resources, and thus, the historical figures should not be relied upon. 
 
More than 100,000 exploration and development holes were drilled in the Gas Hills from the mid 1950's 
to 1979.  Since 1990 only a few hundred holes have been drilled, nearly all by Strathmore and Cameco.  
Strathmore recently acquired historical data for several of their Gas Hills properties including Day Loma, 
George-Ver, Loco-Lee and Rock Hill. 
 
The various mining companies that explored for and developed uranium deposits in the Gas Hills during 
the 1950's-1980's used various estimation methods and terms for their estimates.  Essentially all 
companies determined uranium values in drill holes with a gamma-ray probe.  Tonnages were determined 
by various methods: some were done by polygons constructed around mineralized drill holes, other 
estimates were termed "statistical" where various circles of influence were constructed around 



 

 

CAM 127117 27 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update

mineralized drill holes and then statistically summed.  Companies routinely used 16 cubic feet per ton for 
the tonnage factor.    
 
A full discussion of the historical estimates is provided in the following sections.  The summary table of 
historical tonnage and grade estimates is presented in Table 6-1.  The historic estimates should not be 
relied upon, but CAM believes that the historic tonnages and grades are relevant and reliable enough to 
justify further exploration.

The historical resource estimates for Bullrush, Day Loma, George-Ver, Loco-Lee, and Rock Hill have 
been superseded by new mineral resource estimates presented in Section 14 of this report. 

 
 
The historic estimates were completed prior to Strathmore's acquisition of these properties and were done 
by reputable mining companies using accepted engineering practice at the time.  Although the exact 
details of the historic estimates are not available they appear to have been done using the polygonal 
method for grade and grade thickness to calculate tons and pounds.  The polygonal tonnage and grade 
estimate is appropriate for uranium because the selected mining unit (SMU) used in open pit mining is 
approximately the same volume as that sampled by the downhole gamma ray probe.  The primary issue 
with the historic estimates is that not all of the data is of a quality suitable for a NI 43-101 compliant 
disclosure, and in some cases the audit trail for the data is at least partially missing.  CAM believes that 
additional work including confirmation drilling, geophysical logging, sampling and chemical assay 
verification, and other technical support work as deemed necessary, is required in order to verify the 
historical estimates as a current mineral resource, and that this work is warranted.  Strathmore intends to 
complete further evaluation in due course, and while CAM believes that additional drilling and improved 
procedures will result in these historical estimates being upgraded to NI 43-101 compliant mineral 
resource estimates, it is not certain if further work as recommended by CAM will result in the historical

resource estimates being upgraded to NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimates for any or all of 
these properties. 
 
CAM notes that the historical estimates for Bullrush, Day Loma, George-Ver, Loco-Lee, and Rock Hill 
listed in Table 6-1 have been superseded by mineral resource estimates listed in Section 14 (Mineral 
Resource Estimates) of this report.  In addition, these five properties all have "target areas", that have 
potential for identifying additional uranium resources.  These "target areas" are summarized in Section 9 
(Exploration).   
 
The following sections discuss the Day Loma, George-Ver, Loco-Lee, Jeep and Rock Hill properties 
(Figure 6-1).  These properties contain known mineralized areas with abundant historical drilling, and 
where Strathmore has carried out supportive confirmation drilling. 
 
CAM believes that recent Strathmore exploration drilling in historical resource areas during 2011 and 
2012 has confirmed the presence of uranium mineralization in these areas.  Additional details of the 
exploration and drilling activities in historic resource areas are discussed in Sections 9 and 10 
respectively.  CAM estimated resources, defined by this recent drilling, are summarized in Section 14.  
The potential for additional uranium mineralization present in areas of historical resources is discussed in 
Section 9 of this report. 
 
The estimates discussed in Sections 6.1.1 through 6.1.7 were completed prior to the implementation of the 
National Instrument 43-101.  Given the extensive mineral production in the Gas Hills and the fact that the 
estimates were done by reputable mining companies, in addition to the quality of their historical work 
completed, CAM believes these historical resource estimates to be relevant and reliable.  However, a 
qualified person has not completed sufficient work to verify and classify these historical resource 
estimates as current mineral resources, and Strathmore is not treating the historical estimate as a current 
mineral resource.  Additional work including confirmation drilling, sampling and chemical assay 
verification, and other technical support work as deemed necessary, is required in order to verify the 
historical estimate as a current mineral resource.

6.1.1 Day Loma (Western Nuclear/Phelps Dodge/Energy Fuels) Historical Mineral Estimates 
 
Day Loma uranium mineralization was discovered in the 1950's and was later owned by Western Nuclear 
Inc., later acquired by Phelps Dodge. Mining by open pit and underground continued to 1977 and resulted 
in total production of 498,381 tons with a grade of 0.248%, yielding 3,284,593 pounds of U3O8 (Energy 
Fuels Report 1979). 
 
Energy Fuels entered into an agreement with Western Nuclear to purchase the Day Loma property in 
1978 and generated estimates for the remaining, un-mined uranium deposits at Day Loma (457,000 tons 
grading 0.21% eU3O8, for 1,941,000 pounds). 
 
Following their decision to purchase Day Loma from Western Nuclear in 1978, Energy Fuels initiated an 
aggressive drilling program (more than 400 holes) to delineate additional tonnages.  In April 1979, 
Pathfinder Mines completed 200 holes at Day Loma, confirming the mineralization and Energy Fuels' 
tonnage estimates, and extended deposits into untested territory. 
 
In June 1979, Energy Fuels reevaluated the Day Loma estimates following a drilling program, using the 
higher uranium prices at the time, and their preferred mining method--open-pit, for areas that Western 
Nuclear previously calculated tonnages and grades utilizing underground mining cutoffs. 
 
Based on the same method employed in 1978, Energy Fuels increased the historical estimate at Day Loma 
by 70%, from 1,941,000 pounds to 3,317,000 pounds (1,001,000 tons grading 0.16% eU3O8).  Two 
tonnage classes, "proven" and "probable", were combined for a total estimate, which was made by: 
 

"Proven" tonnages were calculated for the area within a 25-foot radius circle about the drill hole 
above the minimum cutoffs (2 feet @ 0.03% eU3O8).  When drill holes were closer than 50 feet, 
the areas were calculated using radii of Â½ the distance to the nearest drill hole. 

"Probable" tonnages were then calculated by extending a straight line tangent to each of the 
contiguous circular zones of influence and computing the total square footage by planimeter.  The 
average thickness and grade % were based on the averages for those "proven" holes within the 
area of the "probable" tonnages.  A total tonnage was calculated for the "probable" area, and then 
the "proven" tonnage subtracted to arrive at the "probable" estimate. 

Density Factor: To change estimate of volume to tonnage an historical district average of 16 cubic 
feet per ton was used. 

 
The "proven" and "probable" tonnage categories assigned to the historical estimates given above 
are not comparable to mineral reserves categories and do not have demonstrated economic 
viability.

Energy Fuels then engaged an outside consultant, David S. Robertson & Associates Inc. (1979) to prepare 
an independent assessment of the mineralization at Day Loma.  That group, which included current author 
Thomas C. Pool (P.E.), estimated the deposit contains 1,172,943 tons with a grade of 0.154 % eU3O8, or 
3.6 million pounds U3O8, with an average thickness of 6.3 feet.  The tonnage and grade estimate is 
historical and should not be relied upon as a NI-43-101 compliant resource.  See complete statement 
regarding historical resources located at the end of Section 6.0. 
 
6.1.2 George â€“Ver (Federal-American Partners' and Pathfinder) Historical Mineral Estimates 
 
Three mining companies, Gas Hills Uranium, Federal Resources, and Radorock Uranium, formed a 
partnership and constructed the central Gas Hills uranium mill. Later Gas Hills Uranium changed its name 
to American Nuclear Corporation (ANC) and Federal Resources acquired Radorock; the subsequent 
mining group was called Federal-American Partners (FAP).  FAP signed an agreement with the 
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the early 1970's to develop uranium ores in the Gas Hills, by open-
pit and underground methods.  In the early 1980's, TVA acquired all of the mining interests of FAP/ANC 
and subsequently sold them to Power Resources Inc. (later Cameco Corporation) in 1991.  Cameco 
maintained many of the claims until the early 2000's, when they dropped their rights to mineralization too 
shallow for in-situ recovery (i.e. Loco-Lee, Bullrush), those claims too near previously mined open-pits 
(Andria, George-Ver, Day Loma, Sunset), and those at greater depths (Beaver Rim properties).   
 
Historical estimates were reported by American Nuclear Corporation (ANC) in 1985.  Historical 
estimates at George-Ver were 1,031,000 tons at a grade of 0.07 % eU3O8 containing 1,493,000 pounds.  
Utilizing the statistical method, also known as area of equal influence (AOI), ANC's geologists generated 
blocks using perpendicular bisectors half the distance between adjacent drill holes.  Minimum cutoffs of 2 
feet and 0.035% eU3O8 were used. 
 
Three classes were estimated: ANC's "indicated" based on drill holes spaced less than 70 feet apart, 
"inferred" based on drill holes spaced less than 100 feet apart, and "potential" based on drill holes spaced 
less than 200 feet apart.  ANC then added each of the tonnages together and reported a "total" tonnage.  It 
should be noted that the historical terminology used by ANC did not use NI 43-101 compliant 
terminology, and the historical tonnages at George-Ver should not be relied upon as compliant resources. 
 
The historic Frazier-Lamac claims were located adjacent to the George-Ver deposit.  They were drilled 
and partially mined by Western Nuclear, and later sold to Pathfinder.  Eventually the claims were dropped 
and subsequently the area they covered became part of the George-Ver claim block of Strathmore (Figure 
6-1). 
 



 

 

CAM 127117 32 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

Pathfinder in 1996 reported the deposit contains 697,000 tons of mineralized material at a grade of 0.11 % 
U3O8 containing 1.52 million lbs.  The tonnage and grade estimate at Frazier-Lamac is historical and 
should not be relied upon.  See complete statement regarding historical resources located at the end 
of Section 6.0. 
 
6.1.3 Loco-Lee (Federal American Partners') Historical Mineral Estimates 
 
The Loco-Lee deposit lies adjacent to the Day Loma property (Figure 6-1) and was part of the Federal-
American Partners property, the history of which is discussed in the previous section.  Loco-Lee was sold 
to Power Resources (later Cameco Corporation).  Cameco dropped the mineral rights to Loco-Lee and 
these were later acquired through claim-staking by Strathmore.  Past production figures for Loco-Lee are 
not available. 
 
American Nuclear, the previous owner in partnership with FAP, reportedly drilled 1,508 holes that 
provided information for the historical tonnage and grade estimates.  Although, not complete, Strathmore 
was able to acquire information on 652 holes from Cameco.  FAP designed a Loco-Lee pit in preparation 
for mining, and it is evident from shape and extent of the proposed pit that many of the missing holes 
contain significant uranium mineralization. 
 
The historical tonnage estimate reported by American Nuclear Corporation in 1985 at Loco-Lee is 
3,369,000 tons at a grade of 0.07% eU3O8, containing 4,644,000 pounds.  Minimum cutoffs of 2 feet and 
0.035% eU3O8 were used.  This estimate is for historical information only and is not to be relied 
upon.  See complete statement regarding historical resources located at the end of Section 6.0. 
 
6.1.4 Bullrush (Federal American Partners') Historical Mineral Estimates 
 
Bullrush consists of several separate uranium deposits about one to two miles west of George-Ver at the 
northwestern extreme of Strathmore's claimed area (Figure 6-1).  They are located on property that once 
was part of Federal American Partners' (FAP; see Section 6.1.1), Western Nuclear's (acquired later by 
FAP), and Union Carbide's historical land positions.  There has been significant historical production 
from the property, predominantly by open-pit methods and to a lesser extent by underground mining.  The 
FAP portion was sold to Power Resources (later Cameco Corp) in 1991.  Cameco dropped the mineral 
rights to Bullrush and these were later acquired through claim-staking by Strathmore.  FAP had 
previously acquired the Western Nuclear mineral rights in the 1960s. 
 
Production records are very limited; however, by 1961 Western Nuclear mined 105,300 tons grading 
0.196% for 412,000 pounds of uranium from four shallow open-pit mines (Dec. 5, 1961 memo from 
Behre-Dolbear to Western Nuclear).  Later, FAP mined additional deposits on their portion (Bullrush, 



 

 

CAM 127117 33

Sagebrush, Tablestakes) of the current property; final production numbers are unknown.  On the west side 
of the Bullrush Property, Union Carbide developed uranium deposits by open-pit mining.  Their "George" 
pits were excavated in the early 1980s to a depth of ~200-250 feet; final production numbers are 
unknown.   
 
In 1985, ANC, in partnership with FAP, reported (American Nuclear Corporation, 1985) remaining 
historical resources on their portion of the current Bullrush Property (based on ~1,350 drill holes) 
including tonnage of 1,737,000 tons at a grade of 0.07% eU3O8 for a total of 2,307,000 pounds of 
contained uranium.  A minimum cutoff of 2 feet and 0.035% eU3O8 was used.  This estimate is for 
historical information only and is not to be relied upon.  See complete statement regarding 
historical resources located at the end of Section 6.0. 
 
6.1.5 Jeep (Federal American Partners') Historical Mineral Estimates 
 
Jeep is a relatively small uranium deposit located about three miles southwest of Day Loma (Figure 6-1.)  
It is located on property that once was part of Federal American Partners land position (see Section 6.1.1).  
There has been no historical uranium production from this property. The ANC and FAP partnership 
(American Nuclear Corporation, 1985) determined a tonnage of 297,000 tons at a grade of 0.08% eU3O8 
for a total of 463,000 pounds of contained uranium.  A minimum cutoff of 2 feet and 0,035% eU3O8 was 
used.  This estimate is for historical information only and is not to be relied upon.  See complete 
statement regarding historical resources located at the end of Section 6.0. 
 
6.1.6 Rock Hill (Adobe-Vipont) Historical Mineral Estimates 
 
The Rock Hill deposits located in the northeast part of the Gas Hills project area lie north of Cameco's 
planned in-situ mining area.  The deposits were discovered in the 1950's as surface outcrop radiometric 
anomalies.  In the 1960's Vipoint Mining Company's drilling defined several near surface uranium 
deposits.  Adobe Oil and Gas Company in 1975 entered into an agreement with Vipont to develop an 
open pit mine.  During 1977-1981, Adobe Oil and Gas Company drilled about 500 development holes in 
addition to 50 core holes to delineate two deposits (Rock Hill and Red Horse) adjacent to several mined 
by Union Carbide and Utah Intl/Pathfinder.  Total past production from the Rock Hill property is 
unknown. 
 
As part of their mine planning and development of the Rock Hill property, Adobe estimated in-place 
recoverable tonnages based on a plan to bulk mine the Rock Hill deposit.  Adobe, estimated a tonnage of 
900,000 tons grading 0.05% eU3O8 for approximately 900,000 pounds uranium.  An estimate of the Red 
Horse deposit was not available.  This estimate is for historical information only and is not to be 



 

 

CAM 127117 34

relied upon.  See complete statement regarding historical resources located at the end of Section 
6.0. 
 
The area of mineralization was drilled on a very close-spacing, 25-50 feet apart, which readily defined the 
geologic characteristics.  CAM believes, from study of drill data, that gamma-ray readings have been 
impacted by disequilibrium, as discussed in Section 12 (Data Verification) of this report. 
 
6.1.7 Allegretti Historical Mineral Estimates 
 
Strathmore's property includes much of the Beaver Rim area, which is located to the south of the target 
areas previously discussed herein.  CAM estimates that approximately 500 to 750 holes were drilled 
above Beaver Rim prior to 1980.  Cameco is currently drilling on their side of the Beaver Rim property 
line in an area known as the Allegretti uranium trend (Figure 9-6).  The Allegretti claim group was 
previously owned by Adobe Oil & Gas Corporation in 1976 (Dames & Moore, 1976.)  Uranium 
mineralization in the Wind River formation was located by drilling in six horizons, each containing roll 
type uranium mineralization. 
 
Two separate areas about 5,000 feet apart were explored by historical drilling.  Twenty exploration holes 
were drilled in the north area, some of which were located on Strathmore property.  Of the twenty holes, 
18 encountered evidence of mineralization on four levels with grades from 0.07 to 0.116 % eU3O8.  The 
depth of mineralization is about 1,200 feet and an estimate of about 440,000 pounds of U3O8 is believed to 
be present.  The south area, located fully on Strathmore Property, was drilled with about 30 exploration 
holes which encountered mineralization at grades from 0.102 to 0.27 % eU3O8 at depths of about 1,200 
feet.  The encountered mineralization is estimated to contain about 313,000 pounds of U3O8 with an 
average grade of 0.19 % (Dames and Moore, 1976).  Strathmore is not treating these historical 
estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  See complete statement regarding 
historical resources located at the end of Section 6.0. 
 
6.2 Summary 
 
Deposits containing the uranium mineralization reported in the above Sections 6.1.1 through 6.1.7 were 
candidates for development in the 1980's, prior to closure of mining activities, due to declining uranium 
prices, in the wake of the Three-Mile Island nuclear reactor disaster in Pennsylvania in 1979.  Strathmore 
controls other known uranium deposits in the Gas Hills but does not have the requisite data to confirm 
their areal extents, depths, thickness, grade and estimated mineral resources.

Techniques for estimating resources were developed by the operating companies in the Gas Hills district 
with input and approval of the U.S. Atomic Energy Agency.  Further, the estimates provided basis for 
effective commercial exploitation of numerous deposits. 
 
CAM believes that recent Strathmore exploration drilling in historical resource areas during 2011 and 
2012 has confirmed the presence of uranium mineralization in these areas.  Additional details of the 
exploration and drilling activities in historic resource areas are discussed in Sections 9 and 10 
respectively.  CAM estimated resources, defined by this recent drilling, are summarized in Section 14.  
The potential for additional uranium mineralization present in areas of historical resources is discussed in 
Section 9 of this report. 
 
The above reported historical estimates were completed prior to implementation of the NI 43-101 
requirements.  A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates 
mentioned in this section as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  Strathmore is not 
treating these historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  Additional 
exploration work needs to be completed in order to classify the historical estimates as current mineral 
resources, and thus, the historical figures should not be relied upon.

7.0 GEOLOGIC SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
7.1 Regional Geology 
 
The Gas Hills Uranium District, located in central Wyoming, is about 100 square miles in area and is 
located within the Wind River Basin that is bounded on the north by the Owl Creek Mountains, on the 
west by the Wind River Mountains, and on the south by the Granite Mountains, part of the Sweetwater 
uplift (Figure 7-1).  These mountain ranges consist of Precambrian crystalline basement rocks overlain by 
unmetamorphosed, mainly marine, Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks (Figure 7-2). 
 
Mountain ranges around the Wind River basin were uplifted during the late Cretaceous to early Tertiary 
Laramide orogeny.  Erosion from these basement-cored uplifts deposited terrestrial clastic sediments of 
the Eocene Wind River formation unconformably upon tilted and deformed Paleozoic-Mesozoic rocks.  
Arkosic sandstones and conglomerates are common in the Eocene Wind River formation and suggest that 
alluvial fan deposits helped fill the basin.  The coarse clastic rocks are up to 1,800 feet thick in the Gas 
Hills area and pinch out against Paleozoic/Mesozoic rocks south of the Gas Hills. 
 
The Eocene Wind River formation is covered with generally conformable layers of tuffaceous 
sedimentary rocks derived from volcanoes active in the region during Oligocene-Miocene times.  
Regional uplift occurred in Pliocene times and the present cycle of erosion.  Sometime during late 
Tertiary time the Granite Mountain block dropped down along east-west faults that lie between the 
mountains and the Gas Hills.  This resulted in a southward regional tilt of the Wind River sediments of 
two to six degrees in the Gas Hills. 
 
7.2 Regional Sedimentary Package 
 
The Cenozoic basin-fill deposits of the Wind River Basin are chiefly flood-plain and stream channel 
materials, with generally greater amounts of lacustrine and pyroclastic sediments toward the top of the 
sequence.  The Eocene formations generally consist of lenticular, poorly sorted sediments, whereas the 
younger Tertiary formations are commonly better sorted and less lenticular in nature.  The majority of the 
volcanic debris was derived from the Yellowstone-Absaroka volcanic field in northwestern Wyoming and 
to a much lesser extent from the Rattlesnake Hills volcanic field immediately east of the Gas Hills (Van 
Houten, 1964).  The sedimentary deposits dip gently a few degrees to the south, having been tilted by 
Late Tertiary collapse of the Granite Mountains and formation of the Split Rock syncline. 
 
The Cenozoic basin-fill deposits exposed in the Gas Hills are, from oldest to youngest, the Wind River 
Formation, Wagon Bed Formation, White River Formation, and the Split Rock Formation.  The arkosic 
sandstones of the Wind River Formation are the host rocks for all economic important quantities of 
uranium mineralization in the Gas Hills.  They were deposited during the period following uplift of the 



 

 

CAM 127117 37 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

ranges surrounding the Wind River Basin and are composed of debris eroded from these highland areas.  
Deposited in alluvial fans, stream channels, lakes, flood plains, and swamps, the Wind River Formation 
varies in thickness from a few feet at the basin margins to several thousand feet thick in the central part of 
the basin to the north of the Gas Hills.  Depositional processes were influenced by the Eocene climate, 
which was mostly humid, warm-temperate to sub-tropical in nature (Seeland, 1978).  The younger basin-
fill sediments (Wagon Bed, White River, Split Rock) are increasingly finer-grained than those arkosic 
sands of the Wind River Formation, in addition to having substantially more volcanic detritus. 
 
7.3 Geologic Setting of the Gas Hills Uranium District 
 
Much of the following information is abstracted from work by the U.S Geological Survey (Armstrong, 
1970).  Very little has been published on geology of the district since the collapse of the nuclear industry 
in 1979, following the Three Mile Island incident. 
 
In the Gas Hills district, lower Tertiary rocks unconformably overlie folded and faulted Mesozoic and 
older rocks (Figure 7-2).  The Wind River Formation, 400 to 800 feet thick, is conformably overlain by 
tuffaceous sandstones of the Eocene Wagon Bed Formation, which is 300 to 700 feet thick (Figure 7-4 ). 
 
Soister (1968, p.9) in studying a larger area, divided the Wind River Formation into three units:  (1) the 
lower fine-grained member, (2) the Puddle Springs arkose member, and (3) the upper fine-grained 
transition member (Figure 7-3). 
 
The Puddle Springs arkose member of the Wind River Formation is the host rock for the uranium 
deposits.  It consists of poorly consolidated arkosic sandstone and conglomerate with thin discontinuous 
interbeds of mudstone.  The Puddle Springs arkose was deposited rapidly by northward-flowing braided 
streams to form coalescing piedmont alluvial fans (Soister, 1968.)  Mudstone interbeds are probably 
overbank deposits on floodplains.  The provenance was the Granite Mountains a short distance to the 
south. 
 
The full thickness of the Wind River is present from just north of the base of Beaver Divide southward for 
a few miles.  North of the contact between Wind River and post-Wind River rocks, erosion has cut across 
strata at a low angle and the formation progressively thins to a feather edge at its northern margin, where 
basal beds lie unconformably on older rocks.

7.3.1 Description of Stratigraphic Units of the Gas Hills 
 
The following lithologic descriptions were modified from Van Houten (1964), Soister (1968), Anderson 
(1969) and Love (1970).  Geologic map of the Gas Hills is shown in Figure 7-2 and a stratigraphic 
column of the formations encountered is shown on 7-3.  Following is a general description of units 
Indicated with letter symbols in Figure 7-2.  
 
Tsr:  Split Rock Formation (Miocene) has a basal conglomerate 10-15 feet thick with cobbles up to 15 
inches diameter.  Massive tuffaceous sandstone with thin interbeds of sandy limestone, and lenses of 
pebble conglomerate overlies the basal conglomerate.  The formation is about 150 feet thick in the Gas 
Hills area as exposed atop Beaver Rim, but is not exposed to the north of the Rim. 
 
Twr:  White River Formation (Oligocene) is a bentonitic and tuffaceous yellowish-gray to grayish-
orange mudstone with lenses of arkosic sandstone, conglomerate and beds of vitric tuff.  This unit 
contains basal arkosic sandstone (Big Sand Draw Sandstone), with lenses of pebbly conglomerate.  The 
basal unit is overlain by conglomerate (Beaver Divide Conglomerate) in the west part of the Wind River 
Basin.  The formation is ~100 feet thick in the Gas Hills area as exposed along the Beaver Rim, with little 
to none of the formation exposed north of the Rim.  
 
Tw:  Wagon Bed Formation (Late Eocene) in the Gas Hills is divided into five informal sub-units.  The 
basal unit 1 is a 10-20 feet thick mudstone.  This is overlain by Unit 2 which is composed primarily of 
sandstone and bentonitic mudstone.  Unit 3 is an altered biotite vitric tuff with locally interbedded 
volcanic sandstones and siltstones.  Unit 4 contains volcanic claystone, siltstone and sandstone, and the 
upper portion contains silicified mudstone and tuff.  The uppermost unit 5 is composed of volcanic 
mudstone, arkosic sandstone, and conglomerate.  The formation is ~100-150 feet thick in the Gas Hills 
area, lies conformably atop the Wind River Formation and is exposed mostly along the Beaver Rim 
escarpment.  
 
Twdr:  Wind River Formation (Early Eocene) in the Gas Hills has been divided (Soister, 1968) into 
three informal members (upper transition zone, middle zone, lower zone).  In general, the formation is a 
yellowish-gray variegated mudstone, sandstone, and conglomerate lenses.  Sandstone generally is arkosic 
to sub-arkosic, and contains local tuffaceous beds in the upper part.  The formation is 500-600 feet thick 
in the Gas Hills area and lies unconformably atop the older, folded and faulted Mesozoic deposits.  The 
following details the three sub-units of Soister (1968): 
 

Upper Transition Zone is 50-100 feet thick and consists of an interbedded mudstones and coarse 
arkosic sandstone. 



 

 

CAM 127117 39

Puddle Springs Arkose Member (Middle Zone) is the host for the uranium mineralization, and is 
20 to 300 feet thick, depending upon location and the underlying paleotopography.  Two types of 
sandstones are present in the Puddle Springs Arkose member.  The first, a yellowish-orange to 
yellowish-gray arkose, was primarily derived from pre-Cambrian gneissic and granitoid rocks.  It 
contains limonite and calcium carbonate cement but little clay matrix.  The second type of 
sandstone is derived from pre-Cambrian schists, contains little carbonate cement, much 
micaceous clay and is interbedded with mudstone containing chlorite.  About 90% of the 
sediments were derived from the pre-Cambrian granitic source rocks. 

 
Lower Zone is composed primarily of grayish-green siltstone, gray fine- to very fine-grained quartz 

sandstone, and grayish-green claystone.  Basal conglomerate and carbonaceous beds are also 
present.  The lower zone is 0-130 feet thick in the southern Wind River Basin, and its occurrence 
and thickness are related to the variably eroded surface on which this unit was deposited.  The 
sediments of the lower zone are characteristic of the eroded Mesozoic and Paleozoic source 
rocks. 

 
Pre-Cenozoic Strata (PreCen) in the Gas Hills are from Cambrian to Cretaceous in age.  Paleozoic 
sediments, averaging 2,000 feet thick, include rocks of Cambrian, Mississippian, Pennsylvanian and 
Permian ages; they consist mostly of sandstone, limestone and dolomite.  Mesozoic sediments, averaging 
10,000 feet thick, include rocks of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous ages and consist mostly of shale and 
some sandstone.  All of the pre-Cenozoic rocks were extensively deformed during Early Eocene faulting, 
uplift, and basin development associated with the Laramide Orogeny.  The pre-Cenozoic deposits are 
exposed in erosional windows throughout the Gas Hills District.

7.4 Geologic Setting of Mineralization in the Gas Hills Uranium District 
 
In the Gas Hills district, lower Tertiary rocks unconformably overlie folded and faulted Mesozoic and 
older rocks (Figure 7-2).  The Eocene Wind River Formation, 400 to 800 feet thick in the Gas Hills, is 
conformably overlain by tuffaceous sandstones of the Eocene Wagon Bed Formation, which is 300 to 700 
feet thick (Figure 7-3). 
 
Southward beneath Beaver Rim the Wind River thins to a feather edge by onlap over older rocks. The 
Wind River Formation dips 1 to 5 degrees southeast.  The dip, the higher altitude of the surface south of 
Beaver Divide, and local faulting all combine to place the base of the Wind River much deeper below the 
surface south of Beaver Divide than north of it. 
 



 

 

CAM 127117 41 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update

The Gas Hills uranium deposits are present in an arkosic sandstone facies (i.e. Puddle Springs member of 
the Wind River formation.)  Knowledge of the distribution of this member is of great importance in the 
search for uranium deposits, as permeability seems to determine whether a rock is a favorable or 
unfavorable host.  Fine-grained, only slightly permeable rocks are unfavorable hosts.  Highly porous 
conglomerates, on the other hand, appear to be too permeable to be a good host rock. 
 
Mineralized trends are developed in the arkosic facies.  The Bullrush, Day Loma and Loco-Lee deposits 
are hosted in the Puddle Springs member in the west Gas Hills trend.  The George-Ver deposit is located 
in the Puddle Springs member in the Central trend; and the Rock Hill deposit is located in the Puddle 
Springs member in the eastern Gas Hills trend. 
 
Drilling in the west Gas Hills indicates that the favorable arkosic sandstone host passes westward into 
unfavorable silty facies.  A local sandstone facies has been found within the silty facies, and a small area 
containing uranium (Jeep deposit) has been found in the sandy facies.  Thus the favorable host for 
mineralization in the above mentioned deposits (Figure 7-3) seems to be bounded on the north by an 
erosional pinchout; on the east by a change of facies to an unfavorable silty sandstone host; on the south 
by a subsurface onlap pinchout; and on the west by change of facies to an unfavorable silty sandstone 
host.

7.5 Uranium Mineralization 
 
Uranium mineralization in the Gas Hills is present in bodies usually referred to as "rolls."  In vertical 
cross section they are irregularly crescent shaped (Figure 7-4, 7-5).  Rolls are the result of oxidized and 
soluble uranium being transported by ground water to a location within a permeable sandstone host where 
a reaction within a reducing environment occurs and insoluble reduced uranium minerals are deposited.  
The contact between oxidized and reduced conditions is the "roll front". 
 
In the body of the crescent, individual rolls range from a few inches to many feet in vertical thickness.   
Average thickness of a well mineralized roll is 10 to 15 feet; many rolls thicker than 20 feet have been 
mined.  The upper and lower horns of the crescent thin away from the body of the crescent.  In the Gas 
Hills the lower horn normally is greatly extended and thins gradually, whereas the upper horn is short and 
thins abruptly. 
 
On the concave side of a crescent-shaped mineralized body, relatively light gray colored altered host rock 
is present.  The contact is a slightly irregular narrow zone, and the change from uranium-bearing to 
bleached or altered rock normally takes place within a distance of three inches or less (Figure 7-5). 
 
On the convex side of a crescent shape mineralized body, relatively dark greenish-gray unbleached 
(unaltered) rock is present.  The contact between uranium-bearing and unbleached or unaltered rock is an 
extremely irregular interfingering, mostly gradational feature but the contact between individual fingers 
of mineralized rock and unbleached host may be moderately sharp.  The fingers of mineralized rock point 
in the direction of unbleached rock; this direction can be thought of as the direction in which the roll is 
facing. 
 
Upper-limb mineralization dies out away from the body of the crescent in an abrupt manner somewhat 
similar to that of the contact between uranium-bearing and bleached rock on the concave side of the 
crescent.  In contrast, lower limb mineralization normally terminates gradually in the way that ore 
terminates on the convex side of a roll.

The photo shown in Figure 7-5 illustrates classic Wyoming-type uranium roll-front exposed during 
construction of a reclamation channel on the George-Ver Property (Figure 6-1).  The depth to this ore 
deposit is about 30 feet; this deposit remains un-mined. 
 
The crescent-shaped contact between bleached rock and uranium mineralization is commonly referred to 
as a "front".  In mapping a front, the point of maximum advance of the altered rock is plotted (Figure 7-
9).  In plan view, the trace of a front is extremely sinuous.  A front, because of its extreme sinuosity, can 
face in almost any direction. 
 
Rolls ordinarily are stacked en echelon (Figure 7-8), forming multiple mineralized bodies.  A series of 
stacked rolls can be thought of a frontal system.  The number of rolls and vertical separation between 
them can be large or small, and as a result, mineralization may occur through a large stratigraphic 
interval.  In the Central Gas Hills, ore has been found in a stratigraphic interval almost 300 feet thick. 
 
Most rolls are stacked so that each successively higher roll is displaced in the direction of convexity 
(Figure 7-8)â€”the volume of bleached rock narrows with depth.  Each roll in a stack has its own front and 
each front in plan view has its own sinuosity.  The different fronts occur in the same general area, but the 
detailed sinuosity of one roll is independent of the sinuosity of other rolls. 
 
Rolls and lower-limb mineralized bodies normally are underlain by a mudstone layer.  In many places a 
mudstone layer also overlies the roll (Figure 7-8).  The upper limbs of some mineralized bodies end in 
sandstone and the next higher roll rests on a mudstone layer that is separated from the lower roll by un-
mineralized sandstone. 
 
Un-oxidized mineralization is dark and usually, the darker the ore the higher the grade (Figure 7-6).   The 
uranium minerals are very fine grained uraninite and a little coffinite.  The only non-silicate gangue 
minerals present in significant amounts are fine-grained pyrite and marcasite, and they are intimately 
mixed with uranium minerals. These minerals coat detrital sand grains and fill interstices of the host rock.  
Oxidized mineralization is present near surface and was mined when production in the district first started 
(Figure 7-7).  Most production came from un-oxidized mineralization and essentially all present 
mineralization of potential economic interest is contained in un-oxidized mineralization. 
 
Uranium is not distributed uniformly throughout the roll, rather, it is normally concentrated in the body of 
the crescent close to the concave side (Figure 7-5).  High-grade mineralization locally contains several 
percent U3O8 per ton.  The grade progressively decreases away from the high-grade zone.  In the direction 
of bleached rock the grade decreases abruptly and there is a sharp break between mineralization and 
waste.  In the direction of unbleached rock, grade decreases gradually.  The high- grade zone in the body 
of the crescent and the area immediately adjacent to it contains most of the total uranium in the body.

Most of the uranium produced from the Gas Hills has come from this location in rolls, and therefore most 
future production can logically be expected to come from similar positions in other rolls.

Uranium was discovered in the Gas Hills near the center of the district at the north end of what later 
became known as the Central Gas Hills.  As exploration continued, uranium was found at widely 
scattered localities and after a while it became evident that uranium occurrences were concentrated in 
three separate areas: a western area, a central area, and an eastern area.  As work continued these areas 
became known as the west ore trend, central ore trend, and east ore trend (Figure 7-9).  Each trend was 
considered to be a separate entity until about 1963, when it was realized that the different ore trends might 
be parts of a single complex geologic feature (Armstrong, 1970).  Now it seems certain that the West and 
Central Gas Hills are parts of a single featureâ€”a frontal systemâ€”and it is very likely that the East Gas 
Hills is another part of the same feature.  Strathmore's claim block covers much of the complex frontal 
system (Figure 9-1).

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
Uranium deposits in the Gas Hills are classic Wyoming-type roll-front deposits.  Roll-front type uranium 
deposits (also called roll-type by the U.S. Geological Survey) are irregular in shape, roughly tabular and 
elongated, and range from thin pods a few feet in width and length, to bodies several hundred or 
thousands of feet in length.  Many features of these deposits are described in the preceding section of this 
report.  Roll-front uranium mineralization is also discussed in detail in the following reports:  Anderson 
(1969), Adler (1964), Armstrong (1970), Granger and Warren (1974, 1978), King et al. (1965), King and 
Austin (1966), Shawe (1965), and Shawe and Granger (1965), to name a few. 
 
The Gas Hills district is second in U.S. uranium production, about 100 million pounds, only to the Grants 
district of northwest New Mexico.  Significant amounts of the Grants uranium production came from roll-
front deposits as well.  Crescent-shaped uranium deposits of the Shirley basin uranium district, Wyoming 
are very similar to the Gas Hills deposits (Harshman, 1972).  Roll-front uranium deposits also have been 
found in the Powder River basin, Wyoming (Davis, 1972), and also are the host for significant uranium 
production in southern Texas (Eargle and others, 1975), at Crowe Butte, Nebraska, Kazakhstan, and in 
Russia (Germanov, 1960).  Typically, Wyoming roll-front uranium deposits occur in clusters (Finch, 
1996) and a cluster of deposits generally contains from 500 to 20,000 tons of U3O8 at grades from 0.04 to 
0.23 percent U3O8.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 
9.1 Exploration Methodology 
 
CAM believes that the very large land position of claims held by Strathmore covering most of the known 
Gas Hills mineralization trends places it in a favorable position to generate targets for significant tonnages 
of uranium mineralization. 
 
Exploration for roll-front uranium deposits requires drilling for discovery, development and definition of 
economic deposits.  Initial drilling is wide spaced to gather geologic information, including presence of 
alteration bleaching, traces of mineralization and stratigraphic information.  The latter along with the 
gamma signature from the logging probe, is used to guide location of subsequent drill holes.  This is 
standard procedures in exploration for roll-front uranium deposits, and is used by Strathmore. 
 
Uranium values in exploration holes have been based on down-hole gamma-ray log probes.  Strathmore 
has its own logging equipment and each hole is probed immediately following drilling of the hole.  
Equivalent uranium values, expressed as eU3O8, are obtained from the gamma logs, assuming that 
uranium and its daughter products are in radiogenic equilibrium.  The probes are standardized and 
calibrated using test pits operated by the U.S. Department of Energy, located in Casper, Wyoming and 
Grand Junction, Colorado. 
 
Starting in 2011 and continuing through the 2012 program of drilling, Strathmore also employed a 
Company-owned Prompt-Fission-Neutron (PFN) probe together with a gamma-ray probe.  The PFN 
probe, when properly calibrated, measures uranium content directly.  PFN analysis assesses the quantity 
of uranium present surrounding a drill hole directly, by measuring those neutrons resulting from fission of 
the 235U isotope.  This eliminates the uncertainties inherent in measuring gamma-ray intensities resulting 
from decay of uranium daughter products, which may be subjected to selective remobilization due to the 
varying chemical properties of each daughter element.  Even so, it is still necessary to validate PFN 
results by comparison to chemical assay data from drill core or cuttings.  It is anticipated that, through 
regular ongoing use of PFN with its associated calibration checks and continuing checks against existing 
or historical core holes, a background of validity can be achieved which will reduce the number and 
frequency of future chemical-assay checks. 
 
Strathmore also employs core drilling through mineralized units.  Properties or targets drilled with core 
holes by Strathmore from 2007 to 2012 are indicated in Table 10-1.  Six core holes were drilled at the 
George-Ver property in October 2010. These cores were used for base line studies required for 
permitting; no systematic program of chemical assays for uranium was implemented for these holes. 
 



 

 

CAM 127117 53 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

Starting in May 2012 Strathmore carried out  a systematic program of core drilling through mineralized 
units with the specific objective of obtaining chemical assays for uranium.  The resulting core was sent to 
accredited commercial labs for uranium assay; Intermountain Lab in Sheridan, Wyoming (accredited by 
the U.S. EPA, USNRC, and several states) and Hazen Research Inc. in Golden, Colorado (accredited by 
U.S. EPA and by NELAP -National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program).  Drill holes with 
core assays are listed and discussed in Section 10 (Drilling) of this report describing drilling activities for 
each property. 
 
Beginning in May 2012, Strathmore has used an outside contractor (GAA Wireline Inc.) to log holes, and 
to verify the Strathmore PFN and Gamma logging readings. 
 
Comparison of results from gamma readings, PFN readings, and chemical assays can be used to assess 
the extent of radiogenic equilibrium or disequilibrium in the contained mineralization.  See Section 12 
(Data Verification) for a discussion on disequilibrium.  
 
Strathmore, in 2012, carried out confirmation drilling within the Lower Gas Hills on the Day Loma, 
George-Ver, Loco-Lee, Rock Hill and Bullrush properties, and also drilled exploration target areas 
located above Beaver Rim within their large claim block as shown on Figure 9-1.  Details of this drilling 
are summarized in Section 10 (Drilling) of this report.  This recent drilling indirectly supports historical 
information on uranium mineralization (depth, thickness and grade).  If fully supported, historical drill 
information can be used to generate mineral resource estimates as discussed in Section 14 (Mineral 
Resource Estimates) of this report.  Strathmore also undertook some drilling along trends beyond 
historically-defined mineralization, with the aim of enlarging the known mineralized areas. 
 
Neither Strathmore nor CAM has access to many of the details of past exploration carried out in the 
1950's through 1970's, but many of the summary reports describing past activities in the Gas Hills 
district, now in possession of Strathmore, were examined by CAM.  CAM believes these past exploration 
activities, mostly directed by well-known companies, were done in a manner consistent with industry best 
practices at the time, and that the information in these reports is reasonably accurate and reliable. 
 
Exploration activities carried out by Strathmore in each of the active project areas on Strathmore claims is 
briefly summarized in Sections 9.2 through 9.9.  Drilling and logging procedures used by Strathmore are 
consistent with best practices, and land status monuments and records are verifiable and in good order. 
Strathmore's drilling is discussed in more detail in Section 10.  Analyses of data accuracy and reliability 
are further discussed in Section 11 (Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security) and Section 12 (Data 
Verification).

9.2 Bullrush Exploration 
 
The general location of the Bullrush West-29 exploration target is shown in Figure 9-1.  This target is an 
area of about 3,500 feet north-south, by 1,300 feet east-west as shown in Figure 9-2.  Union Carbide 
drilled and partly developed an historic deposit located along the west side of Bullrush West-29, and 
completed plans for open pit mining in the 1980's.  Immediately west of the West-29 target, Union 
Carbide mined the George pits to depths of approximately 200 feet in the late 1970's.  Production results 
from the George pits are unavailable.  Strathmore drilled nine holes in the Bullrush West 29 target in 
2011 and results of this exploration drilling are reported in the previous 43-101 report (Nielsen, Pool & 
Sandefur, 2012). 
 
Federal American Partners (FAP) drilled an area of mineralization immediately adjacent to the southeast 
corner of the West 29 target.  FAP designed a pit for mining in 1982 (Figure 9-4.)   
 
Strathmore drilled 58 rotary holes and three core holes in the Bullrush target in 2012.  Eleven rotary holes 
and one core hole were drilled in the FAP proposed pit area.  Forty-seven rotary holes and two core holes 
were drilled in the West 29 target.  Results of the 2012 drilling are summarized in Section 10, and drill 
hole locations are shown in Figure 10-1.  Based on the Strathmore drilling, CAM generated a compliant 
inferred mineral resource for the Bullrush West-29 deposit (see Section 14).  Additional potential exists 
on Bullrush as discussed below in Section 9.9.1.

9.3 Day Loma Exploration 
 
Uranium mineralization at Day Loma trends southeast for 2,000 feet from the east open pit to the most 
distant area of systematic block drilling (Figure 9-3).  Strathmore drilled 39 confirmation holes, and 
installed 2 monitor wells, in 2010-11 and results of this drilling are reported in a previous NI43-101 
report (Nielsen, Pool & Sandefur 2012.)  Further drilling of 25 confirmation holes occurred in 2012 as 
indicated in Figure 9-3 and Figure 10-4; the results of this recent drilling are discussed in Section 10. 
 
Strathmore drilled a monitor well (DLS-MW-1) to a depth of 600 feet in 2010 approximately 1,500 feet 
east of the last known historical drilling at Day Loma (Figures 9-1, 9-3 and 9-7).  This monitor well 
intersected a mineralized layer 15 feet thick grading 0.032% eU3O8 at a depth of 484 to 499 feet.  
Although not high grade, this level of mineralization and the gamma signature of the drill log suggests 
that the roll-front system continues into this area from the known Day Loma historic deposit. 
 
Strathmore carried out a program of exploration drilling to test for uranium mineralization roughly 
equidistant between the mineralized monitor well mentioned above and the last known area of historical 
drilling.  Seventeen holes were drilled along two northeast-trending lines, each 800 to 1000 feet long, 
about 200 feet apart. 
 
Historical drilling was done in an area about 2000 to 3000 feet north-northeast of the open pit mine 
(Figures 9-1 and 10-4.)  Strathmore drilled 20 confirmation holes in this area, informally called the Day 
Loma Northeast Area.  Results of this recent drilling are discussed in Section 10.   
 
Based on the Strathmore confirmation drilling CAM generated both indicated and inferred Mineral 
Resources for the Day Loma project.  Additional potential exists on the Day Loma project as discussed 
below in Section 9.9.2.

9.4 George-Ver Exploration 
 
Extensive historical drilling was done on the greater George-Ver property as located in Figure 9-1 and 
Figure 9-4.  However, Strathmore has been unable to locate the complete historical database, and did 
purchase the former George and Ver claims Federal American Partners database from Cameco in 2010.  
From 2007 to 2011, Strathmore drilled 22 exploration and confirmation holes (including 6 cored holes) in 
the George-Ver target located adjacent to the northwest edge of the former Lucky Mc open-pit mine 
(Figures 9-4 and 10-10).  Three monitor wells were installed to gather necessary data for inclusion in a 
Mine Permit application.  Results of this 2007-2011 drilling were reported in the previous NI 43-101 
report (Nielsen, Pool and Sandefur, 2012.) 
 
Strathmore continued drilling at George-Ver and completed 43 rotary holes in 2012.  Additionally, five 
cored holes were completed for chemical assay purposes.  Drilling was concentrated in three areas in this 
most recent campaign.  About 12 rotary holes and seven core holes were drilled in the area immediately 
west and northwest of the old Lucky Mc open-pit mine. 
 
About 24 rotary holes were drilled in an area of very little known historical drilling just west of the open 
pit Lucky Mc mine.  Two east-west lines of holes were spaced about 200 feet apart, with holes space 
about 200 feet apart along each line. 
 
About 17 rotary holes were drilled just south of the old open-pit mine in an area of moderate to extensive 
historical drilling.  The majority of the 2012 additional drilling was conducted in the George-Ver Deposit 
area outlined in red as shown in Figure 9-4.  Results of the 2012 drilling data are discussed in further 
detail in Section 10, and drill hole locations are shown in Figure 10-10. 
 
CAM generated indicated and inferred Mineral Resources for a portion of the George-Ver project area 
(see Section 14) covered by the historic ANC/FAP database.  Additional historical estimates for a portion 
of the George-Ver property known as Frazier-Lamac (see Section 6.1.2 & Table 6-1) requires additional 
confirmation drilling to verify the resource.  Additional exploration potential exists on the property as 
discussed below in Section 9.9.3.

9.5 Loco-Lee Exploration 
 
Strathmore drilled 17 exploration and confirmation holes at Loco-Lee in 2010 and 2011.  Results of the 
2010 and 2011 drilling are discussed in the previous NI 43-101 report (Nielsen, Pool and Sandefur, 2012).  
During 2012 Strathmore drilled 51 rotary holes and seven core holes at Loco-Lee.  About 38 of the rotary 
holes and six core holes were drilled in an area of extensive past historical drilling.  These confirmation 
holes were drilled along nine east-west lines spaced 100 feet apart, and holes were, for the most part, 
spaced 100 feet along each line.  About 13 holes were drilled as exploration holes located to the north and 
west of the area of dense drilling.  Location of the 2012 exploration drill holes is shown in Figure 10-13, 
and results of all 2012 drilling are discussed in Section 10 of this report.  Based on the Strathmore

drilling, CAM generated a compliant inferred resource for a portion of the Loco-Lee property (see Section 
14).  Additional potential exists on Loco-Lee as discussed in Section 9.9.4..  
 
9.6 Rock Hill Exploration 
 
The Rock Hill historic deposit is located in the northeast part of the Gas Hills project area, north of 
Cameco's planned in-situ mining area as shown in Figure 9-1.  The Rock Hill property contains an area of 
historic open pit mining.  In this present report the area north of the mined area is informally called the 
Red Horse target area.  The area south of the historic open pit mine and north of the claim boundary is 
regarded as the Rock Hill deposit. 
 
Drilling by Vipoint Mining Company in the 1960's and by Adobe Oil & Gas Company, 1977 to 1981, 
reportedly defined a near surface resource (see Section 6.1.5 of this present report). 
 
Strathmore conducted a program of confirmation drilling and completed 12 rotary holes in April 2011.  
Data from the 2011 drill holes is summarized and discussed in a previous NI 43-101 report (Nielsen, Pool 
and Sandefur, 2012)   In 2012 Strathmore drilled 37 rotary holes, four core holes for chemical assays, and 
installed three monitor wells.  Results of the 2012 drilling are summarized in Section 10, and drill hole 
locations are shown in Figure 10-17.  Based on the additional drilling by Strathmore in 2012, CAM 
generated a revised inferred mineral resource for the Rock Hill deposit (Section 14).   
 
The Red Horse target area is located on the Rock Hill property, just north of the mined out open pit.  
Strathmore drilled four rotary holes at Red Horse to confirm results of historical core drilling by Adobe 
Oil and Gas Company, 1977 to 1981.  CAM believes from study of drill data that the mineralization in the 
area has been seriously modified by disequilibrium as discussed in Section 12 (Data Verification) of this 
report.  As a result, additional drilling, PFN logging, and coring will be required to verify historical 
drilling. 
 
9.7 Jeep Exploration 
 
Jeep is a relatively small deposit located about three miles southwest of Day Loma, as shown in Figure 9-
1.  Jeep was once part of Federal American Partners (AFP) land position.  FAP estimated an historical 
resource of 297,000 tons at a grade of 0.08% eU3O8 for a total of 463,000 pounds of contained uranium at 
Jeep. 
 
Strathmore, in 2007, drilled 40 holes to confirm and better define the mineralization.  These holes 
extended the Jeep deposit to the south in an area 1,000 feet by 300 feet into previously untested area.  No

exploration drilling was done in 2011 and 2012.  Additional potential exists at the Jeep property as 
discussed under Section 9.9.6. 
 
9.8 Tablestakes Exploration 
 
The Tablestakes Project Area is new for this report and is located southeast of Strathmore's proposed Gas 
Hills Uranium Recovery Facility as shown in Figure 9-1.  Part of this mineral target, an area historically 
termed Amazon by Federal American Partners, has a historical estimate (ANC, 1985) of 285,000 tons 
grading 0.06% for a total of 366,000 pounds of uranium as described in Section 6 (History) and shown in  
Table 6-1.  The Strathmore exploration target is the eastern extension of the pits historically mined by 
Union Carbide in the early 1980s. 
 
In 2012 Strathmore drilled 19 holes in the Tablestakes target area.  Results of the drilling are presented in 
Section 10, and location of the holes is shown in Figure 10-20.  Due to the limited number and greater 
spacing (up to 400 feet apart) of the 2012 drilling, no mineral resource estimates were generated for this 
report.  However, results of the drilling, including 14.5 feet of 0.079% PFNU3O8 at a depth of 229.5 feet in 
hole TSS-07, tends to support the historically defined resource and the area appears favorable for 
discovery of additional uranium mineralization, as discussed in Section 9.9.5. 
 
9.9 Remaining Potential Mineral Targets, Main Gas Hills Properties 
 
"Target areas" that have potential for discovery of additional uranium mineralization are briefly described 
in this section of the report, and are located on Figure 9-5.  Each of these mineral target areas are believed 
to contain uranium mineralization.  Usually mineralization was cut by exploration drill holes, or 
mineralization may be projected from known occurrences into the target areas.  Features and 
characteristics such as grade, length of mineralized trend, width and thickness of mineralization are 
inferred from geologic features and from nearby areas containing well defined mineralized bodies.  All 
the estimates are based on a tonnage factor of 16 cubic feet per short ton, as used by historical operators 
in the district. 
 
The potential mineral resource estimates by CAM presented below are pursuant to NI 43-101 Standards 
for Disclosure for Mineral Project guidelines, Section 2.3 (2), which states that "subject to the provisions 
thereof an issuer may disclose the potential quantity and grade, expressed as ranges, of a target for further 
exploration."

It is important to stress that these target areas for mineralization are conceptual and the mineral potential 
estimates are not based upon NI 43-101 guidelines for reporting mineral resources.  Exploration activities 
in each target area are not sufficient to define a NI 43-101 mineral resource and there is not geologic or 
exploration data to ensure that further exploration activities will result in a defined resource in each target 
area.  The estimate potential mineralization discussed for each target is merely a guide for further 
exploration. 
 
9.9.1 Bullrush Target 
 
At Bullrush, Strathmore completed necessary core assaying and PFN/gamma logging across the area of 
the Bullrush West-29 target and a small portion of the area covered by the historical FAP drilling and 
1982 pit designs (Figure 9-6), providing CAM the confidence to generate a compliant inferred resource 
(see Section 14).  However, since Strathmore explored only a fraction of the area covered by the historical 
FAP drilling and historical Bullrush mineral resource (Section 6.1.4) the remainder of the property has 
potential for additional mineralization that with additional test drilling may be elevated to a compliant 
resource.  The areas of potential mineralization are shown on Figure 9-7, and consist of the portions of the 
historically designed pits not drilled and the areas between.    
 
With an overall trend length of 3,000 to 3,600 feet, a width of 150 feet and a thickness of 12 feet, a 
potential tonnage associated with this area of Bullrush ranges from 0.34 to 0.40 mm tons.  With the range 
in grade of 1.6 to 3.4 lbs U3O8 the potential mineralization ranges from 0.5 to 1.4 mm lbs U3O8, likely 
accessible by open-pit methods.

9.9.2 Day Loma Southeast and Northeast Targets 
 
The potential mineral target is the east-southeast projection of known mineralization at the Day Loma 
property.  Some exploration drilling was completed in this target area in 2012 and results are discussed in 
Section 10 of the present report.  At Day Loma, extensive drilling indicates mineral grades ranging from 
0.12 to 0.24% eU3O8.  CAM's estimate of the potential range of mineral grade at the Day Loma SE target 
uses 0.10% on the low end and 0.20% U3O8 on the high end.  The estimated range of mineralization width 
is 300 to 750 feet, which is the range of width of mineralization in the un-mined mineralization at Day 
Loma.  The length of remaining mineralization not included in the new mineral resource estimate is 
approximately 1,300 feet.  The range of thickness is estimated at 2 to 13 feet, the range indicated in the 
Day Loma deposit.  Average thickness of mineralization is estimated at 4 to 7.5 feet in the target area. 
 
CAM believes a reasonable estimate of remaining resource potential for the Day Loma SE Trend lies 
between 0.2 and 1.8 million pounds of contained U3O8, based upon information projected from historic 
drilling for a distance of approximately 1,300 feet remaining to explore in the target area.  Most of this 
potential should likely be at depths where it can be mined from open pits.  Additional potential exists on 
the remainder of the Day Loma property, especially to the north in the Northeast target area  
 
For the Day Loma NE mineral target, using a trend length of 1,000 feet, a width of 300 to 600 feet, and 
thickness of 4 to 8 feet, a range of potential tonnage is 75-300 k tons U3O8.  With a range in grade of 2 to 
4 lbs U3O8, the range of potential mineralization is from 0.2 to 1.1 mm lbs U3O8, and should be 
accessible by open-pit mining.

9.9.3 George-Ver Antelope Target  
 
An exploration area with potential mineralization is called the George-Ver Antelope target which lies 
west and southwest of the main George-Ver deposits and the previously mined Lucky Mc open pits 
(Figures 9-4, 9-5 and 10-10).  No substantial data is available for this target.  However, based on the 
nearby known mineralization and previous fence drilling in the area (Figure 9-4) an exploration target 
potential is estimated. 
 
With an overall trend length of 6,800 feet, width of 150 feet and thickness of 12 feet, the potential 
tonnage associated with the Antelope target is about 0.85 million tons; a low-end estimate.  A high-end 
estimate is obtained by using a trend length of 13,000 feet, width of 200 feet and thickness of 12 feet, for 
an estimated tonnage of  2.00 mm tons (16 cubic feet per ton).  The range in grade of potential 
mineralization is 1.4 to 1.8 lbs U3O8 per ton.  Thus the range of potential mineralization is between 1.1 
and 3.5 mm lbs U3O8, and should be accessible by open pit mining or in-situ methods. 
 
9.9.4 Loco-Lee Target  
 
At Loco-Lee, Strathmore completed necessary core assaying and PFN/gamma logging across the area 
covered by the historical FAP database purchased from Cameco in 2010, providing CAM the confidence 
to generate a compliant inferred resource (see Section 14).  However, since Strathmore only acquired 
approximately half of the historical drilling completed on the property by FAP, only a portion of the 
Loco-Lee was given a mineral resource.  The remainder of the property has potential for additional 
mineralization that with additional test drilling may be elevated to a compliant resource.  The areas of 
potential mineralization are shown on Figure 9-8, and consist of the area east of the FAP designed pit 
where historical drilling occurred but the gamma logs are unavailable, and to the north between the dense 
drilling and an area further north previously explored and partially mined by Pathfinder Mines in the 
1970s called the north and south Rex pits.   
 
For the northern exploration target, an overall trend length of 2,400 feet, width of 400 feet and thickness 
of 10 feet, the potential tonnage associated with this target is about 0.6 mm tons.  Using a range in grade 
of potential mineralization of 1.4 to 3.0 lbs U3O8 per ton, the range of potential mineralization is between 
0.8 and 1.8 mm lbs U3O8, and should be readily accessible by open-pit mining

9.9.5 Tablestakes Target 
 
Strathmore's 2012 drilling in the Tablestakes area covered part of the historic Amazon resource and area 
of close-spaced drilling by Federal American Partners (ANC, 1985) and extended east beyond the former 
Amazon claim group.  The potential target (Figure 9-5), within this untested area to the east, is 1,000 feet 
in length, 300 to 600 feet wide, and 10 to 15 feet thick, with estimated grade of 0.08 to 0.15 % U3O8 
yielding a range of potential mineralization from 0.3 to 1.7 million pounds of U3O8.  Cam believes a 
reasonable estimate of range of possible mineralization at the Tablestakes mineral target is from 0.3 to 1.7 
million pounds of U3O8.   
 
9.9.6 Jeep South Target 
 
This target lies immediately south, and on-trend from the Jeep deposit (Figure 9-5).  It is a north-south 
elongate area about 1.8 miles long and about 0.7 miles wide; mineralization in the defined Jeep deposit 
appears open and may extend into this north-south area.  Maximum possible trend length is estimated at 
9,500 feet; a more conservative estimate of trend length is 4,500 feet.  The width of mineralization is 
estimated at 150 to 200 feet, which is the average width of the Jeep rolls from Strathmore's and ANC's 
drill data.  A mineralized thickness of 5.6 feet is based on average thickness of rolls in the Jeep deposit.  
The range of average grade is 0.05 to 0.08 % eU3O8 based upon the historical results of ANC's drill data. 
 
A conservative trend length of 4,500 feet, width of 150 feet and thickness of 5.6 feet would give an 
estimated 0.2 million pounds of U3O8.  An upper estimate of potential mineral body size is based upon a 
length of 9,500 feet, a width of 200 feet, and thickness of 5.6 feet, providing a body of about 670,000 
tons, with a grade of 0.08 % or 1.5 lbs U3O8 per ton containing an estimated 1.1 million pounds.  
 
CAM believes a reasonable estimate of range of possible mineralization at the Jeep South Extension 
mineral target is from 0.2 to 1.1 million pounds of U3O8. 
 
9.9.7 Summary of Potential Targets in the Main Gas Hills District (North of Beaver Rim) 
 
The historical estimates made by various parties prior to 1990 are discussed in Section 6 of this report. 
 
The potential mineral estimates by CAM presented below are pursuant to NI 43-101 Standards for 
Disclosure for Mineral Project guidelines, Section 2.3 (2), which states that "subject to the provisions 
thereof, an issuer may disclose the potential quantity and grade, expressed as ranges, of a target of further 
exploration".  The potential quantities and grades are conceptual in nature and do not meet the NI 
43-101 classifications of "measured", "indicated" or "inferred" mineral resources.  There has been 
insufficient exploration to define NI 43-101-compliant mineral resources in the areas of proposed 



 

 

CAM 127117 71

mineral targets and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the targets being delineated 
as mineral resources. 
 
Table 9-1 below summarizes CAM's estimate of exploration potential for the six mineral targets 
discussed above that are being considered for future exploration drilling by Strathmore in the main Gas 
Hills district.  The grades used to estimate U3O8 content of the targets are conservative but are consistent 
with average grades of nearby areas of drilled mineralization and also is consistent with exploration 
drilling results from Strathmore's exploration activities and historical data.

9.10 Beaver Rim Exploration Areas 
 
Additional exploration targets lie south of the Beaver Rim divide as shown in Figure 9-1.  These areas 
have favorable geology for discovery of uranium mineralization, but have been relatively little explored, 
and include the West Diamond, East Diamond, South Black Mountain and North Black Mountain mineral 
targets.  Regional geologic studies (Armstrong, 1970) strongly suggest that the favorable arkose member, 
favorable host for uranium mineralization, underlies most of these areas.  Further, Armstrong (1970) also 
recognized that the uranium roll deposits of the Gas Hills are all part of a large roll-front system, and 
located along a sinuous trend that snakes up through the Gas Hills.  Bleached or oxidized arkose is 
located south of the mineral trend and reduced or unbleached host rocks lie to the north.  A reasonable 
probability exists that the trend of roll-front mineralization passes through the mineral targets cited above 
and located on Strathmore property.  King (1982) compiled information that suggests potential 
mineralization in the arkose host rocks lies at depth of 550 to 1200 feet below the surface. 
 
The West Diamond and East Diamond targets cover several square miles, south of the central part of the 
Gas Hills district (Figure 9-1 and 9-9), and south of the Beaver Rim divide.  Regional compilation of 



 

 

CAM 127117 72 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

uranium mineralization data (Armstrong, 1970) suggests that the oxidation-reduction boundary of roll-
front should be present on these targets and thus, they are valid targets for additional exploration drilling. 
 
Compilation of exploration drilling done by American Nuclear and other previous owners indicates that 
significant exploration drilling was done in these targets (1977 Mining Intelligence Map.)  About 112 
historic exploration holes were drilled in the West Diamond target and about 176 historic holes were 
drilled in the East Diamond Target (Figure 9-9.)  The holes were drilled along east-west and north-south 
lines.  Lines were about 1500 feet apart and holes were drilled 200 to 400 feet apart along the lines.  No 
information is available on results of this exploration drilling. 
 
Strathmore carried out a program of exploration drilling on these targets in the summer and autumn of 
2012.  Twelve rotary holes were drilled in the West Diamond target, and three rotary holes were drilled in 
the East Diamond target area.  Results of this drilling are summarized in Section 10 and drill hole 
locations are shown in Figure 10-24 and 10-25. 
 
The South Black Mountain area lies west of Black Mountain and south of Beaver Rim Divide.  The target 
is comprised of parallel elongate targets separated by an area of around 100 feet (Figure 9-1.)  Each 
elongate target trends northwest-southeast and each is about one mile wide and two to three miles long. 
Armstrong's (1970) geologic compilation suggests that most of these mineral target areas are underlain by 
bleached and oxidized arkose of the Wind River Formation, and thus would be unfavorable for the 
presence of uranium mineralization. A possible exception is the east leg of the mineral target.  Just to the 
northwest onto adjacent property not controlled by Strathmore, Cameco is actively drilling on close 
spaced grid patterns and is believed to be developing a uranium deposit that appears to lie close to the 
property boundary (See red stars on Figure 9-9). 
 
Strathmore's property includes an area south of Cameco's drilling where closely-spaced historical drilling 
occurred: the Allegretti uranium trend (Figure 9-9). The Allegretti claim group was owned by Adobe Oil 
& Gas Corporation in 1976 (Dames & Moore, 1976).  Uranium mineralization in the Wind River 
Formation was located by drilling in six horizons, each containing roll type uranium mineralization.  Two 
separate areas about 5,000 feet apart were explored by this historical drilling, with favorable results 
reported above (see Section 6.1.6 of this report). Twenty exploration holes were drilled in the west area, 
of which 18 encountered evidence of mineralization in four horizons, with grades from 0.07 to 0.116 % 
U3O8.  The depth of mineralization is about 1,200 feet.  The east area was drilled with about 30 
exploration holes and encountered mineralization with grades of 0.102 to 0.27 % eU3O8 at depths of about 
1,200 feet.  
 
Strathmore drilled the South Black Mountain target area in the summer of 2012.  Twenty-four rotary 
holes were drilled.  Drilling conditions were challenging and only 19 holes were completed to target

depth.  No exploration drilling was done at the North Black Mountain target in 2012.  Results of the 
drilling south of the Beaver Rim divide are summarized in Section 10.

10.0 DRILLING 
 
Strathmore's drilling has been successful in better-defining mineralized areas, and in defining NI 43-101 
compliant mineral resources, as discussed in the following sections.  CAM visited Strathmore's active 
drilling sites in the main lower Gas Hills district and in the Beaver Rim area on April 24, 2012, August 7, 
2012, and November 7 â€“ 9, 2012 and verified the drilling procedures described below. 
 
Strathmore's practice is to drill holes using 4Â¾ to 5Â¼-inch diameter bits by conventional rotary drill rigs 
using air, foam or circulating drilling mud.  The cuttings are collected over 5 foot intervals and laid out on 
the ground in rows of 20 samples (100 feet) by the driller.  The site geologist examines cuttings in the 
field to determine rock type and geochemical alteration.  The geologist also determines when the drill 
hole is terminated.  Logging trucks are at the drill site and the holes are logged with a gamma probe and a 
probe containing a gamma detector and a PFN probe. 
 
In May 2011, Strathmore started drilling in the Gas Hills, specifically on the Day Loma, George-Ver, 
Loco-Lee, Bullrush, and Rock Hill properties, using a reverse-circulation (RC) drill rig.  A total of 41 RC 
holes were drilled and logged with gamma and PFN tools during the summer 2011.  RC samples were 
collected for mine and mill permitting requirements.  This method allows bulk samples to be collected 
from surface to total depth (varies from 100-450 feet).  The retrieved mineralized samples are substantial 
in size and can be used for mill amenability and column leach testing to determine the ideal leachant (acid 
versus alkaline) and mill scenario (heap leach versus conventional milling). 
 
Holes drilled for environmental monitoring of water are designated with a number followed by MW and 
are included in the numbering sequence that includes all holes.  All holes, including MW holes were 
logged by gamma probes, and at times, by the PFN probe.  All MW holes are included in Table 10-1. 
   
Late in 2011 and throughout the 2012 drilling campaign Strathmore searched for historic drill holes in the 
principal target areas in the field.  When found, these holes were reamed or re-drilled and logged with 
gamma ray probe and with the PFN tool.  Locations of the holes were established with GPS surveying.  
These recovered historic holes are identified by WO in the respective hole number. 
 
Beginning in May 2012, prior to the effective date of this report, Strathmore has used an outside 
contractor (GAA Wireline Inc.) to log holes, and to verify the Strathmore gamma and PFN readings. 
 
Upon completion of the drilling, holes are logged, from the bottom upward, with a gamma-ray, self-
potential, and resistivity probe using their company-owned logging trucks.  The PFN probe is used in 
select mineralized intervals to determine actual uranium concentrations not affected by disequilibrium as 
are the gamma probes (see Sections 11 and 12 for a discussion concerning disequilibrium). Deviation, or 



 

 

CAM 127117 75

hole drift, is recorded automatically by the gamma probes.  Deviations are typically less than 1-3 
degrees, and as dip of the beds in the Gas Hills is very gentle (2-4 degrees) the mineralized intercepts 
reported in this report represent essentially true thickness.  Overburden/interburden samples are 
characterized as part of the mine permitting requirements. 
 
Strathmore logged each of the holes drilled in 2011 and 2012 using  a standard gamma-ray probe and at 
times the PFN tool; resistivity, self-potential, and drift of the drill hole were also determined.  The PFN 
tool and results of the PFN logging are discussed in Sections 11 and 12.  Strathmore also employs core 
drilling through mineralized units.  The resulting core is sent to accredited commercial labs for uranium 
assay; Intermountain Lab in Sheridan, Wyoming and Hazen Research, Inc. in Golden, Colorado.  Core 
assay results are also discussed in Section 12.  
 
Strathmore's drill results are reported as grade percent â‰¥ 0.010% eU3O8 or PFNU3O8 depending which 
logging probe was used; the standard gamma probe or the PFN (neutron) probe, respectively.  Cross-
sections for each target area as shown in subsequent sections show grades as determined by gamma or 
PFN logs. The red line on each section encloses areas that are believed to have grades greater than 0.01%.  
A comparison of the grade % from the standard gamma tool (% eU3O8) versus those from the PFN (% 
PFNU3O8) is provided in the drill hole summary tables for the respective areas in subsequent sections for 
the 2011 and 2012 drill holes, with a separate column showing the disequilibrium factor, if any.  The 
disequilibrium factor (DEF) is determined by dividing the PFN % results by the gamma % results.  A 
DEF of < 1.0 is in negative equilibrium, and DEF > 1.0 is in positive equilibrium, and a DEF of 1.0 
means the mineralized zone is in equilibrium. 
 
Strathmore's drilling in each area is summarized in Table 10-1.  This table excludes abandoned holes and 
those holes for which uranium results had not been received by CAM as of the effective date of this 
report, November 19, 2012.

10.1 Bullrush Project Area Drilling Summary 
 
Strathmore drilled 60 rotary holes and three core holes in the Bullrush area in 2012 as shown in Figure 
10-1.  All holes were logged with a gamma ray probe and a PFN tool.  Eleven confirmation rotary holes 
and one core hole were drilled in the area of the historic pit designed by Federal American Partners 
(FAP).  Table 10-2 shows a sample of drill hole assays obtained from these holes.  Strathmore drilled 49 
rotary exploration holes and two core holes in the Bullrush West-29 target area (see Section 9.5).  These 
holes were drilled in a grid pattern, with lines spaced 200 feet apart and holes located at intervals of 200 
feet along the lines.  Table 10-3 shows a sample of drill hole assays obtained from the rotary holes.  Cross 
section A-A' (Figure 10-2) is a north-south section through the center of the West-29 target and illustrates 
the distribution of uranium mineralization inferred from the gamma logs.  Cross section B-B' (Figure 10-
3) is a northwest-southeast section through the West-29 target and ending in the FAP pit area.

10.2 Day Loma Project Area Drilling Summary 
 
In October 2010, Strathmore initiated drilling on the Day Loma Property.  Nine holes were drilled; seven 
confirmation holes and two monitor wells.  The seven holes were drilled to confirm mineralization at the 
Property and to extend the southeast trend into untested areas.  The two monitor wells were drilled for 
baseline water quality data collection and analysis as required for mine permit submittal, and were all 
logged for uranium.  Results of this drilling are discussed in the previous NI 43-101 report (Nielsen, Pool 
and Sandefur, 2012.)  
 
Two areas within the Day Loma  area are considered to have potential for commercial uranium 
mineralization.  One area lies immediately east and south of the old open pit mine, called the Day Loma 
Southeast Extension target (see Section 9.2).  Thirty-eight holes were drilled in this area, including one 
core hole in 2012, as shown in Figure 10-4.  The second exploration target area drilled was the Northeast 
target and 25 holes were drilled in this area, including one core hole in 2012, as shown in Figure 10-4.  
Other holes were drilled across the greater property to confirm the minieralization indicated by the 
historical database.  
 
The following Table 10-4 summarizes Strathmore's 2012 Day Loma drilling results in the Northeast 
target area; the holes were logged with the standard gamma probe and with the PFN tool that directly 
measures uranium content.  These drill sites are posted on Figure 10-4.  Figures 10-5, 10-6, and 10-7 
depict Cross Sections A-A', D-D' and E-E' respectively and indicate inferred distribution of uranium 
mineralization through the Northeast target area.

10.3 George-Ver Project Area Drilling Summary 
 
Drilling at the George-Ver property in 2011 and 2012 was concentrated in three areas located north, west, 
and South of the historic Lucky Mc open pit as shown in Figure 10-10.  Twelve rotary holes and seven 
core holes were drilled in the area located north and northwest of the old Lucky Mc open pit.  The holes 
were logged with both gamma probe and PFN tools.  Table 10-6 summarize the drilling data from this 
area and section Bâ€”B' (Figure 10-11) illustrates distribution of mineralization inferred from the drill hole 
data. 
 
Twenty-four rotary holes were drilled west of the old open pit and 17 rotary holes were drilled south of 
the old Lucky Mc open pit as shown in Figure 10-10.  All rotary holes were logged with gamma-ray and 
PFN probes.  Tables 10-7 and 10-8 summarize drill hole data from the west and south areas; cross section 
A-A' illustrates the distribution of uranium mineralization inferred from the drill hole data in the west and 
south areas (Figure 10-12).

10.4 Loco-Lee Project Area Drilling Summary 
 
Sixty-five rotary holes and seven core holes were drilled at Loco-Lee in 2011 and 2012 as shown in 
Figure 10-13.  Thirty-eight rotary holes and six core holes were drilled to confirm mineralization in the 
known area of extensive historic drilling located to the northeast of the old open pits.  These holes were 
drilled on a grid with lines spaced 100 feet apart and holes located 100 feet apart along the lines.  In 
addition, thirteen exploration rotary holes also were drilled in a potential mineral target area north and 
west of the known mineralized area with extensive historic drilling.   
 
Table 10-9 summarizes the drill hole data from the area of grid drilling.  Figure 10-14 shows Cross 
Section A-A', oriented northwest-southeast, and indicates distribution of uranium mineralization inferred 
from the drill hole data.  Cross Section B-B' is an east-west section (Figure 10-14) and shows distribution 
of mineralization inferred from the drill data.  Cross Section C-C' is also oriented northwest-southeast 
(Figure 10-15), also showing distribution of mineralization inferred from the drilling data.

10.5 Rock Hill Project Area Drilling Summary 
 
Strathmore started drilling the Rock Hill Property in April, 2011.  Twelve holes were drilled by reverse-
circulation across the Rock Hill deposit to confirm existing historical drilling, retrieval of samples for 
overburden characterization (mine permit requirement), and for recovery of mineralized samples for mill 
amenability and column leach tests.  The holes are located very close to the claim boundary against 
adjacent land controlled by others as shown in Figure 10-17.  Strathmore probed each of the twelve 2011 
holes, using their standard gamma and PFN logging tools.  Drill results from these 2011 holes are 
discussed in a previous NI 43-101 report (Nielsen, Pool and Sandefur, 2012.) 
 
Strathmore drilled 26 more confirmation rotary holes and four core holes in 2012 at the Rock Hill deposit; 
each of the holes was logged by gamma and PFN probes.  Table 10-10 provides typical drill hole data 
from a sampling of holes drilled in 2011 and 2012; Figure 10-18 is an east-west cross section A-A' 
through the drilled area illustrating distribution of uranium mineralization as inferred from the drill hole 
data. 
 
An additional 8 confirmation rotary holes were drilled to the southwest of the Rock Hill mineralization in 
an area previously mined by Utah International and planned for mining by Union Carbide.  Strathmore 



 

 

CAM 127117 95 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update

does not have any supporting historical data in this area.  The recent drilling confirmed the presence of 
uranium mineralization.  Additional drilling is warranted in this area to determine if a potential mineral 
target exits.  
 
The Red Horse area of uranium mineralization lies immediately north of the old mined out open pit on the 
Rock Hill property (Figure 10-17.)  Strathmore drilled four rotary holes in 2012 to confirm results of 
historical core drilling by Adobe Oil & Gas Company in 1977 to 1981.  The Strathmore holes were 
logged by gamma and PFN probing tools.  CAM believes the resulting data (Table 10-10: holes RHS-25, 
-26) shows evidence that uranium mineralization in the Red Horse area has been seriously compromised 
by disequilibrium as discussed in Section 12 (Data Verification) of this report.  Figure 10-19 is an east-
west cross section B-B' through the Red Horse drilled area illustrating distribution of uranium 
mineralization from the drill hole data.

10.6 Tablestakes Project Area Drilling Summary 
 
The Tablestakes Project Area is located southeast of Strathmore's proposed Gas Hills uranium recovery 
facility.  Part of the target, an area called Amazon by Federal American Partners, has an historical 
resource estimate of 285,000 tons grading 0.06 % eU3O8 for a total of 366,000 pounds of uranium (see 
Section 6-History and Table 6-1.) 
 
Strathmore drilled 13 holes in this Amazon target area in 2012 as shown in Figure 10-20.  Holes are 
widely spaced and drilled on grid lines spaced 400 feet apart, and holes located 400 feet apart on the grid 
lines.  Six additional holes were drilled to the west, in an area of pit highwalls not mined previously by 
Union Carbide and Federal American Partners.  All holes were logged with gamma and PFN logging 
probes.  Table 10-11 lists representative drillhole probe data from these holes.  Sections A-A' (Figure 10-
21), B-B' (Figure 10-22), and C-C' (Figure 10-23) show distribution and potential grade of uranium 
mineralization inferred from logging data.  Note that an intercept of 14.5 feet of 0.079 % PFNU3O8 at a 
depth of 229.5 feet was obtained in drillhole TSS-07.

10.7 Beaver Rim Exploration Area Drilling Summary 
 
Strathmore carried out exploration drilling at several targets south of the Bearver Rim Divide during the 
summer and autumn of 2012.  Location, geologic favorability and previous historic drill testing, which 
justified exploration in the area, is discussed in Section 9.10 of this present report. 
 
Strathmore drilled 12 rotary exploration holes in the West Diamond target as show in Figure 10-24 and 
three rotary exploration holes in the East Diamond area.  Nineteen rotary exploration holes were drilled in 
the South Black Mountain target area as shown in Figure 10-25.  All holes were logged with the gamma 
probe and several with  the PFN tool.  No core holes were drilled south of Beaver Rim. 
 
Table 10-12 shows drill data from some of the mineralized holes in the West Diamond and South Black 
Mountain targets.  Uranium mineralization was encountered in the east part of the West Diamond target.  
Cross sections A-A' (Figure 10-26) and B-B' (Figure 10-27) are an east-west and north-south section 
respectfully though the east part of the target and show distribution of uranium mineralization inferred 
from the logging data.

drill holes and Cross section B-B' (Figure 10-29) is an east-west section through the south part of the 
drilled area.  These sections show distribution of uranium mineralization inferred from the logging data. 
 
Additional drilling is warranted on these three exploration targets to define potential mineral resources.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, SECURITY AND PROTOCOLS 
 
Sedimentary uranium deposits are most efficiently sampled by measuring the quantity of radiation 
emitted along the length of a drill hole and converting those measurements into equivalent grade and 
thickness of uranium mineralization.  Such measurements are typically obtained through the process of 
down-hole logging with various instruments, supplemented by chemical assays. 
 
11.1 Historical Analyses 
 
Much of the historical (pre-NI-43-101) logging in the Gas Hills was done by the mining and exploration 
companies themselves, using their own equipment.  Much of the logging was also carried out by Century 
Geophysical, Scinti-Log, or Geoscience Associates.  All three companies were well-known, well 
respected, and are considered to have operated well within industry standards of the time. 
 
Standard electric logs consisted of recordings of gamma, self-potential, and resistivity.  Self-potential and 
resistivity data are useful in defining bedding boundaries and for correlation of sandstone units and 
mineralized zones between drill holes.  Historically, equivalent U3O8 content was calculated from gamma 
logs using industry-standard methods developed by the Atomic Energy Commission (now the DOE: 
Department of Energy), using either manual or computer methods.  The manual method is as follows. 
 
For zones greater than 2 feet thick, first pick an upper and lower boundary of mineralization by choosing 
points approximately one-half height from background to peak of gamma anomaly.  Then determine 
counts per second (cps) for each half-foot interval between the points, convert cps to GT (grade times 
thickness) using the appropriate dead-time, k-factor and water factor for the specific logging unit utilized, 
and divide GT by thickness to obtain grade - %eU3O8. 
 
Alternatively, the AEC developed a computer-based "gamma log" program which is similar but which 
automated much of the process.  In addition, Century Geophysical developed its own computerized 
interpretation method, the results of which were output in combination with the electric logging results 
upon completion of each logging process. 
 
These gamma log interpretations provided the basic building blocks from which quantities of mineralized 
material could be calculated.  CAM accepts that these interpretations were industry standard at the time 
(1950's through 1970's). 
 
Core holes were drilled to supplement the gamma data, to provide information for determination of 
disequilibrium, and to provide material for metallurgical testing.  Drill core was typically sampled in half-
foot or one-foot intervals and sent to various laboratories for uranium analysis.  These analyses typically 



 

 

CAM 127117 110

22 March 2013 

included: fluorimetric chemical analysis, and closed-can radiometric analysis.  Any major differences 
between the two analyses could be indicative of a disequilibrium situation, in which gamma logs do not 
provide a reasonably accurate analysis of the quantity of uranium present. 
 
Core assays were typically completed by either Chemical and Geological Laboratories of Casper, 
Wyoming or Skyline Laboratories of Wheat Ridge, Colorado.  Both laboratories were well-known, well 
respected, and are considered to have operated well within the standards of the industry at the time. 
 
11.2 Strathmore Analyses 
 
Since 2007, Strathmore has implemented a program of confirmation drilling utilizing standard gamma 
logging, and since 2011, both Prompt Fission Neutron (PFN) and gamma logging.  This program serves 
as an indirect check on the historical drilling results in that it confirms the presence of uranium 
mineralization as well as the general character of the mineralization.  In 2012, Strathmore implemented 
core drilling at the Bullrush, George-Ver, Loco-Lee and Rock Hill properties for chemical assay 
determinations to compare the results to the gamma and PFN logging.   
 
The Strathmore PFN and gamma probes from which this data is derived have been frequently calibrated 
at the Casper and Grand Junction DOE test pits and have shown, with a few exceptions, very little drift 
between calibrations as set forth in Table 11-1 through Table 11-5.

11.3 Security 
 
The historical sampling, logging, and gamma-probing were subject to the normal industrial security 
controls typical of the 1950's to 1970's.  Strathmore's recent security practices involved: awareness of 
chain-of-custody issues, limited access to logging tools through locked storage as approved by USNRC, 
and continuing calibration of logging tools to assure that no tampering has occurred.  All drill hole 
physical samples are in locked storage until sent out for laboratory testing. 
 
Beginning in May 2012, Strathmore has utilized third-party independent PFN and gamma logging 
provided by GAA Wireline Inc of Casper, Wyoming.  GAA operated their own logging equipment and at 
times, provided loggers who operated Strathmore's company-owned PFN logging truck.  GAA provided 
calibration documentation of test pit runs, which were also reviewed by CAM.  
 
11.4 Summary 
 
CAM is satisfied that those uranium analyses used for resources estimation (as described in Sections 12 
and 14) are adequate for the estimation of compliant indicated and inferred mineral resources. 
 
Strathmore is taking steps to improve the pedigree of data for the remaining areas.  These steps include 
further confirmation drilling, a continuing program of independent contractor logging of some holes, and 
core drilling for chemical assays. 
 
  



 

 

CAM 127117 113 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION  
 
Validation of the drill hole database is a key element in preparation of this NI 43-101 report.  The drill 
hole database for Strathmore's Gas Hills project consists of thousands of historical drill holes with 
gamma logs, mostly from the 1970s, but also with some from as early as the 1950s.  It is recognized that 
gamma logs are indirect measurements of the amount of uranium present and that these indirect 
measurements must be validated.  Typically, this validation process consists of comparing equivalent 
uranium determined from gamma log interpretations with chemical analyses of rock core recovered from 
core holes.  Even this process is subject to some degree of uncertainty because the gamma logs and the 
chemical assays are obtained from different samples: core from the drill hole itself and gamma readings 
from the material surrounding the hole.  However, this process has served the industry well for over 50 
years and is still widely used today. 
 
Technology has advanced since the 1970s and another form of drill hole analysis is available today: 
Prompt Fission Neutron (PFN).  PFN analysis assesses the quantity of uranium present surrounding a drill 
hole directly by measuring neutrons fissioned from the 235U isotope.  It is still necessary to validate the 
results by comparison to core hole chemical assay data, but perhaps not to the degree necessary for 
gamma logs.  Indeed, it is anticipated that, through regular ongoing use of PFN with its associated 
calibration checks and continuing checks against existing or historical core holes, a background of 
validity can be achieved which will reduce the number and frequency of future checks. 
 
Strathmore's historical gamma log database consists mainly of Century, Scinti-Log and Geoscience 
gamma logs.  Each of these companies was quite active and respected for its technology during the 1970s 
uranium boom.  Systematic bias is unlikely, but in specific situations, operators and equipment can cause 
discrepancies that must be identified and rectified. 
 
The principal cause of discrepancies in gamma logging is "disequilibrium". 
 
CIM Best Practice for Uranium sets forth the following discussion on disequilibrium. 
 
"Disequilibrium: An imbalance between the uranium content and the radioactivity emitted by a given 
volume of mineralized rock. This imbalance is caused by either differential mobilization of the more 
soluble uranium from the deposition site, relative to its daughter isotopes, or by a lack of time for the 
accumulation of the daughter isotopes to reach a state of equilibrium after the uranium has been 
deposited.  Generally when the decay series is in equilibrium the gamma plus beta radiation is 
proportional to the amount of uranium present. 
 



 

 

CAM 127117 114 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

Disequilibrium is particularly prevalent in sandstone-hosted uranium deposits within a dynamic 
hydrologic regime, where mobilization of the uranium out of the deposition site results in an 
overestimation of the uranium content, based on radiometric measurements.  Conversely, in a 
geologically young environment, a deficiency of daughters relative to uranium will cause an 
underestimation of uranium content based on radiometric methods.  The degree of Disequilibrium may 
vary from place to place within a deposit.  Equivalent Assay: Determination of uranium content by 
radiometric methods.  The validity of Equivalent Assays must be demonstrated with chemical assay 
determinations.  Where employed, equivalent uranium determinations should be reported and 
appropriately illustrated in the database (e.g. eU3O8)." 
 
Information by which a gamma-log database might be validated is available in three forms: 

1. Verification of gamma log interpretations; 
2. Comparison of historical gamma log and chemical assay data for core holes, and  
3. Comparison of recent PFN and gamma log data from a confirmation drilling program. 

 
12.1 Gamma log Interpretation and General Validation 
 
Gamma log interpretations comprise the vast majority of data which might be used to calculate resources 
for Strathmore's Gas Hills properties.  It is necessary to validate this data in both general and specific 
ways in order to provide a reasonable basis for resource calculation.  Property specific validation is 
addressed by individual property in succeeding sections of this report.  General validation consists of 
broader assessments including: accuracy of gamma log interpretations, cross checks on both gamma and 
PFN logging, quality control of chemical assays, and validity of PFN as a partial replacement for core 
drilling and chemical assays. 
 
As set forth in CAM's NI 43-101 report of Strathmore's Gas Hill properties dated 22 March 2013, CAM 
reviewed gamma log interpretations provided for the various Strathmore properties and concluded that 
those interpretations are reasonable and appropriate. 
 
12.1.1 Logging Cross-Checks 
 
Additional confidence in logging and interpretation is possible when results are available from different 
sources.  Strathmore contracted with GAA Wireline Inc (Casper, Wyoming), an independent contractor, 
to provide a series of logging cross-checks for both gamma and PFN.  These cross-checks are 
summarized in Table 12-1 and Table 12-2. 
 
As can be readily seen in Tables 12-1 and 12-2, Strathmore and GAA logging results are quite 
comparable in both cases, with total GxT for gamma and PFN differing by only 7% and 6%, respectively.  



 

 

CAM 127117 115 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

This is a positive indication of appropriate logging procedures by Strathmore and the validity of the 
results.  Strathmore also provided cross-checks of gamma readings between old and new logging trucks, 
and cross checks between Strathmore and GAA trucks using GAA operators.  The net result is that 
recent/current logging results form a reliable basis for resource calculation.

12.1.2 Validity of PFN Logging 
 
PFN logging is a relatively new development in the assessment of sub-surface uranium concentrations.  
Its primary purpose is to reduce or eliminate the costly and time-consuming process of core drilling and 
chemical assays in uranium-bearing formations where disequilibrium is present.  As such, it is necessary 
to build up some degree of confidence in PFN results.  This can be accomplished by comparing PFN 



 

 

CAM 127117 116 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

results with chemical assay results for a series of core holes.  As confidence in PFN results increases, the 
number of core holes can be reduced. 
 
It must be recognized that PFN and chemical data represent significantly different and separate sample 
volumes: a sphere some 3-feet in diameter for PFN; and a 2 & 3/4-inch cylinder for core.  Of course, the 
removed core is not a part of the PFN sample volume.  In addition, core loss may or may not be 
recognized over relatively short intervals. 
 
The following table sets forth a series of data collected by Strathmore in 2012 comparing PFN and 
chemical results for 17 core holes with 23 individual zones.

Table 12-3 shows an overall bias in GxT of about 20% toward the chemical.  It is notable, however, that 
the RHS series accounts for the majority of this difference and that, as shown subsequently, in the Rock

correlation. 
 
On an overall basis, PFN data compares reasonably well with chemical data and is certainly a more 
reliable indicator of uranium mineralization than gamma logging.  CAM accepts PFN as a reasonable 
substitute for more costly core hole drilling and chemical assaying, but cautions that an ongoing, albeit 
reduced, program of core hole drilling and chemical assaying is still required under CIM "Best Practice 
for Uranium" guidelines in order to build up complete confidence in the PFN process.

12.1.3 Chemical Assay - Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
 
Historically, chemical assays of drill hole core have been the "gold standard" by which uranium 
mineralization has been assessed.  Drawbacks include: small sample size, lost core and potential 
laboratory error.  While little can be done to mitigate the first two items, laboratory error can be detected 
and minimized by both internal checks such as standards, blanks and replicate analyses, and external 
checks by another independent laboratory.  Both types of checks are available for recent Strathmore core 
drilling. 
 
A series of 37 laboratory cross-checks between Hazen and IML are available for Strathmore core as 
illustrated in Figure 12-2.  The least squares regression correlation coefficient (R2) for this set of data is 
96%, indicative of a very good correspondence.  This correspondence provides a high degree of 
confidence in the chemical assay data base. 
 
Additional assurance is provided by internal QA/QC examples of which are set forth as follows:

Both internal and external checks on chemical assays are well within industry standards and CAM accepts 
this program and its results as providing reasonable assurance of chemical assay accuracy. 
 
12.1.4 Gamma log Interpretation and General Validation Conclusions 
 
Strathmore has entered into a significant program of data validation for its recent drilling efforts.  All of 
this data is well correlated and the cross-check process is designed to detect any meaningful bias.  As 
such, this program provides a high level of assurance of the accuracy of data generated by those efforts.  
In turn, this new data provides a strong foundation from which to judge, assess, and evaluate historical 
data for property specific purposes.

A regression analysis of the respective PFN and gamma GxT data for the recent Bullrush drill holes 
indicates a correlation coefficient (R2) of 90%, a good correlation.   
 
Based on the above analyses, CAM believes that historical gamma data is likely to understate the quantity 
of mineralization present in the Bullrush Project Area, and that an upward adjustment is appropriate.  
Given an overall PFN:gamma ratio of about 1.5, and minimum 95% confidence interval for the mean of 
about 1.5, CAM believes that it is appropriate to adjust historical gamma grades upward by 50% in order 
to calculate an in-place resource.  This is a rather large adjustment which is based on a relatively small 
data set (32 holes) and the potential inaccuracies inherent in this process dictate that the resource so 
calculated should be classed as "Inferred".  Whenever available, PFN and chemical assay drillhole data 
should be used in the resource calculation. 
 
12.3 Day Loma Project Area â€“Data Verification 
 
Drill holes at the Day Loma property with both PFN and gamma data now number 39.  The following 
table sets forth comparative grade-thickness data for each of those drill holes.  This data is based on a 
grade cut-off of 0.025% U3O8 and eU3O8. Descriptive statistics for the ratio of PFN vs Gamma are set 
forth in the following table.

12.3.1 Day Loma Historical Chemical Assay Data 
 
The following table (Table 12-9) and charts summarize the direct comparison of historical gamma log and 
chemical data for three core holes in the Day Loma deposit.  The gamma log data was obtained by current 
CAM interpretation of the historical gamma logs.  Chemical assay data for the Day Loma core holes was 
prepared by Chemical and Geological Laboratories of Casper Wyoming.  This laboratory was utilized by 
most uranium industry participants in the 1970s and maintained a strong reputation for reliability.  The 
laboratory notes on its Analytical Reports that: "data was obtained from routine analysis in which each 
sample was tested once for U3O8 concentration.  The anticipated average deviation for a given series of 
at least 20 samples is +- 10% of the value reportedâ€¦â€¦"

While there are some substantial differences in individual grade and thickness, the GxT products compare 
reasonably well and the total GxT values differ only by 11% in favor of chemical results.  Thus, the total 
pounds U3O8 indicated by each set would be quite close and those by gamma log, slightly conservative. 
 
The following charts illustrate the correlation of chemical and gamma log data used in this review. 
 

 
  

 
 
Each of the three charts provides a good example of reasonable correlation between chemical assays and 
gamma logs.  This correlation indicates that the Strathmore gamma log database should provide a useful 
basis for the estimation of uranium resources at the Day Loma deposit. 
 
Based on the above analyses, CAM believes that historical gamma data is likely to provide a reasonable 
indication of the quantity of mineralization present and that no adjustment is warranted.  Calculation of an 
in-place resource can proceed on the basis of the original gamma data as supplemented by more recent 
PFN and chemical data.  Relatively good correlations between PFN, chemical assays and gamma provide 
a reasonable basis for calculation of an "Indicated" resource provided that the drill hole spacing is also 
adequate for such a classification.

A regression analysis of the respective PFN and gamma GxT data for the recent Loco Lee drill holes 
indicates a correlation coefficient (R2) of 20%, a very poor correlation.   
 
Based on the above analyses, CAM believes that historical gamma data is likely to provide only a broad 
indication of the quantity of mineralization present.  Given a very poor correlation, an overall 
PFN:gamma ratio of about 0.8 and minimum 95% confidence interval for the mean of about 0.9, CAM 
believes that it is appropriate to adjust historical gamma grades downward by 15% in order calculate an 
in-place resource for the Loco-Lee Project Area.  Inaccuracies inherent in this process dictate that the 
resource so calculated should be classed as no better than "Inferred".  Whenever available, PFN and 
chemical drillhole data should be used in the resource calculation.

Table 12-6 of the previous Gas Hills NI43-101 report sets forth a series of historical chemical assay and

accuracy of gamma log data. 
 
The ratios of chemical versus gamma log for that data set show a 95% confidence interval for the mean 
ratio of chemical to gamma of 2.1 to 1.3, or plus/minus about 30%.  The correlation coefficient (R2) is 
85% and overall ratio of chemical assay to gamma log is 1.35.  These parameters seem to indicate a 
reasonable correlation between chemical assay and gamma log data.  A scatter diagram of this data shows 
discernible trend in Figure 12-8, but note that the scales are logarithmic and, thus, the dispersion of values 
is significant.

In summary, for the Rock Hill deposit at the lower 95% confidence interval: PFN GxT exceeds 
gammalog GxT by a factor of 1.2; chemical GxT values exceed gammalog GxT values by a factor of 1.3; 
and chemical assay grade exceeds closed can grade by a factor of 1.7.  Given the rather wide spread of 
available information, CAM believes that it is appropriate to adjust historical gamma grades upward by 
20% in order calculate an in-place resource for the Rock Hill Project Area.  Inaccuracies inherent in this 
process dictate that the resource so calculated should be classed as no better than "Inferred".  Whenever 
available, PFN and chemical drill hole data should be used in the resource calculation. 
 
 
Historical chemical assay data for the Rock Hill property (the Red Horse deposit north of the open pit) 
recently became available to Strathmore.  This data as set forth in Table 12-16 shows a very different 
picture of chemical versus gamma log relationship to the main Rock Hill deposit with a compliant mineral 
resource.

In summary, the historical data is conflicting and is also in conflict with recent data.  These conflicts 
suggest that at least portions of the Rock Hill property are in rather severe disequilibrium and that 
available gamma log data does not provide a sound foundation for calculating a resource.  It may be 
possible to calculate some type of resource using only PFN and chemical data provided that drill hole 
spacing is adequate.  For the main Rock Hill deposit, inaccuracies inherent in this process dictate that the 
resource so calculated should be classed as no better than "Inferred".  Whenever available, PFN and 
chemical drillhole data should be used in the resource calculation. 
 
12.7 Tablestakes, Jeep, and Beaver Rim Areas â€“ Data Verification 
 
At the time of this report writing there is only limited PFN data and no chemical data available for the 
Tablestakes and Jeep Project Areas, and the Beaver Rim Exploration Target Areas.  Strathmore has 
performed PFN logging on 8 drill holes in the Tablestakes Project Area, and on 3 drill holes in the South 
Black Mountain Exploration Target Area on Beaver Rim.  As such, data verification analysis was not 
performed for these areas.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
Strathmore is evaluating the Gas Hills Uranium project for conventional open pit mining near the former 
open-pit mines in the lower Gas Hills, and for underground and/or in-situ recovery from potential targets 
in the Beaver Rim area (South Gas Hills).  In May 2011, Strathmore commissioned Lyntek Inc. of 
Lakewood, Colorado, an experienced firm in uranium engineering and processing research, to carry out 
preliminary metallurgical studies and investigate Strathmore's proposed Gas Hills uranium heap leach 
recovery plans. 
 
Strathmore collected bulk composited samples from 41 reverse circulation drill holes from the 2010-2011 
drilling.  The holes chosen for compositing were from the Bullrush, Day Loma, George-Ver, Loco-Lee, 
and Rock Hill project areas.  Eight composites were prepared and were analyzed for uranium content at 
InterMountain Labs of Sheridan, Wyoming, an independent state-accredited laboratory with US NRC 
certification.  
 
The samples were then submitted to Lyntek and eight bottle roll tests were done on the composited 
samples from the above named properties.  Lyntek provided preliminary results of the tests on January 25, 
2012.  Average grade of all eight samples is 0.113% uranium (U).  Average recovery is 89.2% U.  The 
analytical methods for determining the uranium in the leach residue were determined to be inadequate due 
to improper digestion techniques, such that the actual uranium content in the head samples could have 
been reported as lower than actual values, which would have artificially increased the uranium recovery 
estimates, so much so, that several of the tests showed a recovery in excess of 100%.  Therefore, the 
recovery calculations are suspect, and can only be considered as indicative.  However, four subsequent 
agitation leach tests, performed on January 9, 2013 by Litz & Associates, of Golden Colorado, achieved 
recoveries of 82%-94%.  
 
Reagent consumption varied widely, particularly acid consumption from a high of 230 lbs./ton H2SO4  
from one George-Ver sample to 30 lbs/ton H2SO4  on samples from other deposits.  These preliminary 
tests indicate that U is recoverable by leaching.  Lyntek considers the overall reagent consumptions are 
low (15-30 lbs./ton) but actual recovery is uncertain, with an average of 55 lbs./ton due to the high acid 
consumption of the single George-Ver sample.  Lyntek is continuing with column leach tests.  
Engineering design and reagent consumption estimates will be based upon pending results of the column 
leach tests. 
 
In addition to the bottle roll test, two bulk composite samples from the several properties were prepared 
for column leach tests.  One sample, a non-plastic silty sand, was considered high grade at 0.114 % U, 
and a second sample, a moderately plastic clayey sand, was considered low grade at 0.017 % U.  Leach 
time for the column tests was about 20 days.  Leach solutions were very much over-acidified (50 gms/l 



 

 

CAM 127117 140 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

for 2 days; 100 gms/l after that) resulting in very low pH, high SO4 effluent.  Tests to determine relative 
ion exchange characteristics compared to solvent extraction characteristics to remove U from the effluent 
solutions were not conclusive, since these tests were performed at unrealistically high acid consumption, 
which would preclude proper evaluation of beneficiation methods. 
 
Strathmore has completed work in its Summer 2012 Column Leach Test, which consisted of a 20 foot 
column, 8 inches in diameter, filled with approximately 560 lbs of mineralized material from the Bullrush 
project area.  This material had a grade of 0.137% U.  Initital test data show a recovery of 91.12%.  A 
comprehensive report prepared by Lyntek Inc. is forthcoming.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
Resource estimation usually involves the steps of data validation, compositing, statistical and 
geostatistical analysis, assignment of grades to all points within the area of interest, resource classification 
and resource tabulation. 
 
CAM selectively used data generated by previous operators on the basis of CAM's review of the data and 
comparison to the data provided by Strathmore and accepted by CAM, to support statements and opinions 
presented in this Technical Report. 
 
CAM's analysis of the previous data is discussed at considerable length in Sections 6, 10, 11, 12, and 14 
of this report.  The data used by CAM was developed by reputable mining companies using practices 
current at the time; however, in some cases there is not a sufficient audit trail for all of these data to 
justify classification to a higher level than inferred mineral resources. 
 
Key assumptions in the resource estimate are as follows: 

1. CAM reviewed gamma ray, PFN, closed can and chemical assay data for all five properties.  
For Day Loma and George-Ver CAM found that PFN, closed can and chemical assay data 
supported the assumption that the gamma ray eU3O8 could be used for calculation of indicated 
and inferred resources.  For Bullrush, Rock Hill and Loco Lee the data are suitable for 
estimation of an inferred resource but believes that additional chemical, closed can and 
associated PFN and gamma ray data are required for the estimation of indicated and measured 
resources. 

2. CAM reviewed the geometry in three dimensions of mineral intercepts above the grade of 0.035 
and a minimum thickness of 1 foot.  A content of 0.035% eU3O8 corresponds to a contained 
uranium value of $35 per ton at a $50 uranium price.  A foot is about the minimum thickness 
that can be selectively mined by open pit methods.  This review indicated that likely open pit 
minable mineralization is confined by elevations or depths.  These elevations or depths were 
used to define limits for a potentially open pit minable resource. 

3. Day Loma and George-Ver were historically mined by open pits and by underground workings.  
The areas of historic mining were excluded from resource tabulation based on the plan footprint 
of historic mining.  Depending on backslope and vertical extent of underground workings, this 
may be conservative. 

4. Grade thickness and thickness contour maps were constructed using all the data and a zero 
nugget linear variogram.  This gives a smooth contour map which honors the data.  The contour 
maps were consistent with usual roll front deposit geometry but all contour maps showed the 
connectivity associated with potentially minable mineral deposits. 



 

 

CAM 127117 142 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

5. Limits of mineralization in plan for each of the 5 areas were provided by Strathmore.  CAM 
reviewed these and found them to be reasonable so resource reporting was additionally 
constrained to within these areas. 

6. Based on a the variogram ranges of a minimum about 200 feet and review of grade thickness 
contour maps CAM classified resources as inferred if values were interpolated up to 400 ft and 
extrapolated to 200 feet and were not indicated.  Resources were classified as indicated if values 
were interpolated up to 282 ft and extrapolated to 141 ft.  Note that indicated must also have an 
acceptable equilibrium factor. 

7. A specific volume of 16.9 cubic feet per ton is suitable for the estimation of tonnage and 
contained pounds.  This is based on current measurements.  Although additional specific 
volume information should be obtained, CAM believes this value is suitable for estimation of an 
inferred and indicated resource. 

 
14.1 Determination of Uranium Content 
 
Resource estimation in "roll front" uranium is additionally complicated by the fact that actual chemical 
assay data is usually not available for most of the drill holes.  Instead, the amount of parent uranium in the 
ground is indirectly calculated from the gamma-ray intensity from the daughter products of radioactive 
decay of uranium.  Because of the geochemical mobility of uranium, the radioactive daughter elements 
which register in the gamma-ray count may not accurately reflect the amount of uranium actually present; 
therefore, analyses comparing actual (chemically-determined) uranium content to gamma-ray data are 
required.  The ratio of uranium actually present to that calculated from the gamma-ray count is a measure 
of the radiogenic equilibrium of the system.  At equilibrium, the chemically-analyzed uranium matches 
that observed in gamma-ray count.

It will be noted that there are no downhole surveys in the historic database and new drilling was assumed 
vertical as confirmed by actual downhole surveys.  This reflects the historic practice of drilling vertically 
with few if any downhole surveys.  Current Strathmore drilling followed the historic practice of drilling 
vertically but holes were downhole surveyed. 
 
14.3 Geometry of Models 
 
The extent of each grid model was approximately 400 feet beyond any drill holes used in the estimate.  
Geometric parameters of the 3-d models used are given in Tables 14-6 thru 14-10.

14.4 Data Review 
 
Based on past experience with roll fronts, CAM investigated the connectivity of the mineralized stringers 
by constructing five three-dimensional models on 5 foot benches using 5 foot bench composites based on 
the presence of intercepts thicker than 1 foot and greater than 0.035 %eU3O8 assuming the stringers are 
horizontal.  (Stringers do have slightly different and variable dips of course, but most are approximately 
horizontal.)  These five models were visually reviewed on-screen by row and column and this confirmed 



 

 

CAM 127117 145 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

the hypothesis that mineralization occurred in more or less flat lying and more importantly connected 
stringers. 
 
This methodology is unchanged from the prior 43-101 where it is discussed on greater detail.  
 
14.5 Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistics and Geostatistics 
 
CAM reviewed the three-dimensional characteristics of the data as well is a cumulative frequency plots of 
top of ore and depth.  In some cases intercepts which did not fit three dimensionally or statistically with 
the general trend of the data were excluded from the resource estimate.  Specific elevation or depth 
exclusions are detailed below the individual figures. 
 
CAM reviewed statistics and geostatistics of total grade thickness and total thickness by hole for each of 
the five areas using cumulative frequency plots and omnidirectional 2-D variograms derived from logs. 
Cummulative frequency plots and omnidirectional 2-D variograms for total grade thickness are shown in 
Figures 14-1 through 14-10. 
 
The cumulative frequency plots usually showed a classic lognormal distribution with a low-end tail 
corresponding to zero grade holes. There were sometimes slight outliers at the high-end but these were in 
general below the trend of the cumulative frequency line and since holes near the nose of the roll tend to 
be higher grade thickness capping was not applied. 
 
The variograms were in general typical of roll front uranium and were automatically fitted using the 
variance of all the data which resulted in some cases with variograms not entirely visually consistent with 
the data. In almost all cases the range of the variograms was about 200 feet.

14.6 Resource Estimation 
 
14.6.1 Grade Thickness Contours 
 
Using grade thickness contours to calculate resources is accepted engineering practice for roll front 
uranium deposits (e.g. NI 43-101 resource report on Sheep Mountain for Titan Uranium, March 2011).  If 
a contouring algorithm which honors the data is used, the results in terms of totals are often not dissimilar 
to the widely-used Nearest-Neighbor method.  However, there is no single contouring package which 
seems to be preferred in uranium.  CAM examined several different contouring algorithms available in 
the public domain and commercially.  CAM finally settled on estimation using all the data with a zero 
nugget linear variogram.  The underlying mathematics of this estimation technique is the same as kriging 
but the zero nugget linear variogram assures that the input data is honored.  This is a linear estimator and 
may be mathematically shown to give exactly the same total resource as if the roll fronts were split into 
individual rolls or by flitches or benches and estimated using the same contouring algorithm for each unit.  
This statement, while mathematically correct, requires careful attention to how individual intercepts are 
split between individual rolls or by flinches or benches and how cutoffs are applied. 
 
Although grade-thickness and thickness maps are very useful as an aid in visualizing the plan geometry of 
the roll fronts, a smooth contour map which honors the data may present the following issues: 



 

 

CAM 127117 149 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

1. It is possible to have values on the contour map that are greater than the maximum or less than 
the minimum. Typically values greater than the maximum are not unreasonable but however in 
some cases values on the contour map will be less than zero. 

2. If one vertically combines contour maps for several different zones the resulting map may not 
be the same as if one vertically combined the data and then re-contoured the totals. This is not a 
problem with linear estimators such as contouring all the data with a zero nugget linear 
variogram (used for the resource estimate), inverse distance and nearest neighbor. 

3. The behavior of values in front of the nose of the roll is significantly different than values 
behind the nose. 

4. A smooth contour map that honors the data is inconsistent with the geostatistics of roll front 
uranium which normally has a fairly high nugget.  Part of this problem is a hit-or-miss nature 
when drilling near the nose of the roll.  This inconsistency is also due to the fact that roll front 
uranium data is not covariance stationary (a fundamental geostatistical assumption: i.e. one 
averages things separated by a distance in certain directions and then assume these averages 
apply to everything in the dataset.)  This was also alluded to in item 3. 

5. Manual contouring is very time-consuming with the amount of data associated with roll front 
uranium deposits and has a risk of bias. 

 
Additional details and explanation of the resource estimation methodology for Day Loma and Rock Hill 
is given in the prior report which is incorporated by reference.  Contour maps of TGT for the 5 areas 
along with comments are given in the next 5 sections.

Grade thickness contours for inferred resources at Bullrush are shown in Figure 14-11.  It appears that 
additional drilling should be done around the periphery of the interpreted mineralized zone.  Depending 
on the results of this drilling, the mineralized zone should be revised.

Grade thickness contours for indicated and inferred resources at Day Loma are shown in Figure 14-12. It 
appears that additional drilling in the east central area might increase the amount of indicated and inferred 
material.  Additional drilling is needed along the Southwest edge of the apparent roll front to more 
precisely define its location.

Grade thickness contours for indicated and inferred resources at George-Ver are shown in Figure 14-13.  
Note that there are three separate areas of inferred resources.  Before the 200 foot extrapolation constraint 
was applied to this contour map the map showed connectivity of mineralized material.  Additional drilling 
here may potentially increase the size of the mineral resource, and connect these three areas.

Grade thickness contours for inferred material at Loco-Lee are shown in Figure 14-14.  As with George-
Ver there are four areas of not connected mineralization which were connected before the 200 foot 
extrapolation constraint on inferred was applied.  It appears that additional drilling in this area may have 
the potential of increasing the amount ofinferred material.

Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update

CAM believes that additional drilling, carried out in line with current CIM standards, can result in the 
conversion of most of the above inferred resources to measured and/or indicated. 
 
CAM is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, and legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 
marketing, political, or other relevant factors by which the mineral resource estimates could be materially 
affected, other than the usual and well-known uncertainties of uranium price, input costs, and permitting 
delays. 
 
14.8 Potential Based on Historical Data 
 
Section 6 (History) of this Technical Report catalogs the tonnage and grade estimates made by previous 
operators.  CAM believes that additional exploration work in the discussed areas could potentially result 
in the discovery of mineralization which could eventually become classed as mineral resources.  It should 
be noted that the estimates of exploration potential in Section 9 of this report are additional to the 
historical estimates, and additional to the compliant disclosures herein of mineral resources. 
 
14.9 Recommendations 
 
Many of these recommendations involve items which CAM believes are required to bring historical data 
up to current NI 43-101 standards, including required documentation and chain of custody of the data.  
Although almost all the data was obtained from reputable mining companies and was apparently compiled 
according to accepted engineering practice at the time, current verification of this data is not possible.  
For example, the minimum for a drill hole to satisfy current practice there would have to be a traceable 
record of the collar location, downhole probing procedure, the gamma log from the probe (with data on 
probe calibration), and the factors used to calculate uranium from the area under the gamma log. 
 
Strathmore has the original or copies of nearly every log in the Day Loma and Rock Hill areas.  Nearly 
every log has the required k-factors, deadtimes, and calibration information required to reproduce any 
historical calculations.  High quality historical maps show the coordinates of the holes for each of these 
areas.  Both areas also had retrievable core information for equilibrium comments.  The quality of the 
historical information was acceptable to CAM to provide inferred resources for the two areas, in addition 
to indicated resources at Day Loma.  Additionally Strathmore has now drilled in both areas with similar 
results for confirmation. 
 
The George Ver, Bullrush, and Loco Lee areas have less information, sometimes they do not have the 
drill log and the data has been acquired from the historical drill maps.  No historical core information has 
been obtained.  Twin drilling, washing out old holes, PFN logging and coring was completed in all three 



 

 

CAM 127117 157 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

areas to bring the mineralization present up to NI 43-101 compliant standards.  Inferred resources were 
calculated in all three areas, in addition to indicated resources at George-Ver.  
 
CAM recommends the following: 
 

1. Continue to resample historical holes, or drill twin holes, to obtain additional data compatible 
with current CIM standards, particularly as it relates to uranium/daughter equilibrium.  These 
resamples and redrills/twins  should concentrate on holes with missing elevations and should be 
uniformly distributed over the historical data, perhaps with a tendency to focus on economic-
grade intercepts.  Once it is validated that historical barren holes do not have potentially-
economic mineralization, the focus should shift to better-grade holes and  barren holes next to 
mineralization.  CAM suggests that this work be initially done on nominal 400-foot centers. 

2. Continue to try to obtain additional historical data and validate all historic data (see item 1).  In 
some cases this data may be lost or may be unavailable due to inter-company issues.  Notes on 
this should be included in future documents. 

3. Assure all of the data particularly historic data which are carried into spreadsheets have 
consistent column names and include NAD 83 coordinates. 

4. Review historic disturbance of surface topography relative to dates of drilling.  Disturbances 
include mining, backfill, waste dumps, and reclamation and CAM suggests that a surface map 
showing these four states of surface topography be developed.  Make an effort to define the 
surface representing the lowest open pit mining and the elevation of underground mining 
operations.  CAM excluded all material within known pit crests and within the plan area of 
known underground operations from the resource tabulation which may be conservative. 

5. Undertake further drilling to expand and upgrade the compliant mineral resources.

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
Strathmore's properties are in general surrounded by mineral properties held by others, including 
Cameco.  However, all of the samples used to evaluate the Strathmore properties are from within the 
Strathmore properties, and all of the mineral resources and mineral potential described herein lie entirely 
within the Strathmore properties. 
 
Cameco has been observed to be conducting exploration drilling on their claims in the Gas Hills District 
and is actively permitting an in-situ recovery operation in the Gas Hills to extract uranium.  Cameco has a 
Permit to Mine for the WDEQ-LQD (Permit #687) and a Source Materials License (SUA-1548) from the 
US NRC.  The US BLM recently completed a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (November 2012).  
Production is slated to begin in 2014 (Wyoming Business Report, Feb. 22, 2011).  The Cameco properties 
abut Strathmore's on Cameco's western, eastern and southern extents.  
 
On Cameco's website they report Mineral Reserves and Resources of:

Cautionary Statement 
 
It should be noted that the extent of mineral reserves and resources on Cameco's Gas Hill properties may 
not be indicative of the mineralization that is present or to be potentially discovered on Strathmore's 
adjacent properties.  The authors of this report have no access to Cameco's proprietary data and thus, 
cannot confirm their mineral reserves and resources.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The six project areas reviewed by CAM for the estimation of resources include: Bullrush; Day Loma, 
George-Ver; Loco-Lee; Rock Hill and Tablestakes.  All of these properties have significant historical 
resources and each has at least several hundred historical holes.  All of the properties have additional 
analyses by PFN which provides a direct measure of uranium as opposed to gamma logs which are an 
indirect measure of uranium through radiation from uranium daughter products.  In two of the areas, Day 
Loma and George-Ver, sufficient and consistent PFN and gamma log data was spatially distributed over 
the property to allow estimation of an indicated resource.  In five areas, Bullrush, Day Loma, George-Ver, 
Loco-Lee, and Rock Hill, sufficient and consistent PFN and gamma log data was spatially distributed 
over the property to allow estimation of an inferred resource.  The Tablestakes and Jeep project areas and 
Beaver Rim exploration area do not have sufficient data to allow measured, indicated and inferred 
resources to be calculated at this time. 
 
CAM believes that additional drilling, probing and sampling with direct measure of uranium will allow 
the mineralization to be defined as measured and indicated resources.  There is probably additional 
historical data which would be useful for Strathmore to pursue.  For the area covered by additional 
historical data (Andria, Amazon, Badlands, Frazier-Lamac, Sunset), CAM does not expect significant 
changes from the historical resource numbers to mineral resources as currently defined, but this 
expectation must be confirmed by additional data. 
 
In addition to the properties reviewed above that have abundant historical drill data, Strathmore's 
property also contains several exploration targets that merit further exploration.  Each target either 
contains known uranium mineralization as determined by historical exploration activities, or is adjacent to 
known uranium mineralization.  The characteristics of each target such as grade, length of mineralized 
trend, width or thickness can only be projected from nearby areas containing well-defined mineralized 
bodies.  These are exploration targets and merit further drilling.  CAM believes that these exploration 
targets could contain 3 to 12 million pounds of contained U3O8 that could potentially be economically 
recovered.  Additional exploration drilling is recommended for these targets.  The reader is cautioned 
that potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature; exploration activity has not been 
sufficient to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain that further exploration will result in the 
targets being delineated as a mineral resource.  The bases on which the disclosed potential 
quantities and grades have been determined are set forth in the discussion of each area in Section 
9.9 of this report. 
 
A large area on Strathmore's claim block with significant discovery potential lies to the south of Beaver 
Rim Divide.  Regional geologic studies and limited exploration drilling, both historic and by Strathmore, 
indicate that area is underlain by the arkose host rock favorable for uranium mineralization.  Geologic

features also suggest uranium roll fronts may be present.  Roll-uranium mineralization was discovered in 
the Allegreti trend area, but otherwise the collapse of the nuclear industry in 1979 prevented the follow-
up closely-spaced drilling   that would be required to define a deposit.  CAM concludes that the area south 
of Beaver Rim Divide has geologic features favorable for roll-type uranium mineralization.  CAMECO is 
reportedly in possession of results from historical drilling in this area, but at the date of this report, 
Strathmore has not had access to that data.  More exploration drilling clearly is justified in this area.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
Many of these recommendations involve items which CAM believes are required to bring historical data 
up to current NI 43-101 standards, including required documentation and chain of custody of the data.  
Although almost all the data was obtained from reputable mining companies and was apparently compiled 
according to accepted engineering practice at the time, current verification of this data is not possible.  
For example, the minimum for a drill hole to satisfy current practice there would have to be a traceable 
record of the collar location, downhole probing procedure, the gamma log from the probe (with data on 
probe calibration), and the factors used to calculate uranium from the area under the gamma log. 
 
26.1 Drilling database 
 
CAM recommends the following actions, as detailed in Section 14.10, above: 
 

1. Continue to resample historical holes, or drill twin holes, to obtain additional data compatible 
with current CIM standards, particularly as it relates to uranium/daughter equilibrium.  These 
resamples and redrills/twins  should concentrate on holes with missing elevations and should be 
uniformly distributed over the historical data, perhaps with a tendency to focus on economic-
grade intercepts.  Once it is validated that historical barren holes do not have potentially-
economic mineralization, the focus should shift to better-grade holes and  barren holes next to 
mineralization.  CAM suggests that this work be initially done on nominal 400-foot centers. 

2. Continue to try to obtain additional historical data and validate all historic data (see item 1).  In 
some cases this data may be lost or may be unavailable due to inter-company issues.  Notes on 
this should be included in future documents. 

3. Assure all of the data particularly historic data which are carried into spreadsheets have 
consistent column names and include NAD 83 coordinates. 

4. Review historic disturbance of surface topography relative to dates of drilling.  Disturbances 
include mining, backfill, waste dumps, and reclaimation and CAM suggests that a surface map 
showing these four states of surface topography be developed.  Make an effort to define the 
surface representing the lowest open pit mining and the elevation of underground mining 
operations.  CAM excluded all material within known pit crests and within the plan area of 
known underground operations from the resource tabulation which may be conservative. 

 
26.2 Exploration Methodology and Modeling 
 

1. Strathmore should continue the program whereby a certain proportion of the Strathmore-logged 
holes (initially at least 10%) are subjected to duplicate logging by certified independent parties.  
The proportion of duplicate-logged holes might be revised after review of initial results. 



 

 

CAM 127117 164 
Strathmore Gas Hills Uranium Project Update 
22 March 2013 

2. A program of determining tonnage factors should be undertaken, by systematic measurements 
of about 100 core samples which are sealed in cellophane prior to immersion.  This program 
should be supervised and carried out by Strathmore personnel, to avoid the problems which 
normally arise when such work is farmed out to an outside commercial laboratory. 

3. Undertake further drilling to expand and upgrade the compliant mineral resources. 
4. Review the potential for modeling individual roll fronts as separate units, even though this is 

contrary to historic practice in the Gas Hills because of the complexity and imbrication of the 
mineral stringers. 

5. Completions of the previously recommended Work Program, costing about $US 7.7 million, is 
recommended for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013.  The major remaining components of 
the Work Program are continuing exploration and confirmation drilling ($2.3 million) and 
metallurgical tests ($0.171 million) involving over 162,000 feet of drilling and gamma and PFN 
logging.  The Work Program drilling is for several purposes: 

a. to elevate the resource status from inferred to indicated and measured and increase 
indicated as warranted; 

b. to explore the trends and potential mineral targets discussed in Section 9 of this report, 
which may contain extensions of recognized mineralization; and 

c. to obtaining geologic information and indications of mineralization that will justify 
follow-up close-spaced exploration drilling through reconnaissance exploration drilling 
south of Beaver Rim divide. 

6. The other portions of the Work Program are intended to advance the design and permitting of 
the process facilities for eventual production and will likely extend thru 2013. 

 
26.3 Further Exploration 
 
Exploration drilling, undertaken to generate resource estimates compliant with NI 43-101 disclosure 
requirements, should continue on the five known deposit areas in the Main Gas Hills district.  This 
drilling is for several purposes: 

ï‚· to elevate the resource status in the five areas from inferred and indicted to indicated and 
measured as warranted; 

ï‚· to classify as NI 43-101-compliant resources those portions of the project areas which have 
historical tonnages, or insufficient drilling; and 

ï‚· to explore the trends discussed in Section 9 of this report, which may contain extensions of 
recognized mineralization.  

 
In addition, reconnaissance exploration drilling south of Beaver Rim divide should focus on obtaining 
geologic information and indications of mineralization that will justify follow-up close-spaced drilling.

A suggested completion of the budgeted work plan presented in the previous report for continued 
exploration at Gas Hills is shown on Table 26-1.  It is expected that the exploration could be completed 
by year-end 2013.  The drill holes should be rather uniformly distributed over the area of mineralization 
to be confirmed, although the precise locations will be based on reviews of geology and logistics.
