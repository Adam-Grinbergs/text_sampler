1 SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) has been retained by 

Crescent Resources Corp. (Crescent) to prepare a Technical Report on the Coronel 

Oviedo Uranium Project.  The purpose of this report is to provide an independent 

assessment of the potential for uranium mineralization in the vast property, which 

comprises approximately 504,500 ha in southeastern Paraguay.  The Technical Report is 

conformable to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  Scott Wilson 

RPA visited the project area on July 10, 2007, and again on October 13, 2007. 

 

Crescent is earning a 70% interest in the Coronel Oviedo Project from Coronel 

Oviedo Mining Company (Coronel) by paying US$500,000 cash, issuing 2.5 million 

shares in the capital of Crescent, spending US$5 million on exploration over three years, 

and completing a Prefeasibility Study on or before the fourth anniversary of the 

agreement with Coronel.  Coronel is a subsidiary of Transandes de Paraguay S.A. 

(Transandes), the property holders.  Upon completing the earn-in commitments, Crescent 

will become the operator of the Coronel Oviedo Project.  Transandes acquired the 

Coronel Oviedo mineral concession by map staking and by Ministerial Approval. 

 
CONCLUSIONS 

Based on our review of technical reports on past exploration and publications, Scott 

Wilson RPA concludes that: 

 
• The Coronel Oviedo Project area is underlain by Upper Permian to Carboniferous 

(UPC) continental, deltaic and marine sandstones of the Paraná basin, which hosts 
the Figueira uranium deposit in Brazil and includes a number of uranium 
occurrences in eastern Paraguay. 

 
• Twelve areas of uranium anomalies, with uranium content in the samples ranging 

from 0.033% eU3O8 to 0.153% eU3O8 (equivalent U3O8) are associated with units 
of subhorizontal sandstones.  The anomalous zones range from 30 cm to 5 m 
intersections of the sandstones situated from 30 m to 250 m below the surface.

• Of the eight diamond drill holes completed by Anschutz Corporation (Anschutz), 
of which seven were in the Tres Corrales target area during the early 1980s, four 
holes encountered anomalous radioactivity at depths ranging from 30 m to 150 m.  
One of these holes (272-T-14) intersected 0.153% U3O8 over 1.9 m at 150 m 
depth, and a 5 m thick radioactive anomaly at 67 m depth.  Another hole (251-T-
7) intersected 0.063% U3O8 over 30 cm. 

 
• Twenty-one of the 26 rotary holes were drilled by Anschutz into the UPC 

sandstones, and of these 21 holes 14 encountered anomalous radioactivity.  One 
of these holes (272-T-3) intersected 0.02% U3O8 over 3.9 m at 243 m depth, and 
0.03% U3O8 over 0.6 m at 247 m depth. 

 
• Of the 28 recent drill holes completed by Crescent in the Tres Corrales target 

area, eleven intersected significant uranium mineralization of ≥0.03% eU3O8 over 
intervals ranging from 0.3 m to 5.58 m.  The average thickness of these intercepts 
was 3.06 m with an average grade of 0.041% eU3O8 with an equivalent grade x 
thickness (eGT) value of 0.129. 

 
• Past and recent exploration has established some favourable criteria suggesting 

the possibility of sizeable uranium accumulations within the Coronel Oviedo 
Property.  These criteria are: 

o Radiometric anomalies detected from airborne radiometric surveys. 
o Occurrence of wide areas of Permo-Carboniferous sandstones. 
o Major north-northwest trending regional structure. 

 
• The style of uranium mineralization is that of sandstone hosted uranium 

mineralization.  Sandstone-type deposits are characteristically sedimentary 
formations of clastic-detrital origin containing reducing environments.  These 
deposits are usually tabular in shape and may occur in continental sandstones, 
deltaic or shallow marine environments. 

 
• Exploration data suggest that the likely environments of uranium mineralization 

are a coastal plain depositional system and a deltaic environment with fine-
grained sands containing some organic material, which could serve as reductant 
for the precipitation of uranium. 

 
• In general, the drill core samples collected by Scott Wilson RPA contain low 

grade uranium mineralization.  These values range from 0.6 ppm U to 7.4 ppm U.  
The drill core, however, was not assayed by Anschutz, and it is uncertain as to 
whether the sampled interval coincides directly with zones of mineralization 
identified from downhole logging. 

 
• In general, the exploration work and lithologic and radiometric logging 

procedures by Crescent are in keeping with industry standards. 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
1-3

• There is good potential for the discovery of additional uranium mineralization 
within the Coronel Oviedo mineral licence and further work is warranted. 

 
RECOMMENDATIONS 

Scott Wilson RPA recommends that Crescent continue with the reverse circulation 

(RC) drilling at Tres Corrales, as well as the regional exploration program.  The objective 

of this work is to discover uranium mineralization similar to known sandstone-hosted 

uranium deposits.  The recommended work would consist of: 

 
• A program of core drilling, which would allow estimation of mineral resources. 
 
• Continuation of the regional exploration program, involving additional drilling, to 

assess the exploration potential for uranium mineralization within the vast 
Coronel Oviedo mineral concession in southeastern Paraguay. 

 
• Metallurgical testing to assess the recovery of uranium in the sandstones by in-

situ leaching or by underground mining methods. 
 

Crescent has prepared a preliminary budget for 2008 in the order of US$3.6 million 

(Table 1-1).  This includes 20,000 m of rotary and diamond core drilling in Tres Corrales 

area followed by the preparation of a mineral resource estimate.  Scott Wilson RPA 

concurs with this program and budget.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 
OBJECTIVE 

Crescent's objectives in the Coronel Oviedo area in southeastern Paraguay are to 

confirm past results, outline economic uranium deposits and develop a uranium mine.  

The exploration target is sandstone-hosted uranium deposits that bear similarities to the 

roll front-type uranium deposits of the Powder River Basin, Wyoming, in the United 

States. 

 
PROPERTY STATUS 

The Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project is at an early to intermediate stage of 

exploration.  Several areas have received some drilling in the past by Anschutz and 

recently by Crescent.  The Tres Corrales area has the most drilling.  Other parts of the 

Coronel Oviedo Property are at an early stage of exploration.  Crescent is in the process 

of acquiring a 70% interest in the property from Transandes, a private company 

registered in Paraguay.  The Property consists of a large mineral concession covering a 

total area of approximately 504,500 ha in southeastern Paraguay.  Transandes acquired 

this mineral concession by map staking and by Ministerial approval. 

 
LOCATION AND ACCESS 

The Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project is located approximately 150 km east of 

Asunción, the capital of Paraguay.  The vast property lies within an area of low relief, 

ranging from 5 m to 10 m, and the elevation in the area is in the order of 150 m above 

mean sea level.  The geographic coordinates of the southern part of the property, where 

the bulk of past exploration has been carried out (Tres Corrales area), are approximately 

25°20'S and 56°10'W. 

 

Access to the Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project area is by roads.  The project area 

includes Coronel Oviedo, a town of approximately 48,000 people, and current 

exploration is being carried out from Tres Corrales, a village of approximately 250 

people.  Supplies and heavy equipment is brought to the community by trucks.

The climate in southeastern Paraguay is sub-tropical to temperate with little 

difference in seasonal temperature.  The mean temperature during the winter months 

(June to September, the "dry season") is 20°C and ranges from 15°C to 30°C.  The mean 

temperature during the summer months (December to March, the "rainy season") is 30°C 

and ranges from 25°C to 35°C.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 75 cm to 

150 cm.  Exploration in the Coronel Oviedo area may be carried out throughout the year, 

although there may be heavy rains during the summer months, which may cause 

temporary, short-term disruption of exploration activities and transportation of goods to 

the local communities. 

 

Local infrastructure is available at Coronel Oviedo and nearby towns.  Infrastructure 

at the site includes electrical power, cell phone network and road building equipment.  

Water, both industrial and potable, is drawn from wells.  The RC drilling equipment is 

brought from Argentina or Peru, since there are no RC drills available in Paraguay.  

Rotary drilling rigs are available in Asunción. 

 

The area is covered with extensive lateritic and saprolitic material, and outcrops are 

rare.  Vegetation consists predominantly of tall grass and fruit trees, typical of the pampas 

in Argentina and Paraguay.  Overburden cover ranges from 5 m to 15 m. 

 

The land in the southeastern part of Paraguay, and in particular the Coronel Oviedo 

area, is used mainly for agriculture by local villagers.  Wildlife in the area includes 

various species of frogs, turtles, snakes, birds (including white swan, parrots, hawk, field 

dove, Tucán and owl) foxes, ocelot (wild cat) tapir, wild boar, deer, and various species 

of insects. 

 
HISTORY 

Exploration for uranium in southeastern Paraguay was started in 1976 by Anschutz, 

after signing of the Concession Agreement with the Government of Paraguay in 

December 1975.  This agreement allowed Anschutz to explore for "all minerals, 

excluding oil, gas, and construction materials".  Previously intermittent exploration had

been carried out by international oil companies, with insignificant results.  The region, 

however, is known for its limited mining activities and production of high grade iron ore, 

mineral pigments clays, limestone, sandstone, sand and gravel by indigenous people. 

 

The initial uranium exploration by Anschutz covered an exclusive exploration-

exploitation concession of some 162,700 km2, virtually the whole eastern half of 

Paraguay.  This was followed by a program of diamond drilling and rotary drilling over 

selected target areas.  In total some 75,000 m of drilling was completed from 1976 to 

1983.  Anschutz carried out exploration on behalf of a Joint Venture with Korea Electric 

Power Corporation (Kepco) and Taiwan Power Company (Taiwan Power).  Anschutz 

intersected uranium mineralization in drill holes ranging from 0.115% U3O8 over 10.2 m 

to 0.351% U3O8 over 0.3 m in sandstones and siltstones.  Work was suspended in 1983 

due to the slump of the price of uranium, and no further work has been done since that 

time. 

 

During the exploration programs by Anschutz, airborne radiometric surveys, regional 

geological mapping and geochemical sampling were the main exploration tools for 

uranium exploration in the southeastern part of Paraguay.  This was followed-up by core 

and rotary drilling, in two phases.  The initial phase was to drill wide spaced 

reconnaissance diamond drill holes along fences spaced approximately 16 km apart.  The 

objective of this initial phase was to obtain stratigraphic information across an inferred 

host trend.  The second phase was to drill rotary holes, spaced approximately 0.5 km 

apart, within and between the fences of reconnaissance holes, to establish and outline 

target areas.  All drill holes were logged and probed by gamma, neutron and resistivity 

surveys. 

 

Exploration work by Anschutz outlined two large target areas underlain by the UPC, 

as follows: 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com

• Primary Target Area: This contains the San Antonio, San Miguel, Typychaty and 
Yarati-í targets near and around the village of Yuty, approximately 200 km 
southeast of Asunción. 

 
• Other Targets of Interest: These targets include two areas situated northeast and 

north of the Town of Coronel Oviedo, approximately 150 km east of Asunción. 
 

In April 16, 2007, Crescent signed an Option Agreement with Coronel Oviedo 

Mining Company (Coronel, a subsidiary of Transandes) to earn a 70% interest in the 

Coronel Oviedo Project, and started a systematic exploration program including 

compilation of previous results and RC drilling in the Tres Corrales area.  Presently, this 

work is in progress. 

 
GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

The Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project area is situated within the western part of the 

Paraná Basin in southeastern Paraguay.  The Paraná Basin hosts a number of uranium 

occurrences, including the Figueira uranium deposit in Brazil and the San Antonio zone 

near the town of Yuty in southeastern Paraguay.  The area is underlain by Upper Permian 

to Carboniferous continental sedimentary rocks, and is known for uranium occurrences.  

Significant radiometric anomalies also occur in Precambrian igneous and metamorphic 

rocks, Cambrian limestone, Silurian sandstone and Cretaceous to Tertiary carbonatites 

and alkaline intrusive rocks. 

 

Uranium mineralization at Coronel Oviedo is also similar to that at the Amorinópolis 

deposit hosted by Devonian sandstones in Goiás State, Brazil. 

 

The exploration methodology applied during past programs has been to determine the 

favourable host rocks of the UPC sequence, and explore favourable areas of the host 

sandstone. 

 
Continental sedimentary units of the Independencia Formation (of the UPC) are 

known to have high potential for uranium exploration in eastern Paraguay.  This unit is 

recognized within the northern part of the UPC in eastern Paraguay and is known as 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
1-8

Northern UPC (NUPC).  Early work also suggests that the basal sandstone, a 20 m to 90 

m thick unit known as the San Miguel Formation (within the Independencia Formation) 

to be the best host for uranium mineralization in the Coronel Oviedo area.  Earlier work 

further suggests that the San Miguel Formation can be correlated with the Rio Benito 

Formation in the uranium bearing Permian rocks near Figueira, in the Paraná Basin in 

Brazil.  The source of the uranium is thought to be the Lower Permian-Carboniferous 

Coronel Oviedo Formation, which is correlated with the Itataré Formation underlying the 

Rio Benito Formation in Brazil.  Outcrops are rare, mostly along road cuts, and mapping 

is done by drilling. 

 

The dominant structural feature in the area is the north-northwest trending 

topographic lineament/fault in the south-central part of the mineral concession.  This 

lineament also coincides with an airborne magnetic lineament. 

 

The rocks of the Coronel Oviedo area are very gently east dipping and undeformed.  

Other northwest and northeast trending normal faults cut the sedimentary units. 

 

Exploration work to date suggests the uranium mineralization within the 

Independencia Formation to be stratabound and possibly syngenetic or diagenetic in 

origin.  Recent interpretation of exploration data suggests that areas of limonite+hematite 

alteration within the grey-green, fine grained sandstones in the Tres Corrales area have 

characteristics similar to the alteration assemblages present at roll front-type uranium 

deposits of the Powder River basin in the United States. 

 
EXPLORATION 

On April 16, 2007, Crescent commenced a systematic uranium exploration program 

including compilation of all previous exploration data by Anschutz in the Coronel Oviedo 

Uranium Project area, such as lithologic and radiometric logs stored at Ministry of Public 

Works (MOPC) in Asunción.  Since August 2007, Crescent has been carrying on a 

program of drilling at Tres Corrales as well as evaluating other uranium target areas on 

the Coronel Oviedo Property.

DRILLING AND SAMPLING 
Approximately 4,970 m of core drilling was completed in 21 holes by Anschutz in 

previous campaigns.  NQ core was retrieved and the drilling contractor was Geosol from 

Belo Horizonte, Brazil.  In addition, approximately 10,980 m of drilling was completed 

in 51 holes by Anschutz by rotary drill rigs. 

 

The procedures used during the diamond and rotary drilling programs were drafted by 

Anschutz.  Scott Wilson RPA reviewed a number of drill logs at the (MOPC) in 

Asunción.  Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the lithologic logging procedures are 

comparable to Western industry standards. 

 

Detailed information on sampling method and approach during the Anschutz drilling 

campaigns is not available.  Nevertheless, Scott Wilson RPA understands that sampling 

procedures were comparable to Western industry standards of that time.  These included: 

 
• Sampling of the whole core of diamond drill holes, with sample intervals of 

approximately 30 cm (1 ft.). 
 
• Calculation of equivalent uranium grades from radiometric (gamma) logs. 
 

Since mid-August 2007, Crescent has completed approximately 7,640 m of RC 

drilling in 28 holes at the Tres Corrales target area (four holes were abandoned before 

reaching the target depth).  One drill was brought in from Argentina and the drilling 

contractor is Compañia Paraguaya de Minería (COPAMI, a subsidiary of Northwest 

Drilling (Northwest) of Buenos Aires, Argentina.  This rig has drilled 18 holes.  The 

other ten holes were drilled by a rotary rig contracted from 9 de Junio, a company based 

in Asunción, Paraguay. 

 

The procedures used during the recent drilling program were reviewed and verified 

by Scott Wilson RPA.  Scott Wilson RPA reviewed a number of drill logs and is of the 

opinion that the lithologic and radiometric logging procedures are in keeping with 

industry standards.  These include: 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
1-10

• Splitting the RC drill chips with a riffle and sampling half of the chips (5 kg to 7 
kg), with sample intervals of two metres. 

 
• Calculation of equivalent uranium grades from radiometric (gamma) logs. 
 

DATA VERIFICATION 
During the early exploration in the area by Anschutz, data verification was done by 

company geologists.  Data on quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures, 

however, are not available.  Recently, Crescent has carried out a review of the calculation 

of equivalent uranium grades (eU3O8) from a number of Anschutz holes.  Scott Wilson 

RPA understands that the two results are comparable.  Scott Wilson RPA also 

understands that the drill hole data were verified by Crescent as part of the recent 

compilation program.  In terms of recording field data, Crescent has established detailed 

procedures for technical staff. 

 

During the recent site visits, Scott Wilson RPA reviewed the Crescent exploration 

results and the methodology of lithologic and radiometric logging of drill holes by 

Crescent crews.  Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the field practices used by 

Crescent crews are in keeping with industry standards. 

 

As a check of past exploration results, Scott Wilson RPA collected eight independent 

samples (four each from diamond drill hole 272-T14 and 272-R2) of the Tres Corrales 

target area and sent them to SGS Laboratories, Don Mills, Ontario (SGS), for analysis.  

The uranium determinations were done at the Becquerel Laboratories, Hamilton, Ontario, 

on behalf of SGS, using the Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) method.  The sample 

intervals cannot be compared with earlier results, because Anschutz did not sample the 

drill core.  The Scott Wilson RPA samples yielded low uranium values ranging from 0.6 

ppm U to 7.4 ppm U. 

 
MINERAL RESOURCES 

There are no mineral resources within the area of the Coronel Oviedo Uranium 

Project at the present time.

EXPLORATION POTENTIAL 
The Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project is at an early to intermediate stage of 

exploration.  A number of areas of anomalous concentrations of uranium occur in Upper 

Permian to Carboniferous sedimentary rocks within the property area.  Past work was 

focused on developing roll front-type targets.  Preliminary interpretation of drill results in 

the Tres Corrales area suggests that the basal sandstone unit (Providencia Formation) is 

the favourable host for uranium mineralization. 

 

There are other areas of anomalous uranium within the Coronel Oviedo Project area, 

such as along the north-northwest trending lineament and elsewhere on the property.  

These areas warrant further exploration work.

2 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF 
REFERENCE 

Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) has been retained by 

Crescent Resources Corp. (Crescent) to prepare a Technical Report on the Coronel 

Oviedo Uranium Project.  The purpose of this report is to provide our independent 

assessment of the potential for uranium mineralization in the vast property, which 

comprises approximately 504,500 ha in southeastern Paraguay (Figure 2-1).  The 

Technical Report is conformable to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 

Projects.  Scott Wilson RPA visited the project area on July 10, 2007 and again on 

October 13, 2007. 

 

Crescent is a reporting issuer in British Columbia and Alberta, and is listed on the 

TSX Venture Exchange with its office in Vancouver.  The company is a Tier 2 issuer.  

On April 16, 2006, Crescent signed an option agreement with Coronel Oviedo Mining 

Company (Coronel), a subsidiary of Transandes de Paraguay S.A. (Transandes, the 

property holders) to earn up to 70% interest in the Coronel Oviedo Concession in 

southeastern Paraguay (Crescent Corp. Press Release, June 12, 2007). 

 

Crescent is earning a 70% interest in the Coronel Oviedo Project from Coronel by 

paying US$500,000 cash, issuing 2.5 million shares in the capital of Crescent, spending 

US$5 million on exploration over three years, and completing a Prefeasibility Study on or 

before the fourth anniversary of the agreement with Coronel.  Upon completing the earn-

in commitments, Crescent will become the operator of the Coronel Oviedo Project.  

Transandes acquired the Coronel Oviedo mineral concession by map staking and by 

Ministerial Approval. 

 

Currently, Servicios Mineros S.A. (Seminsa), a subsidiary of Transandes, is the 

operator of the project and Búscore Consulting de Paraguay S.A. (Buscore) provides 

contract exploration services to Seminsa/Crescent.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
PROPERTY STATUS 

Except for the Tres Corrales area, the Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project is at an early 

stage of exploration.  The Tres Corrales area is at an intermediate stage, since it has 

received some drilling in the past by Anschutz and currently by Crescent.  The property 

consists of one large mineral concession covering a total area of approximately 504,500 

ha in southeastern Paraguay.  The property is located approximately 150 km east of 

Asunción, the Capital of Paraguay, and includes the area surrounding the town of 

Coronel Oviedo.  It is situated within the Districts of Juan de Mena, Itacurubí del 

Rosario, Guayaibí, San Estanislao, Yataity del Norte, Unión, 25 de Diciembre, Santa 

Rosa del Mbuty, Simón Bolivar, San Joaquín, Cecilio Báez, Carayaó, Coronel Oviedo, 

Caaguazú R.I. 13 Corrales, and La Pastora, Departments of San Pedro, Cordillera y 

Caaguazú, Eastern Paraguay. 

 

Crescent is earning a 70% interest in the Coronel Oviedo Prospecting Licence from 

Coronel Oviedo Mining Company S.A. (Coronel), a subsidiary of Transandes de 

Paraguay S.A. (Transandes), a private company registered in Paraguay.  Transandes 

acquired the Coronel Oviedo mineral concession by map staking and approval by the 

Ministério de Obras Públicas y Comunicaciones (MOPC), as described below. 

 

The mineral concession was issued by Ing. Pánfilo Benítez E., Minister, MOPC, and 

Jorge Coronel, Interim Director General of Secretariat of Environment (Secretaría del 

Medio Ambiente "SEAM").  The coordinates of the vertices of the rectangular area for 

the prospecting licence are shown in Figure 4-1 and provided in Table 4-1.

o On or before the third anniversary date of the Effective Date, Crescent 
shall be further required to make cash payments of US$500,000 or, subject 
to regulatory approval, issue shares in the capital of Crescent, and fund an 
additional US$2.5 million of expenditures in order to maintain its 50% 
interest in the property.  In the event that Crescent fails to satisfy its 
funding obligations pursuant to the above, Crescent shall lose its 50% 
interest in the property. 

 
• Coronel grants to Crescent the sole and exclusive right and option (Additional 

Option) to earn an additional 20% interest in the property by funding for a 
Prefeasibility Study on the property on or before the fourth year anniversary of 
the Effective Date.  Should Crescent extend the completion of the Prefeasibility 
Study to the fifth year anniversary of the Effective Date, Crescent shall pay a 
further US$500,000 to Coronel. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA understands that "there is no public or private litigation, 

arbitration, option or understanding pending or threatened involving any of the Property 

or Coronel or any of its Affiliates which may, if adversely determined, materially and 

adversely affect the Property or the interests of Coronel therein or which seeks to or 

would, if successful, prevent, restrain or prohibit any of the transactions contemplated" in 

the Option Agreement (Seminsa, 2007a). 

 

Scott Wilson further understands that "to the best of its knowledge, information and 

belief, there are no outstanding orders or directions relating to environmental matters 

requiring any work, repairs, construction or capital expenditures with respect to the 

Property and the conduct of operations related" to exploration activities (Seminsa, 

2007a).

4-4

OPERATING AGREEMENT 
On April 16, 2007, Crescent, Coronel and Seminsa also entered into an Operating 

agreement whereby, subject to the terms of the Option Agreement, Crescent agreed that 

Seminsa will be the operator of the joint venture until such time that Crescent earns its 

50% interest in the Coronel Oviedo Property.  Crescent further agreed that Coronel has 

the right to subcontract the operatorship of the project to Seminsa (Seminsa, 2007b). 

 

LAND TENURE 

Scott Wilson RPA understands that all the mineral lands of the Coronel Oviedo 

Uranium Property are in good standing for the foreseeable future (Fialayre, 2007). 

 

MINERAL LICENCES 

Under the Paraguay Mining Law, the Coronel Oviedo Uranium Mineral Licence is 

map-staked, and hence does not have physical boundaries.  A map-staked licence may be 

in good standing for an indefinite period.  All mineral licences are drawn using the 

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system.  The following is a summary 

of the Mining Law, regarding mineral exploration in Paraguay (Law No. 3180, April 30, 

2007). 

 
• Application for mineral prospecting work over a specific area to the MOPC, 

addressed to Vice Ministry of Mines and Energy, by the Chairman of the 
company which is planning to conduct exploration.  The amount of required 
investment (exploration work): 

o For an initial (Prospecting) stage licence it is US$15/ha. 
o For an exploration stage licence it is US$45/ha.  In case the licence is 

renewed, the amount of investment required may increase by 20%, 
depending on the status of the property, i.e., whether it is at the 
Prospecting or Exploration stage. 

o For exploitation (development) stage licence it is 30% of the amount 
required for the exploration stage of the property. 

 
• Approval (or rejection) by the Vice Minister and the Department of Environment 

(SEAM).  This is followed by a Municipal Localization Certificate and 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
4-5

Departmental Interest Certificate from the Department (like a Province) for the 
area of interest. 

 
• Publication of the request in a newspaper, such as La Nación in Asunción. 
 
• If there is no objection from the public, the MOPC grants a Prospecting Licence 

to the applicant for a period of eight months.  In some cases this may be extended 
to a further six months.  No assessment or minimum work is required at this stage.  
The applicant only has to submit trimestral reports to the MOPC. 

 
• Signing of a contract with the Government of Paraguay for Prospecting, 

Exploration, and Exploitation work (Permits) in a specific area.  The annual 
licence fee: 

o For a Prospecting Permit ranges from US$0.35/ha to US$0.55/ha, as 
follows: 

 1 ha to 500 ha   US$0.55/ha 
 501 ha to 1,500 ha  US$0.50/ha 
 1,501 ha to 10,000 ha  US$0.45/ha 
 10,101 ha to 50,000 ha US$0.40/ha 
 50,001 ha to 100,000 ha US$0.35/ha 

 
o For an Exploration Permit ranges from US$0.55/ha to US$1.00/ha, as 

follows: 
 1 ha to 500 ha   US$0.55/ha 
 501 ha to 1,500 ha  US$0.70/ha 
 1,501 ha to 10,000 ha  US$0.85/ha 
 10,101 ha to 50,000 ha US$1.00/ha 

 
o For an Exploitation (Development stage) Permit ranges from US$1.50/ha 

to US$2.25/ha, as follows: 
 1 ha to 500 ha   US$1.50/ha 
 501 ha to 1,500 ha  US$1.75/ha 
 1,501 ha to 10,000 ha  US$2.00/ha 
 10,101 ha to 25,000 ha US$2.25/ha 

 
o Upon completion of the exploration phase, the exploitation phase starts, by 

which time the applicant must have reduced the size of the property, and 
the new property is granted.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
LOCATION 

The Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project is located approximately 150 km east of 

Asunción, the capital of Paraguay.  The vast property lies within an area of low relief, 

ranging from 5 m to 10 m.  The elevation in the area is in the order of 150 m above mean 

sea level.  The geographic coordinates of the southern part of the property, where the 

bulk of past exploration has been carried out (Tres Corrales area), are approximately 

25°20'S and 56°10'W. 

 

ACCESS 

Access to the Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project area is by roads.  The project area 

includes Coronel Oviedo, a town of approximately 48,000 people, and current 

exploration is being carried out from Tres Corrales, a village of approximately 250 

people.  Supplies and heavy equipment is brought to the community by trucks. 

 

CLIMATE 

The climate in southeastern Paraguay is sub-tropical to temperate with little 

difference in seasonal temperature.  The mean temperature during the winter months 

(June to September, the "dry season") is 20°C and ranges from 15°C to 30°C.  The mean 

temperature during the summer months (December to March, the "rainy season") is 30°C 

and ranges from 25°C to 35°C.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 75 cm to 

150 cm.  Exploration in the Coronel Oviedo area may be carried out throughout the year, 

although there may be heavy rains during the summer months, which may cause 

temporary, short-term disruption of exploration activities and transportation of goods to 

the local communities. 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
5-2

INFRASTRUCTURE 

Local infrastructure is available at the town of Coronel Oviedo and nearby villages.  

Infrastructure at the site includes electrical power, cell phone network and road building 

equipment.  Water, both industrial and potable, is drawn from wells.  The reverse 

circulation (RC) drilling equipment is brought from Argentina or Peru, since there are no 

RC drills available in Paraguay.  Rotary drilling rigs are available in Asunción. 

 

LAND USE 

The area is covered with extensive lateritic and saprolitic material, and outcrops are 

rare.  Vegetation consists predominantly of tall grass and fruit trees, typical of the pampas 

in Argentina and Paraguay.  Overburden cover ranges from 5 m to 15 m. 

 

FAUNA AND FLORA 

The land in the southeastern part of Paraguay, and in particular the Coronel Oviedo 

area, is used mainly for agriculture by local villagers.  Wildlife in the area includes 

various species of frogs, turtles, snakes, birds (including white swan, parrots, hawk, field 

dove, Tucán and owl) foxes, ocelot (wild cat) tapir, wild boar, deer, and various species 

of insects (Naturavita, 2006).

6 HISTORY 
Exploration for uranium in southeastern Paraguay was started in 1976 by Anschutz, 

after signing of the Concession Agreement with the Government of Paraguay in 

December 1975.  This agreement allowed Anschutz to explore for "all minerals, 

excluding oil, gas, and construction materials" over an exclusive exploration-exploitation 

concession covering some 162,700 km2, virtually the whole eastern half of Paraguay.  

Previously intermittent exploration had been carried out by international oil companies, 

with insignificant results.  The region, however, is known for its limited mining activities 

and production of high grade iron ore, mineral pigments, clays, limestone, sandstone, 

sand and gravel by indigenous people. 

 

In early 1976, a number of reports prepared by Anschutz consultants A.F. Renfro, 

D.G. Bryant, and G.E. Thomas, covered the geology of eastern Paraguay based on 

reconnaissance field trips made through the southern Precambrian area, the sedimentary 

section from north to south, and the alkalic intrusions in the north-central part of a large 

concession.  Based on field examinations and airborne radiometric data, Renfro 

concluded that the Anschutz Concession contained areas with good potential for uranium 

mineralization (Pearson, 1981).  The regional correlation of stratigraphic horizons 

favourable for uranium mineralization is shown in Figures 6-1 and 6-2 (Anschutz, 1981). 

 

The initial uranium exploration by Anschutz included geological mapping, water 

sampling, soil sampling and a broad reconnaissance Track Etch program, with stations 

spaced 10 km apart.  The station spacing for the Track Etch survey was subsequently 

reduced to 5 km in the southern part of the concession.  The reconnaissance program 

outlined large anomalous zones and Anschutz concluded that the concession constituted a 

new uranium province in an area underlain by granitic rocks and sandstones (Dunlop, 

1979). 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
6-2

The initial reconnaissance program by Anschutz was followed by a program of 

airborne radiometric and magnetic surveys, detailed Track Etch survey, with station 

spacing of 100 m to 200 m, geochemical stream sediment and soil sampling and diamond 

drilling and rotary drilling over selected target areas (Figures 6-3 and 6-4).  In total, some 

75,000 m of drilling was completed from 1976 to 1983 (Grote, 1979 and Dalidowicz, 

1979).  Flight line spacing for the airborne radiometric survey was 5 km with a clearance 

of 100 m above the surface. 

 

Exploration work by Anschutz has intersected uranium mineralization in drill holes 

ranging from 0.02% eU3O8 to 0.20% eU3O8 (equivalent U3O8) associated with layers of 

subhorizontal sandstones, and higher grade intersections ranging from 0.115% eU3O8 

over 10.2 m to 0.351% eU3O8 over 0.3 m in sandstones and siltstones (Anschutz, 1981).  

These results are shown in Table 25-1 (Appendix B).  Scott Wilson RPA notes that the 

higher grades were recorded on the neighbouring Yuty Property.  Work was suspended in 

1983 due to the slump of the price of uranium, and no further work has been done since 

that time.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

The Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project area is situated in southeastern Paraguay, 

within the western part of the Paraná Basin, which hosts the Figueira uranium deposit in 

Brazil (Figure 7-1).  The area is underlain by Upper Permian to Carboniferous continental 

sedimentary rocks, and is known for uranium occurrences, such as the Tres Corrales and 

Santa Catalina occurrences within the Coronel Oviedo Project area, and the Yarati-í and 

San Antonio occurrences within the neighbouring Yuty Project area.  Significant 

radiometric anomalies also occur in Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks, 

Cambrian limestone, Silurian sandstone and Cretaceous to Tertiary carbonatites and 

alkaline intrusive rocks. 

 

The exploration methodology applied during past programs has been to locate the 

favourable host rocks of the Upper Permian-Carboniferous (UPC) sequence, and 

determine favourable areas for uranium mineralization within the host sandstone. 

 
The stratigraphic sequence of the lithologies in the Coronel Oviedo Project area has 

been divided into the Northern UPC (NUPC) rocks and Lower Permian-Carboniferous 

(LPC) rocks.  From top to bottom, the regional stratigraphy is recognized as follows: 

 
• Tacuari Formation: approximately 350 m thick silty to fine-to-medium-grained 

sandstones. 
• San Miguel Formation: approximately 100 m of coarse-grained sandstones in the 

upper part and medium-grained and fine-grained and silty sandstones in the lower 
part. 

• Coronel Oviedo Formation (LPC): at least 200 m thick sequence of siltstones. 
 

The NUPC is interpreted to cover an area more than 4,000 km2, which includes most 

of the Coronel Oviedo Project area.  This is based on reconnaissance drilling by 

Anschutz, with drill holes spaced 5 km to 10 km apart. 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
7-2

The rocks of the UPC are subhorizontal (dipping 1° to 5° to the east) and cover the 

western flank of the Paraná Basin.  Data from reconnaissance drilling indicate that "the 

basin margin is cut by a series of west and northwest trending faults, with displacements 

ranging from a few metres to several hundred metres" (Blair, 2006 and Figure 7-1). 

 

Continental sedimentary units of the Independencia Formation (of the UPC) are 

known to have high potential for uranium exploration in eastern Paraguay.  Earlier work 

also suggests that the basal sandstone, a 20 m to 90 m thick unit known as the San Miguel 

Formation (within the Independencia Formation), to be the best host for uranium 

mineralization from the Coronel Oviedo to the Yuty area.  Earlier work further suggests 

that the San Miguel Formation can be correlated with the Rio Benito Formation in the 

uranium bearing Permian rocks near Figueira, in the Paraná Basin in Brazil.  The source 

of the uranium is thought to be the Lower Permian-Carboniferous Coronel Oviedo 

Formation, which is correlated with the Itataré Formation underlying the Rio Benito 

Formation in Brazil.  Occasional diabase sills and dikes intrude the sedimentary rocks, 

such as at the San Antonio area near the town of Yuty.  Outcrops are rare, mostly along 

road cuts, and mapping is done by drilling. 

 

The Massive Sand Unit of the NUPC overlies the fine grained sand which hosts the 

mineralized layers in the NUPC, near (within 10 m to 20 m of) the LPC-UPC contact.  

The uranium mineralization is best developed in areas of thinner sands flanking thicker 

accumulations of sands, which may be due to pre-sedimentation faulting, changes in 

sedimentation in a deltaic environment or infilling of previously existing erosional 

features of the LPC surface.  Figure 7-3 is a regional (east-west) cross section showing 

the correlation of the stratigraphic units of the fine-grained sand unit of the Northern 

UPC, a distance of 16 km. 

 

Airborne magnetic survey results indicate a north-northwest trending lineament 

which coincides with a similarly oriented topographic lineament.  In the past Anschutz 

recognized this feature and tentatively interpreted as being the surface expression of a 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
7-3

major regional fault or fracture zone (Figure 7-4).  This was interpreted from the apparent 

offset of marker horizons from widely spaced regional drill holes.  Anschutz, however, 

did not test the mineral potential of this fault zone (Hsu, 1982b). 

 

In a recent publication on the sedimentary and tectonic environments for uranium 

mineralization in South America, Barretto (2006?) suggests that the source of the 

sedimentary rocks, and thus the uranium mineralization in the Paraná Basin, was from the 

west.  The author also comments on the host rock of uranium mineralization at Figueira 

(carbonaceous siltstone and coal) which poses problems for metallurgical recovery of the 

uranium.  It must be noted, however, that these same carbonaceous rocks have not been 

seen on the western flanks of the basin (i.e., in Paraguay). 

 

There are a number of alkaline complexes within the Coronel Oviedo Property.  

These are interpreted to consist of carbonatite bodies with anomalous values of rare earth 

elements (REE), such as at Cerro Sarambí and Cerro Guazú.  Trenching along the 

northeastern and southwestern extensions of Chirigüelo has revealed values in the range 

of 0.5% Nb in soil samples (Druecker, 1981). 

 

The area of the Coronel Oviedo Property also has undergone a number of igneous 

activities subsequent to the long period of sedimentation.  The evidence for the igneous 

activity are the Permian volcanic rocks (lavas and ashes) syngenetic to the sedimentation, 

Jurassic and Cretaceous volcanic activity, such as the Serra Geral basalt flows covering 

"A" Sandstone discussed below in Local Geology, and the alkaline intrusive rocks, as 

noted above (Oh, 1978c).

LOCAL GEOLOGY 

Since the Coronel Oviedo Property is a large property, much of the local geology is 

the same as the regional geology.  Based on information from reconnaissance drilling 

Anschutz had divided the Northern UPC into several target areas, as discussed under 

Section 10, Exploration in this report. 

 

Results of the 1980 to 1981 exploration drilling indicate that the stratigraphic 

sequence of the rocks in the area comprises a number of sandy units, and that the 

depositional environment was of two types: a shallow marine environment and a deltaic 

environment (Oh, 1979).  In descending stratigraphic order, these are: 

 
• Upper Sand Unit: Estimated to be 50 m to 150 m thick. 
• Alternating sandstone and shale unit: Estimated to be approximately 50 m thick. 
• Massive Sand Unit: Estimated to be 60 m to 100 m thick. 
• Fine-grained Sand Unit: Estimated to be up to 15 m thick. 
• Wavy Unit: Estimated to be up to 20 m thick 
 

UPPER SAND UNIT 
The Upper Sand Unit is comprised essentially of massive, locally cross-bedded 

medium- to fine-grained sandstone with some clay interbeds.  It is exposed in the 

southeastern part of the area, where it is overlain by the Misiones Aeolian sand.  It is 

equivalent to the Tapytá Formation of the Southern UPC.  Strong oxidation and 

distinctively low radiometric response are the characteristic features of this unit in the 

area (Anschutz, 1981). 

 

The Upper Sands units of the NUPC are divided according to lithologic facies into the 

"A" Sandstone Unit and the "B" Sandstone Unit.  The two units were contemporaneously 

deposited and cover the Alternating Unit "just after a regression without erosional 

periods" (Oh, 1978c). 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
7-8

The "A" Sandstone Unit was deposited in fluvial and partly lacustrine environment.  

It consists of medium, medium-to-fine-grained, or fine-grained sandstones, coloured 

brown, reddish brown, light brown, pale pink, whitish, light grey, etc.  It is well cross 

bedded and partly limonitic, with some lacustrine mudstone fragments.  It crops out near 

Ybyturuzu and is estimated to be approximately 150 m thick. 

 

The "B" Sandstone Unit crops out extensively in the eastern portion of the area, and 

consists of medium-to-fine-grained sandstones, eolian fine-grained sandstones and 

lacustrine sandstones. 

 

ALTERNATING SANDSTONE AND SHALE UNIT 
This unit occurs more commonly in the Northern UPC region.  For the most part, it is 

comprised of thinly laminated, fine-grained to silty layers of sandstone alternating with 

shale layers.  In places, this sequence is interrupted "by a one-metre-thick sandstone layer 

which scours into the beds underlying them" (Anschutz, 1981).  This unit in the Northern 

UPC is tentatively correlated with the Tacuary Formation of the Southern UPC. 

 

The sandstones of this unit exhibit graded bedding, with conglomeratic material at the 

base to medium-grained sandstone to fine-grained sandstone at the top.  Oolitic chert 

horizons are present in the lower part of the Alternating Sandstone and Shale Unit and 

can be used as a marker horizon in the interpretation of the stratigraphy of the general 

area.  In a 1979 Anschutz report it is reported that "at the lower most portion of RD-76 an 

oolitic chert bed similar to silica bed was detected, but not found at any other holes.  

Stratigraphic columns of RD-73 and RD-74 (indicate) that a loose cemented, reduced 

arkosic and medium grained sandstone body is interbedded as a lenticular shape with 

maximum sixty meters (metres) thickness, which might be a sand bar in a (an) off shore 

environment.  It is considered (that) this sand bar may be one of the favourable host rocks 

for secondary uranium mineralization" (Oh, 1979).

Gamma-ray logs of several holes drilled in the Santa Catalina-Cuarto Potrero area 

have shown three separate horizons of radioactivity and/or weak uranium mineralization.  

The mineralized horizons occur within the lower 60 m of the Alternating Sandstone and 

Shale Unit (Reese, 1982 and Lunceford, 2007). 

 

MASSIVE SAND UNIT 
The Massive Sand Unit is characterized by generally massive, occasionally cross-

bedded, coarse- to medium-grained, rounded, poorly sorted, friable, sub-arkosic 

sandstone, and is interpreted to represent a beach facies (Anschutz, 1981).  This unit is 

the most commonly mineralized unit on the Coronel Oviedo Property. 

 

In the western part of the Coronel Oviedo area, the Massive Sand Unit is intensely 

oxidized.  In the east, it exhibits a reducing environment "with abundant pyrite and 

moderate to abundant amounts of carbonaceous material.  These reduced sands within the 

Massive Sand Unit contain several gamma anomalies and/or weakly mineralized horizons 

throughout the unit" (Anschutz, 1981).  Anschutz interpreted the uranium mineralization 

within this unit to be of tabular type. 

 

FINE-GRAINED SAND UNIT 
"The Fine-grained Sand Unit represents a regressive depositional change from a 

shallow marine to a beach environment." (Anschutz, 1981)  Only minor radiometric 

anomalies are reported from this unit.  In the Cuarto Potrero area this unit is 12 m to 19 m 

thick, and "consists of fine-to medium grained, bleached sandstones with no apparent 

pyrite, sandwiched by >1 m thick of compact, reduced very fine grained sandstone and 

siltstone" (Reese, 1982). 

 

Based on limited drilling, Anschutz detected weak uranium mineralization at the top 

and bottom of this unit, and interpreted it to be of roll front type.

Recent drilling by Crescent has intersected zones with weak to strong radioactive 

response in this unit.  The type of mineralization, however, is not yet determined. 

 

WAVY UNIT 
This unit overlies the black shale unit of the LPC.  It contains fine to very fine-

grained sandstone interlayered with siltstones and shales.  "Wavy, flaser, lenticular and 

bioturbated structures are present.  A few ±20 cm thick, indurated fine grained sandstone 

stringers within the unit show strong radiometric anomalies" (Anschutz, 1981).  Thirty-

four of the 48 drill holes penetrating this unit encountered oxidized/reduced zones, 

suggesting the possibility of uranium mineralization.  This mineralization, however, was 

interpreted to represent syngenetic uranium mineralization and is less prospective than 

the overlying units of the NUPC (Reese, 1982). 

 

The Massive Sand Unit, Fine-Grained Unit and the Wavy Unit are collectively 

correlated with the San Miguel Formation of the Southern UPC. 

 

TECTONIC SETTING 

The rocks of the Coronel Oviedo Uranium Property were deposited in a shallow 

marine to continental environment.  Review of airborne magnetic survey results indicate 

a north-northwest trending lineament which coincides with a similarly oriented 

topographic lineament, as noted above.  The trace of this lineament is interpreted to be 

east of drill hole 251-R-3, passing through between holes 251-R-1 and 252-T-2 and 

between holes 271-T-4 and 271-R-1 (Figures 7-4, 7-5, 7-6, 7-7 and 7-8).  The magnetic 

anomaly roughly coincides with the redox boundary of massive sandstone unit.  Anschutz 

planned to test this lineament by drilling, but did not carry out the recommended 

program, probably due to the drop of the price of uranium.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
Uranium mineralization hosted by the basal Independencia Formation of the Northern 

UPC is interpreted to represent a sandstone hosted uranium mineralization.  Sandstone-

type deposits are characteristically sedimentary formations of clastic-detrital origin 

containing reducing environments.  These deposits are usually tabular in shape and may 

occur in continental sandstones, deltaic or shallow marine environments. 

 

In the past some of the anomalous radioactive zones and weak mineralization 

intersected in drill holes were interpreted to represent roll front-type uranium 

mineralization.  Typically, roll front-type uranium deposits have, in the direction of the 

flow of ore bearing solutions, a barren (oxidized) interior zone surrounded by a (reduced) 

mineralized zone.  Between the barren zone and the mineralized zone is an altered zone.  

The overall shape of the roll front is like a crescent with extended tails at each end, which 

also outline the barren interior zone, and uranium is deposited at the interface between 

the oxidized zone and the reduced zone.  Ground water flow direction is usually a good 

guide in detecting roll front-type deposits in sandstones. 

 

While the style of mineralization within the sandstones at Coronel Oviedo does 

include some characteristics of the roll front-type mineralization, as in the Powder River 

Basin of Wyoming in the United States, further exploration is required to determine the 

style of mineralization at Coronel Oviedo.

9 MINERALIZATION 
TYPES OF MINERALIZATION 

Exploration work to date suggests that the uranium mineralization is stratabound and 

possibly syngenetic or diagenetic in origin.  Recent interpretation of exploration data 

suggests that areas of limonite+hematite alteration within the grey-green Massive Sand 

Unit and possibly the Wavy Unit, are equivalent units of the San Miguel Formation of the 

Southern UPC.  These sandstones have some characteristics similar to the alteration 

assemblages present at roll front-type uranium deposits of the Powder River Basin, 

Wyoming of the United States. 

 

Based on compilation of past exploration data and results of limited drilling by 

Crescent, the controls of uranium mineralization at Coronel Oviedo are as follows: 

 

• Carbonaceous material in the sandstones: uranium mineralization is best 
developed in the Massive Sand and Fine-grained Sand units.  Anschutz 
interpreted the tabular mineralized zones to be developed in the Massive 
Sand Unit, especially near the base of redox boundary in the eastern part of 
the concession.  Mineralization would be expected to be directly correlated 
with increased carbonaceous material in the Massive Sand Unit. 

 
• Structural controls: Fault-controlled mineralization is likely to have occurred, 

especially along the main north-northwest trending lineament.  Recent 
drilling by Crescent is focused on the interpreted trace of this lineament with 
the objective of intersecting significant uranium mineralization. 

 
• Redox fronts: The methodology of exploring for sandstone hosted uranium 

mineralization by Anschutz has been to identify redox fronts within the 
sandstone sequence of the Independencia Formation.  Whether roll front type 
or not, changes in the relative amount of alteration of pyrite in the sandstones 
are important guides to uranium mineralization in southeastern Paraguay.  
Figures 9-4 and 9-5 show the regional redox fronts as interpreted by 
Anschutz. 

 

The host rock that is mineralized in the Coronel Oviedo area is the basal unit of the 

Independencia Formation.  At least five mineralized zones are recognized.  These are: 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
9-2

• Top peak: Associated with the unit of Lower Grey Siltstone. 
 
• Upper Limb: Occurs in the upper and middle part of the sandstone. 
 
• Lower Limb: Occurs in the lower part of the sandstone. 
 
• Merged Zone: Where the Upper Limb and Lower Limb are joined. 
 
• Basal Peak: Occurs at the contact of the basal Ayala Formation with the LPC. 
 

An ideal roll front model of uranium mineralization includes an oxidized interior, 

with mineralization occurring at the oxidation/reduction interface, along the "tails" or 

limbs and in the nose of the roll, i.e., near the contact with the regionally reduced host 

(Figures 9-1 and 9-2, and Guilbert and Park, 1986).  The clay minerals within the 

sandstone sequence of the host rocks also show zoning, with montmorillonite at the top, 

clinoptilolite in the middle and analcite at the bottom of the sequence as evidence of 

progressive diagenetic zeolitization of the sandstones (de Voto, 1978).  Furthermore, 

there may be several generations of roll front-type uranium mineralization in a sandstone 

sequence, provided that the geochemical regime prevails for each unit (de Voto, 1978). 

 

The style of uranium mineralization at Coronel Oviedo shows some of characteristics 

associated with roll front-type deposits.  "There appears to be some increase in oxidation 

(increased limonite and deceased pyrite with an increase in brown-red-orange hues)" in 

the sandstones (Anschutz, 1981).  These features may indicate a variety of a roll front, 

whereby the diagenetic fluids would have travelled through the host sandstone and 

emplaced uranium at or near the redox front.  Additional ground investigations need to be 

carried out to assess the exploration potential of these anomalous areas.

TARGET AREAS 

Past exploration by Anschutz has discovered a number of targets with anomalous 

radioactivity and low grade uranium mineralization (Figure 9-3).  These are as follows: 

 

• Tres Corrales (Arroyo Tobatiry and Arroyo Tacuary) 

• Arroyo Aguapety 

• Santa Elena 

• Santa Catalina 

• Cuarto Potrero 

• Caacupé-Paraguarí 

• Cecilia Báez 

• Costa Chajha 

• Felipe Matiauda 

• Costa Pucu 

• Estero Tapiracuai 

• Itacurubi del Rosario 

 

Anschutz selected the above target areas based on the interpretation of drill results, 

such as an isopach map of the Massive Sand Unit and the base of the NUPC (Figures 9-4 

and 9-5).

TRES CORRALES AREA 
The Tres Corrales target area is located approximately 20 km northeast of Coronel 

Oviedo, adjacent to the village of Tres Corrales, covering a total area of approximately 25 

km2 in an agricultural region.  It includes the Arroyo Tobatiry and Arroyo Taguary 

targets (Figure 9-3).  The paved road (Ruta 2), from Asunción to Pte. Stroesner (via 

Caacupé and Coronel Oviedo), which becomes Ruta 7, passes through the southern part 

of the area (Figures 9-4, 9-5 and 9-6).  The sedimentary rocks in the area are gently east 

dipping rocks of Silurian age. 

 

Results of limited drilling in the past by Anschutz indicate that anomalous 

radioactivity in hematite-rich sandstone ranged from five to six times background 

response in drill holes RD-115, RD-116 and in 269-R-1.  Early results also indicated that: 

 
• The thickness of the glacial sediments is >400 m, and the slope of the 

unconformity between Silurian rocks and the Precambrian basement rocks is 
>10°.  Some parts of the glacial sediments show radiometric anomalies and some 
organic and/or pyrite-rich reduction zones (Chen, 1980). 

 
• The lowermost part of the Carly sandstone and the upper part of the Ayala 

sandstone are rich in hematite.  These hematite-rich sandstones occur in 
equivalent horizons some 50 km west of this area.  "From literature study the 
hematite rich sandstone of the equivalent horizon was also found in southwest 
Brazil, hundreds of kilometres away from the project area." (Chen, 1980) 

 
• The airborne and ground radiometric survey data, as well as chemical assay 

results and geologic features, show that there is an anomalous uranium zone more 
than 10 km long and several kilometres wide.  "The gamma-ray log from borehole 
data shows only three times background readings (140 cps) at the place where 
chemical assays show 182 ppm U3O8 and six times background readings (330 
cps) at 132 m depth in the hematite rich sandstone." (Chen, 1980) 

 
• The Vargas Peña sandstone was interpreted to be as much as 90 m thick. 
 
• At least four pairs of oxidation/reduction zones were detected within the drill 

holes completed, the boundaries of which were sharp. 
 
• The extensive distribution of uranium in the area indicates that significant 

concentrations of uranium may be present east of Itacurubí, especially at the

9-10

boundary between Silurian sandstones and the glacial sediments of the Coronel 
Oviedo Formation. 

 
Results of 1981and 1982 drilling also indicated that: 
 
• The potential for uranium mineralization in the Northern UPC is equal to (even 

exceeding) that of the Southern UPC. 
 
• Of the eight diamond drill holes completed by Anschutz, of which seven were in 

the Tres Corrales target area during the early 1980s, four holes encountered 
anomalous radioactivity at depths ranging from 30 m to 150 m.  One of these 
holes (272-T-14) intersected 0.153% U3O8 over 1.9 m at 150 m depth, and a 5 m 
thick radioactive anomaly at 67 m depth.  Another hole (251-T-7) intersected 
0.063% U3O8 over 30 cm (Reese, 1982). 

 
• Of the 26 rotary holes, 21 drilled into the UPC, and of these 21 holes 14 

encountered anomalous radioactivity.  One of these holes (272-T-3) intersected 
0.02% U3O8 over 3.9 m at 243 m depth, and 0.03% U3O8 over 0.6 m at 247 m 
depth. 

 
Based on the above results, Anschutz concluded that there are three primary targets 

within the Tres Corrales-Santa Cecilia target area.  These were: 

 
• The area near drill hole 272-T-3, where the thick anomalous zones were 

encountered in the favourable arkosic sandstone unit.  This hole is along Line 6 
across the major north-northwest trending lineament, which is shown in Figure 7-
3. 

 
• The area near drill hole 251-R-3, which encountered a thick radioactive 

anomalous near the basal UPC at approximately 70 m depth.  This hole is at the 
west end of Line 3 across the major north-northwest trending lineament, which is 
shown in Figure 7-3. 

 
• The two oxidation/reduction interfaces in the area on either side of the major 

north-northwest trending magnetic and topographic lineament (Figure 9-7).

CUARTO POTRERO 
This area is located approximately 20 km northeast of the town of Coronel Oviedo 

(Figure 9-3).  It is adjacent to the Arroyo Tobatiry target of the San José area (Line 6 in 

Figure 7-4).  Part of this area is included within the Tres Corrales target area.  Anschutz 

completed a number of holes in this area, of which two (drilled in 1982) returned 

encouraging results, as follows: 

 
• Drill hole 272-T-7 intersected 0.034% U3O8 over 3.3 m at 237.4 m and 0.040% 

U3O8 over 4.2 m at 248.1 m. 
 
• Drill hole 272-T-14 intersected 0.051% U3O8 over 0.6 m at 236.7 m and 0.153% 

U3O8 over 1.9 m at 248.1 m, including higher grade values of 0.302% U3O8 over 
0.7 m at 247.4 m and 0.464% U3O8 over 0.3 m at 247.4 m.  Figure 9-8 shows a 
stratigraphic cross section across the Cuatro Potrero area. 

 
Drill hole 272-T-16, drilled approximately 3.25 km north-northeast of hole 272-T-7 

area, encountered a reduced sand in the zone of mineralization, which indicated a general 

north-south redox interface in the 272 area (Reese, 1982c).

SANTA ELENA AREA 
The Santa Elena target area coincides with the town of Santa Elena, which is located 

approximately 35 km east of the town of Coronel Oviedo.  The area is underlain by 

sandstones of the Coronel Oviedo Formation.  Anschutz drilled three diamond drill holes 

(269-R-13, RD-116 and 269-R-4) situated approximately 2 km northeast and 3 km east of 

Santa Elena, respectively (Figures 9-4 and 9-9).  All three holes intersected similar 

lithologies.  From top to bottom these are: 

 
• Thick surface-weathered and oxidized zone up to 30 m thick. 
 
• Massive pebbly to conglomeratic sandstones, intercalated with finer grained and 

silty beds.  The coarser grained unit includes fragments of varying provenance, 
such as granitic rock, quartzite, sandstone, shale, chert and tuffaceous material.  
The unit is reduced, with grey to black colour, polymictic and very heterogeneous 
in size and content.  "Sedimentological features are diamictitic and are 
characteristic of the glacial deposits of the Carboniferous Coronel Oviedo 
Formation." (Wiens, 1981) 

 

Hole 269-R-13 contains, in the reduced section, abundant disseminated sulphides 

(pyrite) and marcasite nodules (0.5 cm), and a moderate amount of carbon flakes, which 

indicate a favourable environment for uranium mineralization.  The key correlation 

between these holes is the Silurian Vargas Peña shale, which underlies the diamictites 

(Wiens, 1981).  Figure 9-10 shows the Santa Elena target horizon as interpreted by 

Anschutz.

SANTA CATALINA 
The Santa Catalina target area coincides with the town of Santa Catalina, which is 

located approximately 40 km northeast of the town of Coronel Oviedo.  The area is 

underlain by sandstones of the Coronel Oviedo Formation.  Anschutz drilled four 

diamond drill holes across this zone.  From west to east these were 251-R-2, 251-T-6, 

251-T-7 and 252-T-3.  All four of these holes intersected significant radiometric 

anomalies that warrant further drill testing.  The stratigraphic cross section of this area 

indicates that radiometric response in down-hole probes increases to the east (Figure 9-

11). 

 

CAACUPÉ-PARAGUARÍ 
Three reconnaissance diamond drill holes completed in this area in 1981 encountered 

the Paraguarí basal Silurian conglomerate overlying Precambrian basement rocks.  

Weakly anomalous radiometric values are in the order of two times background 

responses.

10 EXPLORATION 
HISTORICAL EXPLORATION 

The following discussion is based on the exploration work by Anschutz during the 

late 1970s and early 1980s, and not by Crescent.  Recently, Crescent has carried out a 

compilation of all previous exploration data stored at Ministry of Public Works (MOPC) 

in Asunción. 

 

During the exploration programs by Anschutz, airborne radiometric surveys, regional 

geological mapping and geochemical sampling were the main exploration tools for 

uranium exploration in the southeastern part of Paraguay.  This was followed-up by core 

and rotary drilling, in two phases.  The initial phase was to drill wide spaced 

reconnaissance diamond drill holes along fences spaced approximately 16 km apart, 

complemented by Track-Etch survey (Rhyu, 1983).  The objective of this initial phase 

was to obtain stratigraphic information across an inferred host trend.  The second phase 

was to drill rotary holes, spaced approximately 0.5 km apart, within as well as in between 

the fences of the reconnaissance holes, to establish and outline target areas.  All drill 

holes were logged and probed by gamma, neutron and resistivity surveys.  From 1978 to 

1983, Anschutz completed more than 75,000 m of drilling. 

 

Exploration work by Anschutz has outlined two large target areas underlain by the 

UPC, as follows: 

 
• Primary Target Area: This contains the San Antonio, San Miguel, Typychaty and 

Yarati-í targets within the neighbouring Yuty Project area near and around the 
village of Yuty, approximately 200 km southeast of Asunción. 

 
• Other Targets of Interest: These targets include two areas situated northeast and 

north of the Town of Coronel Oviedo, approximately 150 km east of Asunción. 
 

Results of the regional Track Tech survey also detected north-northwest trending 

anomalous zone, which coincides with a similarly oriented magnetic and topographic

  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
10-2

lineament noted above.  This lineament extends from Cuarto Potrero where significant 

uranium mineralization has been discovered (Rhyu, 1983). 

 

The large target area extending from Tres Corrales to Cecilia Báez covers an area of 

approximately 100 km2 northeast and around the town of Coronel Oviedo.  Airborne and 

ground radiometric surveys, hydrogeochemical and lithogeochemical sampling, Track 

Etch survey and geological mapping have outlined an area with potential for uranium 

mineralization approximately 10 km long and 2 km wide in the San José area.  

Reconnaissance and local scale drilling results indicate a pronounced redox interface 

associated with uranium mineralization. 

 

Of the 60 rotary holes completed in 1981 and 1982, 21 drilled into the UPC, and 14 

holes encountered anomalous radioactivity in the Independencia Formation.  One of these 

holes (272-T-3) intersected 0.02% U3O8 over 3.9 m at 243 m depth, and 0.03% U3O8 

over 0.6 m at 247 m depth.  Figures 10-1 to 10-7 show the compilation of drill hole 

results by Anschutz, including regional cross sections at the Tres Corrales (Figure 10-5), 

Cecilio Baez (Figure 10-6) and Costa Chajha (Figure 10-7) target areas.  These results 

indicate: 

 
• A gentle slope for the top surface of the Massive Sand Unit, the bottom surface of 

the Massive Sand Unit of the UPC, and the top surface of the LPC, except for 
very steep slopes of these surfaces in the area between Hole 272-T-13 and 272-R-
2.  The eastern flank of the UPC is downthrown relative to the western flank, as 
shown in the cross sections of Figure 10-5.  Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion 
that this sharp slope coincides with the approximate location of the north-
northwest trending regional fault interpreted by Anschutz. 

 
• A similar structure to the one above between holes 251-T-9 and 251-R-1, as 

shown in Figure 10-6.  This structure may be present but the drill hole spacing is 
too wide to detect it accurately in this area. 

 

Based on regional exploration results as well as work done on specific target areas of 

the Northern UPC, Anschutz concluded that: 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
10-3

• The Silurian Independencia Formation is the most favourable host for uranium 
mineralization in Eastern Paraguay. 

 
• Roll front-type uranium mineralization is likely to be present within the Silurian 

Independencia Formation, because oxidation and reduced zones are readily 
detected in the sandstones, which are characteristic for roll front-type uranium 
deposits.

RECENT EXPLORATION 

Recently, Crescent has carried out a compilation of the previous Anschutz results and 

a program of reverse circulation drilling in the Tres Corrales target area.  The purpose of 

this work is to generate sufficient data which would allow an estimate of NI 43-101 

compliant mineral resource of the Tres Corrales target area.  All drill chips from the 

Crescent program are stored at the Coronel Oviedo site.  Statistics of work and results of 

drilling are discussed under Section 11, Drilling of this report. 

 

As part of the current exploration program, Crescent retained Mr. Robert A. 

Lunceford, Consulting Geologist, to carry out a review of past exploration results and 

provide guidance for the ongoing exploration program, based on e-logs of Anschutz 

holes.  Figures 10-1 to 10-4 show the redox front in the area based on preliminary results 

of Mr. Lunceford's compilation of the Anschutz data as outlined by Reese (1982).

11 DRILLING 
PREVIOUS DRILLING 

Approximately 15,775 m of drilling (core as well as rotary) was completed by 

Anschutz in previous campaigns from 1976 to 1982.  Only a small portion of the past 

drilling, however, was completed in land currently controlled by Crescent.  Results are 

discussed in earlier sections. 

 

Drilling contractors for diamond drilling were Geosol from Belo Horizonte and Bosio 

& Chase from Asunción, Paraguay.  NQ core was retrieved by both companies. 

 

Drilling contractors for rotary drilling were Chesapeake Drilling of Asunción and 

CPRM (a branch of the Brazilian Geological Survey) from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  In 

total, from 1979 to 1982 some 12,715 m of drilling was completed in 60 diamond drill 

holes.  Figure 11-1 shows the locations of the Anschutz drill holes and Table 25-1 

(Appendix B) shows the historical drilling by Anschutz within the current boundary of 

the Coronel Oviedo Property. 
 

The procedures used during the diamond and rotary drilling programs were drafted by 

Anschutz technical personnel (Carlson, 1981b) as follows: 

 
• The collar locations of all drill holes were marked on 1:200,000 regional scale 

maps as well as 1:50 000, 1:25,000 and 1:5,000 scale maps, based on a local grid 
by Anschutz crews. 

 
• A survey instrument was used to provide control information on the directional 

deviation (both azimuth and inclination) of each hole.  Although detailed 
information on hole deviations is not available, Scott Wilson RPA understands 
that hole deviations were minimal since most of the holes were short holes 
(Crescent, 2007). 

 
• Lithologic logging was done on drill core and rotary holes by company 

geologists, depicting all down-hole data including gamma, neutron and resistivity 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
11-2

logs, as well as equivalent uranium values.  All information was recorded on 
analog hand written logs.  The lithologic logs included marking: 

 
o Lithologic contacts 
o Descriptive geology 
o Intensity of various alteration types 
o Structural features, such as fractured zones 

 

Scott Wilson RPA reviewed a number of drill logs at the MOPC in Asunción.  Scott 

Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the lithologic logging procedures are comparable to 

industry standards.

RECENT DRILLING 

During the 2007 field season, Crescent completed 7,615 m of drilling in 11 RC and 

17 rotary drill holes in the Tres Corrales target area.  Drilling was carried out from 

August 15 to December 14, 2007.  The goal of the 2007 drill program was to confirm the 

previous results and the uranium mineralization at Tres Corrales as documented in the 

historic Anschutz drilling.  Thirteen of the 28 holes were located close (within 15 m to 50 

m) to the old Anschutz holes.  Five of the 28 holes were abandoned due to excessive 

formational water.  Although these holes are not considered as "twins" of the Anschutz 

holes, they are considered to represent the same area of mineralization, in Scott Wilson 

RPA's opinion (Figure 11-1). 

 

Drilling contractors were Northwest Atlantic Drilling (Northwest) from Argentina, 

which is operating in Paraguay through its subsidiary Compañia Paraguaya de Minería 

(COPAMI), and 9 de Junio from Paraguay.  The procedures used during the RCD 

programs were as follows: 

 
• The collar locations of all drill holes were surveyed and marked in the field.  A 

Geographic Positioning System (GPS) instrument was used to mark the collar 
locations of both old Anschutz drill holes as well as the new Crescent drill holes.  
This survey was carried out by Mr. Carlos Figuerero of Seminsa. 

 
• Lithologic logging of drill core and geotechnical observations were provided by 

Messrs Miguel Cabello, Esteban Sanabria, Albino Roman and Carlos Lopez, all 
of whom are contract geologists for Seminsa.  Logging is done by depicting all 
down-hole data including radiometric values, and subsequently assay values.  All 
information is recorded on previously prepared logs.  This includes marking: 

 
o Lithologic contacts; 
o Descriptive geology; 
o Intensity of various alteration types; 
o Structural features, such as fracture and brecciated zones; 
o Maintaining a photographic record of the core with a digital camera.  

Photographs are taken of all exploration drill core and key information is 
summarized in a digital database. 

 
• Downhole radiometric logging was done by Messrs Luis Dominguez (Geologist) 

and Carlos Sugastti (Technician).  A Mount Sopris Instrument Co., Inc. ((MGX II 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com

model and Matrix digital logger S/N 0713) is used for this purpose.  Each logging 
unit is equipped with one Poly Gamma Probe, type 2PGA-1000, S/N 3842 that 
can record in one run the gamma ray intensity (Gamma) in cps.  A detailed 
description of radiometric logging methods is discussed below. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that drill core logging procedures used by 

Crescent are in keeping with industry standards.  Scott Wilson RPA, however, 

recommends that down-hole survey also be used to obtain data that would provide 

geographic coordinates of the mineralized intersections, which would be used to estimate 

mineral resources.  Results of recent drilling are summarized in Table 11-1, and the collar 

locations of the recent drill holes are shown in Figure 11-1. 

 

In general, results of recent drilling indicate that eight zones of anomalous 

radioactivity occur within the NUPC of the Coronel Oviedo Property.  Only two of them, 

however, show good continuity along strike.  These are as follows: 

 
• Zone 1: 0.30 m to 1 m thick, occurs 137 m to 153 m below the surface.

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
PREVIOUS WORK 

Detailed information on sampling method and approach during the Anschutz drilling 

campaigns is not available.  Nevertheless, Scott Wilson RPA understands that sampling 

procedures were comparable to Western industry standards of that time.  These included: 

 
• Sampling of the whole core of diamond drill holes, with sample intervals of 

approximately 30 cm (1 ft.). 
 
• Description of the rotary drill chips at 5 ft. or 10 ft. intervals. 
 
• Calculation of equivalent uranium grades from radiometric (gamma) logs. 
 

RECENT WORK 

The methodology of sampling of the RC drill cuttings during the 2007 drilling 

program by Crescent is as follows: 

 
• Drill cuttings are collected from a hose, except the first two metres of each hole, 

which is collected by placing splitter pans next to the collar.  A five-gallon drum 
is placed close to the end of the hose to collect the cuttings as they emerge from 
the hose.  Samples are collected at two-metre intervals.  One-metre intervals are 
marked on the drill pipe with chalk by the drillers and the exact length (in metres) 
is verified several times as the hole is drilled. 

 
• Drill chips are sampled for the portion of the holes from approximately 150 m to 

250 m below the surface, because this interval of the sandstone is the general host 
of the uranium mineralization in the area.  For reference purpose, however, a 
representative chip sample is collected at two-metre intervals down the hole and 
sorted in plastic chip trays. 

 
• All drill cuttings for each two-metre interval are passed through a three-way 

stainless steel splitter with fixed one-inch chutes.  The splitter consists of three 
one-way splitters mounted in a steel frame, with two splitters directed to the back 
and the third directed to the front.  All material is collected in large metal pans; 
only a small fraction is not caught, and this material is not added to the samples.  
After all material from a two-metre interval is collected, the frame of the splitter 
assembly is rapped with a rubber mallet to dislodge loose material.  The splitter is

  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
12-2

kept dry at all times and brushed clean when necessary.  If damp or wet cuttings 
are left in the buckets, these are split by hand.  A typical one-metre interval yields 
20 kg to 30 kg of dry cuttings.  Scott Wilson RPA notes, however, that use of the 
three-way splitter was abandoned due to the lack of sufficient sample material, 
and virtually all the samples, wet or dry, were passed through the cyclone.  In rare 
cases only, when no water was added or formational water was not encountered, 
the three-way splitter was used. 

 
• All or part of the material exiting from the single splitter (25% by volume) is 

retained for analysis.  The cuttings are mixed in the collection pan by running a 
hand back and fourth several times and emptied into several 8 in. by 12 in. heavy 
plastic polyethylene bags.  Excess material from the pan is added to the other 
pans. 

 

• Depending on sample depth in the hole, material not saved in plastic bags is 
either: 

• Dumped in piles near the drill hole, or  

• Poured into large rice bags and stored. 

 
• Based on previous drilling, the depth and thickness of the ore zone is known 

which is from 150 m to 250 m below the surface.  Above the mineralized zone, 
two plastic bags, each containing 1 kg to 1.5 kg of material, are collected.  One 
bag is retained for analysis, and the other is placed in placed in large rice bags for 
storage and for backup.  The rice bags are wired closed and placed in storage. 

 
• If all or part of a one-metre interval is damp from water added to stabilize the 

hole, the sample buckets are placed next to the appropriate excess material or rice 
bags at the drill site and left to dry for several days.  Clear water is decanted from 
the buckets and sampled separately every few hours.  Intervals that contain 
buckets of very wet material, with or without a fraction of dry cuttings, are split 
by dumping all cuttings into a 30 gal. plastic tub.  Enough water is added to turn 
the material into slurry, and the cuttings are thoroughly mixed with a shovel.  
From this mixture, a single 5-gal. bucket is retained, dried, and split by hand to 
plastic bags.  The remainder of the material from the bucket is discarded or stored 
in a rice bag, depending on depth. 

 
• Various measurements are obtained on the samples at the drill site, as described 

below. 
 

• For each one-metre interval, two cups of cuttings are passed through a 12-
mesh spaghetti strainer.  The percentage of plus 12-mesh material remaining 
is estimated by pouring it back into the measuring cup and recording the 
amount to 10% (by volume). 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
12-3

• A fraction of the plus 12-mesh material is mounted on chipboard for future 
logging. 

 
• Recovery above the mineralized zone is estimated visually by examining the 

amount of excess material dumped in piles on the ground. 
 

• Recovery just above the mineralized zone through the bottom of the hole is 
measured by weighing the rice bags for each sample interval. 

 
• Recovery for intervals containing abundant water can not be measured; rather, 

the gallons or litres of muddy material are recorded.  In general, however, this 
was difficult to do due to the heavy water flow at depths from 170 m to 240 
m. 

 

The above methodology of sampling was followed as much as possible during the 

recent drilling program.  Due to difficulties encountered in drilling, however, only partial 

samples of the one-metre or two-metre intervals have been collected by the Seminsa 

crew.

The principles of radioactive disintegration, radiometric logging and calibration 

methodologies are discussed in Appendix A.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND 
APPROACH 
PREVIOUS WORK 

Sample preparation, assaying, and quality assurance-quality control (QA/QC) 

procedures used by Anschutz are not available to Scott Wilson RPA.  Scott Wilson RPA 

understands that the procedures used during the exploration and production phase of the 

Yuty Project were similar to industry standards at the time (Crescent, 2007). 

 

RECENT WORK 

Sampling of drill chips was planned to be done at two-metre intervals.  Samples were 

planned to be sent to ALS Chemex Sample Preparation Laboratory (ALS Chemex), in 

San Jose Argentina, where sample preparation would be carried out.  Thereafter, samples 

would be sent to Energy Labs in Casper, Wyoming, for uranium assays by the Closed 

Can method.  Details of the Energy Labs analytical method are provided in Appendix C.  

Due to the difficulties encountered during drilling, and the poor recovery of drill chips, 

however, samples have not been sent to the lab.

14 DATA VERIFICATION 
PREVIOUS WORK 

During the early exploration in the area by Anschutz, data verification was done by 

company geologists.  Data on QA/QC procedures, however, are not available.  Scott 

Wilson RPA has not verified the old Anschutz database, because this is being done by 

Crescent.  Scott Wilson RPA understands that the past drill hole data were verified by 

Anschutz, to the extent as discussed under the previous section of Sampling Method and 

Approach.  In terms of recording field data, Anschutz had established detailed procedures 

for technical staff (Carlson, 1981a and 1980). 

 

As a check of its calculated equivalent uranium grades, Anschutz sent 29 samples of 

pulp from core hole 372-T-60 from the neighbouring Yuty Project area, which was 

assayed at Geosol Laboratories, and to Skyline Laboratories.  Scott Wilson RPA 

understands that results were comparable, but details are not available at this time.  Scott 

Wilson RPA also understands that at least one core sample from drill hole 272-T-14 

(245.5 m to 247.7 4 m) was sent to Hazen Research, as further check of the calculated 

uranium grades.  Results for this 1.9 m interval indicate 0.134% U3O8 by the Fluorimetric 

method and 0.112% U3O8 by the Closed Can method (Crescent, 2007). 

 

RECENT WORK 

During the recent confirmation drilling campaign, data verification and quality 

control was done by Seminsa and contract personnel.  The quality and reliability of the 

data obtained from the recent drilling program was reviewed and verified by Messrs 

Robert A. Lunceford, Consulting Geologist, and Carlos Figuerero, Chief Geologist of 

Seminsa in charge of the drilling program, and under the supervision of Dr. Bernie D. 

Schmeling.  Scott Wilson RPA understands that Messrs Schmeling and Lunceford are 

Qualified Persons under the definition of National Instrument 43-101.

ASSAY QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
The QA/QC procedures and assay protocols followed by Anschutz in the past are not 

available to Scott Wilson RPA.  QA/QC procedures used by Crescent for the recent RC 

drill chip samples at Tres Corrales have been reviewed by Scott Wilson RPA.  Even 

though no sampling has yet been carried out, these procedures are as follows: 

 
• Samples are handled only by Buscore contract geologists.  Samples are sent by 

Mr. Bart Wilson, Partner and Regional Manager for Buscore directly to the ALS 
Chemex sample preparation laboratory in San Jose, Argentina.  The method of 
delivery is by air freight. 

 
• Drill chips are sampled for the portion of the holes from approximately 150 m to 

250 m below the surface, because this interval of the sandstone is the general host 
of the uranium mineralization in the area.  For reference purpose, however, a 
representative chip sample is collected at 2-m intervals down the hole and sorted 
in plastic chip trays. 

 
• Drill chips are brought by authorized exploration personnel one or more times per 

shift from the drill rig directly to a drill logging and sampling area within the 
Coronel Oviedo Property.  Within 48 hours, the material intervals are 
photographed, logged and sampled, and the samples are shipped directly to the 
sample preparation laboratory. 

 
• Each sample is assigned a unique sample number that allows it to be traced 

through the sampling and analytical procedures, for validation against the original 
sample site.  The remaining chips are stored at the Coronel Oviedo site, available 
for review and resampling, if required. 

 
• Blanks and standards are inserted after every ten (10) samples.  Two types of 

standards are used.  These were acquired from the Saskatchewan Research 
Council (SRC) laboratory, and the blanks are collected from the diabase sill 
overlying the mineralized units at the neighbouring Yuty Property, with expected 
nil uranium values. 

 
When samples become available, sample preparation will be carried out at the ALS 

Chemex sample preparation laboratory in San Jose, Argentina, and assays are carried out 

at the Energy Labs in Casper, Wyoming (Appendix C).  Scott Wilson RPA notes that the 

procedures used at the ALS Chemex sample preparation laboratory, and at Energy Labs, 

including the reagents and apparatus used for the assays, are similar to those used at 

many commercial laboratories in Canada.  In particular, they include:

• Crushing the split sample to 10 mesh and grinding it to 150 mesh. 
 
• Cleaning the pulverizer after each sample using cleaner sand to avoid cross 

contamination of samples. 
 
• Uranium determinations are carried out using the Closed Can method. 
 

CHECK ASSAYS 
There are no data indicating that a check assay program was in effect regarding the 

drilling done by Anschutz from 1979 to 1982 on the Coronel Oviedo Property. 

 

Due to the difficulties encountered during the 2007 confirmation drilling program by 

Crescent, check assays and QA/QC procedures were not carried out either at the Coronel 

Oviedo Project site or at ALS Chemex sample preparation laboratory and at Energy Labs. 

 

INDEPENDENT SAMPLING BY SCOTT WILSON RPA 

2006 INDEPENDENT SAMPLING 
During the first site visit on July 10, 2007, Scott Wilson RPA reviewed the Anschutz 

exploration results and the methodology of lithologic and radiometric logging of drill 

holes by Anschutz crews.  Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the field practices 

used by Anschutz crews were in keeping with industry standards. 

 

As a check of previous results, Scott Wilson RPA collected eight independent 

samples, four from each of diamond drill holes 272-T-14 and 272-T-R2 of the Tres 

Corrales target area, and sent them to SGS Laboratories, Don Mills, Ontario (SGS), for 

independent assays.  The uranium determinations were done at the Becquerel 

Laboratories, Hamilton, Ontario, on behalf of SGS, using the Neutron Activation 

Analysis (NAA) method.  Anschutz had not sampled these holes.  Results indicate that 

the uranium grade in these two holes ranges from 0.6 ppm U to 7.4 ppm U, with an 

average value of 2.63 ppm U (Table 14-1).  Details of the sample preparation and 

analytical methods used at Becquerel laboratories are provided in Appendix C.

As part of our verification of field data, Scott Wilson RPA attempted to verify the 

locations of past drill holes and surficial features of the Tres Corrales target area, but was 

unsuccessful due to the lack of hole markings.  During the second site visit, Scott Wilson 

RPA verified the locations of six old holes and one new hole as shown in Table 14-2.

18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND 
INFORMATION 

The principal commodity for the Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project is uranium.  Scott 

Wilson RPA notes that the market for uranium has improved considerably during the past 

30 months, from a low of approximately US$9/lb U3O8 to more than US$135.00/lb U3O8 

for the spot price of uranium.  Recently, however, the price of uranium has been in the 

order of US$90/lb U3O8   Because of this significant increase in the price of uranium, 

many Canadian junior mining companies have initiated uranium exploration programs in 

various parts of the World. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA understands that, in its effort to promote and increase foreign 

investment related to mining projects in the country, the Paraguayan Government has 

indicated that it will facilitate the approval process, in terms of permits, for Transandes 

S.A., which is currently the title holder of the Coronel Oviedo Project (Fialayre, 2007).

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
EXPLORATION POTENTIAL 

In general, the Coronel Oviedo Uranium Project is at an early stage of exploration.  

The Tres Corrales area, however, has received certain amount of drilling and is at an 

intermediate stage of exploration.  A number of areas of anomalous concentrations in 

uranium occur in Upper Permian to Carboniferous sedimentary rocks within the project 

land.  Past work was focused on developing roll front-type targets.  Preliminary 

interpretation of drill results in the Tres Corrales area suggests that the basal sandstone 

unit (Providencia Formation) is the favourable host for uranium mineralization. 

 

There are other areas with potential for uranium mineralization within the portion of 

the Coronel Oviedo Project area.  Scott Wilson RPA notes that these areas warrant 

further exploration. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

Based on our review of technical reports on past exploration and publications, Scott 

Wilson RPA concludes that: 

 
• The Coronel Oviedo Project area is underlain by Upper Permian to Carboniferous 

(UPC) continental, deltaic and marine sandstones of the Paraná basin, which hosts 
the Figueira uranium deposit in Brazil and includes a number of uranium 
occurrences in eastern Paraguay. 

 
• Twelve areas of uranium anomalies, with uranium content in the samples ranging 

from 0.033% eU3O8 to 0.153% eU3O8 (equivalent U3O8) are associated with units 
of subhorizontal sandstones.  The anomalous zones range from 30 cm to 5 m 
intersections of the sandstones situated from 30 m to 250 m below the surface. 

 
• Of the eight diamond drill holes completed by Anschutz, of which seven were in 

the Tres Corrales target area during the early 1980s, four holes encountered 
anomalous radioactivity at depths ranging from 30 m to 150 m.  One of these 
holes (272-T-14) intersected 0.153% U3O8 over 1.9 m at 150 m depth, and a 5 m

  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
19-2

thick radioactive anomaly at 67 m depth.  Another hole (251-T-7) intersected 
0.063% U3O8 over 30 cm. 

 
• Twenty-one of the 26 rotary holes were drilled by Anschutz into the UPC 

sandstones, and of these 21 holes 14 encountered anomalous radioactivity.  One 
of these holes (272-T-3) intersected 0.02% U3O8 over 3.9 m at 243 m depth, and 
0.03% U3O8 over 0.6 m at 247 m depth. 

 
• Of the 28 recent drill holes completed by Crescent in the Tres Corrales target 

area, eleven intersected significant uranium mineralization of ≥0.03% eU3O8 over 
intervals ranging from 0.3 m to 5.58 m.  The average thickness of these intercepts 
was 3.06 m with an average grade of 0.041% eU3O8, and an equivalent grade x 
thickness (eGT) value of 0.129. 

 
• Past and recent exploration has established some favourable criteria suggesting 

the possibility of sizeable uranium accumulations within the Coronel Oviedo 
Property.  These criteria are: 

o Radiometric anomalies detected from airborne radiometric surveys. 
o Occurrence of wide areas of Permo-Carboniferous sandstones. 
o Major north-northwest trending regional structure. 

 
• The style of uranium mineralization is that of sandstone-hosted uranium 

mineralization.  Sandstone-type deposits are characteristically sedimentary 
formations of clastic-detrital origin containing reducing environments.  These 
deposits are usually tabular in shape and may occur in continental sandstones, 
deltaic or shallow marine environments. 

 
• Exploration data suggest that the likely environments of uranium mineralization 

are a coastal plain depositional system and a deltaic environment with fine-
grained sands containing some organic material, which could serve as reductant 
for the precipitation of uranium. 

 
• In general, the drill core samples collected by Scott Wilson RPA contain low 

grade uranium mineralization.  These values range from 0.6 ppm U to 7.4 ppm U.  
The drill core, however, was not assayed by Anschutz, and it is uncertain as to 
whether the sampled interval coincides directly with zones of mineralization 
identified from downhole logging. 

 
• In general, the exploration work and lithologic and radiometric logging 

procedures by Crescent are in keeping with industry standards. 
 
• There is good potential for the discovery of additional uranium mineralization 

within the Coronel Oviedo mineral licence and further work is warranted.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 
Scott Wilson RPA recommends that Crescent continue with the reverse circulation 

drilling at Tres Corrales, as well as the regional exploration program.  The objective of 

this work is to discover uranium mineralization similar to known sandstone-hosted 

uranium deposits.  The recommended work would consist of: 

 
• A program of core drilling, which would allow estimation of mineral resources. 
 
• Continuation of the regional exploration program, involving additional drilling, to 

assess the exploration potential for uranium mineralization within the vast 
Coronel Oviedo mineral concession in southeastern Paraguay. 

 
• Metallurgical testing to assess the recovery of uranium in the sandstones by in-

situ leaching or by underground mining methods. 
 

Crescent has prepared a preliminary budget for 2008 in the order of US$3.6 million 

(Table 20-1).  This includes 20,000 m of rotary and diamond core drilling in Tres 

Corrales area followed by the preparation of a mineral resource estimate.  Scott Wilson 

RPA concurs with this program and budget.

INTRODUCTION 
Radiometric logging is commonly used in uranium exploration, and is accepted as a 

reliable tool in the evaluation of uranium deposits.  The following is a discussion on the 

different methods of radiometric logging of drill holes, including calibration of logging 

instruments, and is taken from a report by Plouffe et al (1982) and from Schmeling 

(1982). 

 

Natural radioactivity occurs in a wide variety of geological environments.  It consists 

primarily of the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium and potassium.  The 

concentrations of these elements may range from weak disseminations in soils and rocks, 

such as in black shales, to high grade concentrations, such as in unconformity related 

mineralization or in pegmatitic veins. 

 

Radiometric logging results are qualitative by nature; they exhibit the relative amount 

of radioactivity in the drill hole that is being probed.  They may, however, be calibrated 

to provide an acceptable results in terms of the uranium content in the rocks.  At all 

times, the radioactive response is an expression of the equilibrium state of the contained 

uranium and its daughter products, which are also radioactive. 

 

Radiometric logging techniques of drill holes are of two types; passive and active.  

Passive techniques measure natural radiation with detectors, such as gross-gamma-ray 

counters or gamma-ray spectral analyzers.  The active techniques use a radioactive source 

and measure the net effect on the radiation of the surrounding rocks.  The radiation which 

reaches the detector(s) can be expressed in different parameters, such as density, porosity, 

moisture content etc.  The effective radius of investigation for these techniques is 

inversely proportional to the square (or even cubed) distance of the source of radiation.  

The radiation is mostly attenuated by the density of surrounding rock, and other material, 

such as water and rods, between the source and the detector.  Therefore, approximately 

95% of the gamma rays come from within a 30 cm radius of the detector.  This indicates 

that the volume of material being investigated by down-hole radiometric logging to be an 

order of magnitude greater that the core sample.  This also indicates that the radiometric

data are much more representative of the material which is being drilled, especially in 

porous or friable rock with poor core recovery. 

 

BASIC PRINCIPLES OF RADIOACTIVITY 
DISINTEGRATION AND RADIOACTIVITY 

Radioactivity is the process whereby some elements with high atomic numbers, 

which are unstable, emit alpha (α) and beta (β) particles from their nuclei, and 

electromagnetic energy as a natural process of disintegration.  Alpha particles are 

positively charged helium particles and beta particles are negatively charged electrons.  

This disintegration can be accompanied by the release of electromagnetic energy in the 

form of gamma rays (γ) which, unlike alpha or beta particles, does not have mass nor is it 

charged positively or negatively.  The gamma rays are comprised of bundles or photons 

of electromagnetic energy, and are one of the most penetrating types of radiation.  That is 

why during field logging and measurements of natural radioactivity, detection of gamma 

rays is the most commonly used method. 

 

During disintegration, the original radioactive element forms a new isotope (daughter 

product) which may or may not be stable, as shown in the radioactive decay series of 

Figure 24-1.  The radioactivity is natural when disintegration occurs spontaneously, or it 

is induced when it results from the bombardment of an existing nuclide.  The rate of 

disintegration is characteristic and unique for each radioactive nuclide.  Although 

disintegration is independent and random, a constant percentage of the atoms will 

disintegrate over time.  This relationship is expressed as an exponential function as: 

 

Nt = N0e-λt 

Where N0 is the number of radioactive atoms of one nuclide at time zero, Nt is the 

number of atoms at time (t) and λ is the decay constant, which is unique for each 

radioactive nuclide and is directly proportional to the radioactive intensity of that 

particular nuclide. 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
24-4

The time required for the disintegration of one half of the atoms (half-life) is 

expressed as: 

 

T½ = ln(2) / λ 

 

Where λ is the decay constant and ln(2) is the natural logarithm of 2.  Since the half-

life is a function of the decay constant (λ), it is a unique property of each radioactive 

element.  This property is unaffected by physical or chemical changes during geological 

processes.

The radioactive decay series from uranium-238, uranium-235 and thorium-232 (after Rosholt, 1959).
In gamma-ray logging, gamma-rays emitted by the various daughter products in these decay series are
detected, counted and displayed as a function of depth in boreholes. Information about these daughters,
their relative location in the decay scheme, their half-lives and their gamma-ray energies and relative
intensities is required for a complete interpretation of a modern gamma-ray log.

RADIOACTIVE EQUILIBRIUM 
Heavy, long-lived radioactive elements, such as U238 decay naturally, producing a 

series of daughter products, and end up as a stable element, such as lead (Pb206) as shown 

in Figure 1.  Since the members of the decay series are different chemical elements, they 

may be selectively separated from the original element (parent isotope) by geochemical 

processes.  Radioactive equilibrium is attained when all the daughter products 

disintegrate at the same rate as they are produced by the parent isotopes and all nuclides 

remain together.  In nature, however, this almost never occurs, as explained below. 

 

Since long-lived nuclides disintegrate at a slower rate than short-lived ones, it is 

necessary to have more of the slower disintegrating daughters in order to have 

equilibrium.  An ideal state of equilibrium, however, is never attained because the parent 

isotopes are subject to decay without replacement.  But if the decay constant of the parent 

is small (the half-life is large) a state of relative or "secular" equilibrium may be attained.  

Since most detection methods do not measure the parent material, the amount (or 

quantity) of the parent material is inferred by measuring the radiation from the daughter 

products.  It is important to determine the state of "secular" equilibrium when one 

estimates the amount of uranium from gamma ray logs.  The main sources of the gamma 

energy from the U238 decay series are the daughter products Pb214 and Bi214. 

 

Radioactive disequilibrium happens if one or more of the daughter products, or the 

parent isotope, is completely or partially absent.  The various disequilibrium states may 

be caused by the following: 

 
• Radon; the gaseous member of the uranium series, is easily separated from the 

rest of the elements in the decay series.  Since some of the elements which emit 
radioactivity are produced after the occurrence of radon, a disequilibrium results 
which will negatively bias the inferred quantity of the parent U238. 

 
• Recent deposition of parent material either by initial deposition or by 

remobilization, i.e. little or no daughter products.  This will also cause an 
underestimation of the quantity of the parent material. 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
24-7

• Estimation of parent material based on measurements on remobilized daughter 
products, with little or no parent material present.  This will result in an 
overestimation of the parent material. 

 
It is important to note that sometimes disequilibrium may be masked by higher 

emissions of gamma rays from the daughter products of the Thorium series, especially 

Th208. 

 

When there is disequilibrium in the uranium series, and when the absent nuclides are 

short-lived, approximately 350,000 years are required for the uranium series to regain 

equilibrium.  Normally, if the series is disturbed at the beginning of the chain, then it can 

take up to 2.5 million years to regain equilibrium.  To calculate the time required to 

regain equilibrium, one considers the longest half-life of the daughters which have been 

mobilized and multiply it by 10.  For example, if radon is lost, the time to regain 

equilibrium is 3.8 days x 10, or approximately one month.  For the long lived U234, with a 

half-life of 2.5 x 105, the time to regain equilibrium is 2.5 x 105 x 10, or 2.5 million years. 

 
DETECTORS FOR GAMMA RADIATION 

All radiometric measuring systems convert the gamma-ray energy into an electrical 

signal.  The most commonly used types of detectors are Geiger-Mueller counters and 

scintillation counters, or scintillometers.  The efficiency of the detector depends on the 

energy of the incident radiation, the crystal used to detect radiation, and the detector's 

dimensions.  The efficiency is defined as the ratio of the number of pulses produced by a 

source to the number of pulses recorder by the detector. 

 
GEIGER-MUELLER COUNTER 

The basic principle of the Geiger-Mueller counter is the ionization of the gases in the 

detector tube caused by the influx of the gamma rays.  This ionization completes a circuit 

between the two charged poles inside the tube, producing a pulse.  The number of these 

pulses is counted over unit time, e.g. counts per second or cps.  The maximum count rate 

is limited by the recovery time of the detector, i.e. the time required for the gases in the 

tube to de-ionize, which limits the maximum uranium grade measured by the detector.  



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
24-8

Because of these limitations the efficiency of this type of detector is relatively low (<1%) 

for low grade mineralization, but increases with higher gamma ray energies (Figure 24-

2).  Furthermore, the Geiger-Mueller counter cannot distinguish between the different 

energy levels produced by the decay of uranium and thorium.

SCINTILLOMETER AND SPECTROMETER 
Scintillometers and spectrometers use certain crystals (thallium activated NaI) to 

record radioactivity.  In these types of crystals the ionizing radiation produces a ray of 

light or scintillation (fluorescence).  The scintillation is registered by the photosensitive 

cathode of an attached photomultiplier tube, which emits electrons.  These electrons are 

directed through a series of electrodes to amplify the signal.  This signal is proportional to 

the intensity of the scintillation, which in turn is proportional to the energy released by 

the source material.  For common use, as in total count measurements, the scintillometers 

integrates al pulses above a certain energy level. 

 

A spectrometer uses a frequency distribution of the various energy levels of the 

source by analyzing the different energy levels.  It does not measure the true spectrum of 

radiation, but it indicates the pulse distribution of the energies, calibrated in terms of 

gamma ray energies. 

 

PASSIVE RADIOMETRIC DOWNHOLE LOGGING 
GROSS-GAMMA LOGGING 

Scintillation and Geiger-Mueller counters are the most widely applied logging tools 

in the routine search and evaluation of radioactive minerals.  Both types of detectors 

measure the whole intensity range (gross-gamma) of the total natural gamma radiation, 

emitted by the uranium and thorium decay series and potassium 40 (K40).  Accurate 

gross-gamma readings rely on the sensitivity of the detector, which is dependent on 

detector dead time, geometry and size, and logging speed.  If there are two or more 

random pulses spaced close together in time, and the resolving (dead time) of the detector 

is slow, then only one pulse may be measured.  Since dead time is a non-linear function 

and depends on the intensity level of the radiation measured, a correction to the data must 

be made if quantitative results are needed.  The dead time is specific to each detector and 

is normally very small or negligible for scintillometers, but may reach 100 microseconds 

or more for some Geiger-Mueller counters. 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
24-11

In some logging systems, the dead time is automatically corrected with modifications 

to the internal electronics.  The recorded readings of the systems, which are not dead time 

corrected, are normally adjusted by using the formula: 

 

N = n / (1 – nt) 

Where 

 N is the corrected or true count rate 

 n is the apparent count rate recorded 

 t is detector dead time in seconds 

 

The sensitivity of each detector determines the precision of the results over the entire 

range of natural gamma radiation intensities between normal background and high grade 

concentrations.  Therefore, prior to logging care must be taken in choosing the type of 

detector with the most sensitive response in each intensity range.  The sensitivity of the 

scintillation counter depends on the size and geometry of the crystal, as noted above.  To 

detect low grade uranium mineralization, the detector should have a large size crystal, 

whereas, for high grade uranium concentrations the crystal should be small, but thick 

enough to generate scintillations of lower energy gamma rays.  Of course, the size of the 

crystal inside the logging probe is limited to the diameter of the probe, which in turn is 

dependent on the diameter of the hole. 

 

The use of Geiger-Mueller counters is limited in detecting radioactivity in high grade 

uranium deposits mainly because of the decreasing precision caused by their large 

resolving time.  For scintillometers used in high grade deposits, electronic and/or 

shielding filters – commonly made of sleeves of lead, cadmium, copper and/or brass – are 

used to detect a linear response over a wide range of intensities.  Shielding, on the other 

hand, does not solve the non-linear response of Geiger-Mueller counters. 

 

The logging speed in analog equipment (as opposed to digital) affects the sensitivity 

of the system and is dependent on the thickness and intensity of a radioactive layer.  



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
24-12

Therefore, the logging speed in drill holes with rapid changes of intensities and thin 

interlayered units should be adjusted to the resolving time and the sensitivity of the entire 

logging system. 

 

When logging high grade uranium deposits with associated heavy elements, 

scintillometers and Geiger-Mueller counters are affected by the self-shielding of the same 

elements (Z effect or Zeff).  This is the absorption caused by the photo-electric effect.  A 

correction for this relative decrease in the readings can be made by the proper calibration 

of the equipment using high grade standards of known concentration and high specific 

gravity.  A similar correction also can be made by measuring the low and high energy 

gamma rays, as the uranium in the high grade sample will release relatively more low-

energy rays and shield the higher energy gamma rays. 

 

Finally, thermal protection for the scintillometers is required in abnormally hot or 

cold conditions, because the crystals in the scintillometers may become unreliable.  

Geiger-Mueller counters are less affected by hot or cold temperatures. 

 
CALIBRATION OF GROSS-GAMMA LOGGING EQUIPMENT 

To convert radiometric logging measurements into accurate quantitative data, it is 

necessary to calibrate the recording system and to carry out a technical check of the 

logging system and operational tests.  The technical check is done to ensure the proper 

operation of the mechanical and electronic functions of the logging system.  Regular 

recording of these checks provides data on the status of the equipment and any changes in 

the stability of the equipment.  A logging system should be designed to operate with the 

same precision under all kinds of conditions.  It follows that operational tests and 

calibrations should be done under normal (laboratory) and field conditions.  There are 

two types of calibrations methods which can be used.  These are: 

 
• The most common method is to dig a test pit or a big hole, with pre-determined 

parameters, simulating the drill holes in a mineralized area.  In these holes, the 
grade of the mineralization, grade x thickness value, density, hole size and hole 
conditions are known and, therefore, correction factors for non-standard 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
24-13

conditions can be derived.  Usually, to cover a range of grade concentrations, a 
number of test holes are logged.  This provides the relationship between 
instrument readings and equivalent grade concentrations to be established.  It is 
important to note that correction factors derived by logging inside specially 
designed holes are based on "ideal" conditions, simulating the environment and 
style of mineralization of the area which is being investigated.  Also, correction 
factors are best suited for logging equipment used for uranium deposits with 
generally homogeneous grade concentrations, i.e. usually low grade uranium 
deposits. 

 
• The other, less frequently employed uses cored drill holes (model holes) with 

parameters carefully established by analyzing the core samples for their mineral 
content, density, and the chemical assay grade.  Since the specific drill hole 
conditions (size, casing and hole filling) are known, these undisturbed holes are 
used as "calibration source".  The direct, statistical comparison of the chemically 
analyzed grade and the radiometric log readings over identical intersections, can 
lead to correction factors applicable to similar drill holes. 

 
In either of the two calibration methods the correction factors are dependent on: 
 
• The radius of the effective volume surrounding the detector, which in turn 

depends on the primary energy of the radiation emitted within the sample volume. 
 
• The density of the rock surrounding the probe, which affects the linear absorption 

of radiation. 
 
• The mineral constituents (of the mineralized layer) including the self-shielding 

effect of any material. 
 
• The proper design of the probe.  This includes the thickness and geometry of the 

probe shell and crystal, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the unit. 
 
Since the detectable response of radiation depends on the geometry of the source 

generating the radiation, a conversion of the equipment readings into units of elemental 

concentrations is dependent on adequate geometrical conditions during both calibration 

and field operations. 

 

The logging data are recorded in physically compatible units, such as counts per 

seconds (cps).  Other units used in the industry are Roentgens per time unit (Rems), 

Curies, units of power as multiples of background (API units) adopted by the American 

Petroleum Institute in the oil industry, may cause confusion and should be avoided.  



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
24-14

Recently, to other units, Sievert and Bequerel, are also used in the industry.  Regardless 

of the element or the detector, 1 cps = 1 Bequerel and 1 Curie = 3.7 x 1010 Bequerels. 

 

The final objective of any calibration is to gain confidence and accuracy in equivalent 

grade concentrations (eU, eU3O8) regardless of which measuring system or detector type 

is used, and which drill hole or environmental conditions are encountered.  Frequent 

checks of the entire logging assembly should be done to ensure the operational stability 

of the equipment and the reliability of the calibration procedures.  In drilling campaigns, 

where a sufficient number of core samples are present with both assay and gross-gamma 

data, the direct correlation of the assay and gross-gamma data may be used to monitor the 

quality of the calibration. 

 
INTERPRETATION OF GROSS-GAMMA DATA 

To determine the eU3O8 of any uranium concentration by using gross-gamma data, a 

conversion from instrument readings to equivalent grade is calculated using the 

appropriate correction factors.  The basic (empirically confirmed) equation used for this 

is: 

GT = KA 

Where, 

 G is the average equivalent uranium grade expressed as eU3O8 over thickness T. 

 T is the thickness of mineralization intersected. 

   A is the numerical expression, proportional to the integrated count rate of gamma 

log over the thickness T. 

   K is the complex factor or proportionality for that particular detector assembly 

and specific to drill hole conditions. 

 

The definitions of these parameters are generalized and are dependent on the 

following: 

• The thickness (T) is usually measured from logging curve as the interval length 
between the midpoints of the anomaly flanks.  The recorded signal, however, is a 
function of the effective zone of influence around the detector.  This means that 
as the detector approaches the zone with anomalous radioactivity, it begins to 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
  www.scottwilsonmining.com 
 

 

 
24-15

respond before it reaches the zone as well as after it leaves the zone, thus 
recording an apparent thickness of radioactive zone.  The higher the grade of 
uranium mineralization, the larger the difference between the apparent thickness 
and true thickness of the mineralized zone.  There may also be a difference 
between the apparent and true thickness when the logging path is inclined, i.e. not 
orthogonal, with respect to the orientation of the mineralized layer. 

 
• The integrated count rate (A) is usually the sum of equally spaced readings 

divided by the number of readings taken over the thickness (T).  Since A 
represents an average count over the interval T, it is expressed as N. 

 
• The factor (K) depends on the particular instrument and the correction factors for 

hole conditions; it must be determined for each instrument and for each series of 
holes where geologic conditions may differ.  Also, since K is dependent on the 
intersected radioactive intensity, it must be determined for various ore grades. 

 
The accuracy of the grade of mineralization relies heavily on the quality of the 

correction factors that are employed and the homogeneity of the area of interest.  

Therefore, calibration and/or correction factors may have to be developed for each area 

significant geological changes occur which will affect the radiometric response, e.g. 

changes in equilibrium states, thorium levels, density and grade relationships, and 

distribution of uranium grades and the host rock (consolidated vs. inhomogeneous loose 

material) will require different calibration factors. 

 
GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETER LOGGING 

The gamma-ray spectrometer logging is a discriminating measurement of different 

energy levels of natural gamma radiations.  Uranium, thorium and potassium components 

form the spectrum of natural radiation and can be determined separately because of their 

characteristic gamma-ray energies.  Therefore, in some uranium deposits where the value 

of gross-gamma logging is limited due to radiometric disequilibrium and for variable 

thorium concentrations, spectrometer logging techniques may be more useful. 

 

It is preferable to use spectrometer logging techniques in early stages of uranium 

exploration as it can be used to support the properties of different lithological units, 

identify different uranium and/or thorium halos, and correlations of these haloes.

ACTIVE RADIOMETRIC DOWNHOLE LOGGING 
Active logging systems utilize sources to induce nuclear effects in the surrounding 

rock.  The source radiation is then measured to see the effects of the surrounding rock 

that it has caused.  Some systems measure the secondary radiations emitted from the 

surrounding rock immediately after excitation by the primary source radiation. 

 
NATURAL SELECTIVE GAMMA LOGGING 

This method is similar to the gamma-ray spectral logging except that an artificial 

gamma source id used.  By measuring the influence of the photoelectric effect on the 

radiation, which is dominant at the low energy level of the natural gamma ray spectrum, 

and which characteristically, occurs in most uranium mineralized rocks, the real uranium 

concentration can be determined.  This measurement is independent of equilibrium 

conditions and changes in the density of the rocks.  The shortcoming of this system, 

however, is that it is difficult to obtain a minimum accuracy as the stability of such a 

system is hard to maintain in routine field conditions. 

 
GAMMA-GAMMA LOGGING 

Gamma-gamma logging is the measurement of the in-situ density of the rock 

surrounding a drill hole.  It is obtained by detecting gamma-rays emitted from a 

radioactive source after they have undergone scattering in the material between the 

source and the detector.  Usually, the source and one or two detectors, which are shielded 

from direct radiation from the source, are mounted in the same probe.  The basic 

principle of this method is that the denser the surrounding material the more gamma 

radiation will be absorbed in the material.  Since the amount of detectable radiation is a 

function of the electron density of the material, it can deviate from the actual density of 

some rock types, especially with elements of high atomic numbers (Zeff).  In such cases, it 

is necessary to make corrections based on calibrations. 

 

The gamma-gamma logging technique can be utilised successfully in liquid or in air, 

water or mud-filled holes, and inside most casings and drill rods.  The limiting factor is 

the combined thickness of the casing and drill rods, and their equivalent atomic number.

24-17

NEUTRON LOGGING 
There are several neutron logging techniques used in the industry, and all of them 

measure the response of rock properties affected by the emission (bombardment) of 

neutrons.  The basic principle of neutron logging is that the neutrons which are emitted 

by a source are slowed down and scattered by collision with atomic nuclei.  The 

maximum loss of energy occurs in a collision when the target nucleus has a mass similar 

to that of the emitted neutron. 

 

Hydrogen atoms have the greatest effects in slowing down the neutrons to produce 

thermal energies.  The target nucleus then emits gamma radiation proportional to the 

hydrogen content of the rock.  Since the detector responds to the hydrogen content in the 

rock, which is usually the water in the pores in the rock, the neutron logging technique is 

often referred to as "porosity log".  In neutron logging the probe should not be used 

through plastic pipes, because the pipes are constructed by hydrocarbons and may cause 

erroneous results. 

 
PULSED NEUTRON LOGGING FOR URANIUM ASSAYING 

This method uses a neutron generator as the source.  The neutrons induce fission with 

U235 atoms present in the host rock.  The U235 atoms emit delayed neutrons in a very short 

time before reactivating the neutron generator.  This "bombard-wait-count" cycle is 

repeated a sufficient number of times to accumulate a statistically acceptable number of 

delayed neutron counts. 

 

If uranium is present in the host rock, the "decay" time of the delayed neutrons is 

proportional to the uranium content and is independent of disequilibrium problems or 

rapid changes of density.  This method can therefore be used for direct determination of 

the in-situ content of the uranium in the rock.  In general, however, it is expensive to use 

this method, because it is time-consuming and the diameter of the probe is usually too 

large (about 15 cm) for common drill holes, which are much smaller in diameter (6 cm to 

8 cm) in routine uranium exploration.  Recently, this method is used for routine uranium 

determination in drill cores at some commercial laboratories.

SUMMARY OF RADIOMETRIC LOGGING METHODS 
Radiometric logging is a supplementary part of most drilling programs in uranium 

exploration where natural radiation can assist in the definition of certain elements.  In 

uranium exploration programs various radiometric logging techniques have proven to be 

reliable methods for the determination of the uranium content.  The more common 

methods employed in the industry, however, are the natural gamma or gross-gamma 

methods.  These methods are routinely used to obtain lithological, stratigraphic and 

structural information.  With reliable calibration methods, gross-gamma logging data 

provide quantitative values of grade contents (eU3O8) for the purpose of resource 

estimation and mine planning. 

 

Radiometric logging systems used in uranium exploration range from simple portable 

units limited to gross-gamma measurements to highly sophisticated mobile systems 

capable of simultaneous analog and digital recording of multiple types of logs.  For the 

evaluation of logging data, such as conversion of cps values into eU3O8 values in mineral 

exploration, data processing methods and various computer programs have been 

developed to assist in resource and reserve estimation.

PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINATION OF URANIUM 
CONTENT AT SGS/BECQUEREL LABORATORIES BY THE 
NEUTRON ACTIVATION METHOD

ANALYTICAL METHOD, SGS/BEQUERAL LABORATORIES 
Instrumental neutron activation analysis (NAA) is especially powerful in its 

sensitivity and throughput and in its capacity to accurately determine many elements on a 

single sample. NAA does not require chemical treatments of samples with their attendant 

possibilities of losses and contamination and incomplete dissolution. 

 

For explorations samples, our neutron activation analysis method involves the 

transfer of 2-15 grams of sample to tarred, plastic, watertight vials. Each vial is uniquely 

identified with a bar code and a flux monitor affixed to the base.  These vials are stacked 

into one-foot long bundles for irradiation. The bundles contain randomly selected 

duplicate samples at the base of the bundle and standards inserted at random positions in 

the bundle. 

 

All bundles are treated in a similar manner. They are submitted for exposure to a flux 

of neutrons at a nuclear reactor. We currently irradiate our samples at the McMaster 

Nuclear Reactor which has flux of 8x1012 neutrons/cm2/sec. These bundles are inserted 

into the core of a nuclear reactor for twenty minutes.  In the RIFLS reactor sites, the 

bundles are rotated during irradiation so that there is no horizontal flux variation.  (The 

vertical flux variation is monitored with the individual flux monitors.) This irradiation 

causes many of the elements in the sample to become radioactive and begin to emit 

radiation in the form of penetrating gamma rays whose energies (or wavelengths) are 

characteristic of particular elements. 

 

After a decay period of six days, the irradiated samples are loaded onto the counting 

system.  The sample is placed close to a gamma-ray spectrometer with a high resolution, 

coaxial germanium detector.  Gamma rays radiate continuously and the interaction of 

these with the detector lead to discrete voltage pulses proportional in height to the 

incident gamma-ray energies.  Our specially developed multichannel analyzer sorts out 

the voltage pulses from the detector according to their size and digitally constructs a 

spectrum of gamma-ray energies versus intensities. The counting time is twenty to thirty 

minutes per sample.  After additional decay of at least ten days, the samples are

recounted for one hour.  By comparing spectral peak positions and areas with library 

standards, the elements comprising the samples are qualitatively and quantitatively 

identified. The results of the analysis are computed and data reports are generated. 

 

Becquerel Laboratories has developed special procedures for neutron activation 

analysis that contribute significantly to the higher quality of our results relative to other 

commercial laboratories. 

 

One important aspect of this is the individual neutron flux monitoring of each sample. 

(This acts as an internal standard on each sample by monitoring the vertical neutron flux 

variation in the reactor.) In addition, a randomly positioned standard is inserted into the 

bundles.

PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINATION OF URANIUM 
CONTENT AT ENERGY LABS BY THE CLOSED CAN 
METHOD, CASPER, WYOMING 

ANALYSIS OF DIAMOND DRILL CORE 
SAMPLE PREPARATION 
The sample preparation procedures are, as follows: 
 

• At the direction of the client, the drill core is split in one/half-foot sections and 
selected intervals to be analyzed for Closed Can gamma (CC) and chemical 
uranium (CU) analyses.  Both CC gamma and CU analysis splits require drying of 
the samples at approximately 105oC for more than16 hours in a convection oven 
followed by grinding via a plate pulverizer to -100 mesh. 

 
• Approximately 200 g of ground core is required for the CC gamma analysis and 

this mass is placed in a 3 in. diameter x 1 in. tall soils tin, which is then sealed 
with electrical tape. 

 
• A minimum 15 day ingrowth interval is employed to establish secular equilibrium 

between 226Ra and 214Bi, which is the gamma emitting daughter of interest.  As 
radon emanation studies have repeatedly demonstrated that a maximum of only 
30% of 222Rn can be removed from a soils matrix using somewhat extreme 
techniques, the 15-day period ensures at least a 98% complete ingrowth of 214Bi. 
"Closed Can" uranium analysis works on the premise that, in a particular ore 
body, the activities of 238U and 226Ra will be in secular equilibrium being that the 
half-life of uranium is much greater than that of 226Ra.  Once the can is sealed 
with the mineralized material, conditions are ideal for attaining secular 
equilibrium between 226Ra, 222Rn, and 214Bi, which is quantified using a 2-in. NaI 
detector at the 214Bi 609 Kev energy region.  Since 238U is the only possible 
source of 226Ra, the specific activity of 238U is applied to the tested activity of 
226Ra to determine the total uranium content.  The efficiency of the counting 
system is determined using certified 226Ra standards in the same geometry and 
density as the canned core samples.  The official method identification, which will 
be used in data reporting, is EPA-901.1. 

 
CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 
Chemical analysis is conducted on a strong mineral acid digest of the dried and ground 
core. 

• Following drying and grinding and blending the core samples, a 1-gram 
subsample is taken and delivered to a digestion vessel. 

 
• Fifty percent nitric acid and is added to the vessel (50 ml centrifuge tube), the 

vessel is loosely sealed and heated in a water bath at 95oC for more than 16 hours.

• Following the heating period, the volume is adjusted to a known level, typically 
50 ml. 

 
• Uranium analysis (and other metals) is performed on the solution by Inductively 

Coupled Argon Plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy against certified commercial 
standards (EPA-6010).
