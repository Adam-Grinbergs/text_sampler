1.0 SUMMARY 

 
 Benz Mining Corp. ("Benz") retained H. Leo King & Associates Inc. and Giroux 

Consultants Ltd. to complete a National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") Technical Report for the 

purpose of supplying updated summary information on the Mel property as well as providing a 

current resource estimate for the Mel Main Zone and making recommendations for further 

exploration. 

 

 This Technical Report was written in compliance with the disclosure and reporting 

requirements set forth in the Canadian Securities Administrator's NI 43-101, Companion Policy 

43-101 CP and Form 43-101 F1.  

 

 This Technical Report provides a current independent resource estimate for the Mel Main 

Zone, which is the most advanced of four exploration targets on the Mel property.  No drilling has 

been completed on the Property since the issue of the 2014 NI 43-101 technical report for Silver 

Range (King and Giroux, 2014), and therefore this resource is still current.  The zinc equivalent 

cut-off used for resource reporting has been adjusted to reflect current metal price forecasts. 

 

 The Mel property is located in southeast Yukon and consists of 576 mineral claims.  Benz 

has the option to purchase 100% interest in the Property, which is subject only to two (2), 1% net 

smelter return royalties.  One of the royalties is limited to metals only, and the other royalty can 

be bought out for a cash payment of $1 million.   

 

 The mineral claims comprising the Mel property are referred to as the "Property" 

throughout this Technical Report.  The Property encompasses an area of 11,451 hectares and is 

located 80 kilometers east-northeast of the town of Watson Lake.  The Property extends 47 km 

south from the main exploration targets to the Alaska Highway, following the route of a proposed 

haulage road. 

 

1.1 GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 

 

 The Property is underlain by a Cambrian to Ordovician-age sequence of marine sediments 

with minor coeval volcanic rocks, which host stratabound zinc-lead-barite mineralization.  The 

host stratigraphy is broadly folded into a north-trending overturned syncline.  This synclinal 

structure has been disrupted by north and northeast-trending faults having both vertical and lateral 

displacements. 

 

 Four zones of zinc-rich mineralization have been identified on the Property – the Mel Main, 

Jeri, Jeri North and Mel East Zones.  All of the zones occur within the same general part of the 

stratigraphic section, but there are local variations.  At the Mel Main Zone and in the southern 

parts of the Jeri and Mel East Zones, the zinc-rich mineralization is hosted within stratigraphic 

intervals that are underlain by crypto-grained limestone and overlain by a distinctive 



Page | 2  
 

phyllite/mudstone unit which grades upward into a wavy-banded argillaceous limestone.  At the 

Jeri North Zone, the equivalent stratigraphic interval contains zinc mineralization in a massive 

chert horizon that is overlain by a volcanic flow and volcaniclastic sequence, then by wavy-banded 

argillaceous limestone.  Three (3) of the 4 sediment-hosted zinc-rich zones discovered to date, 

the Mel Main, Jeri, and Jeri North Zones, have been tested by drilling.   

 

 At the Mel Main Zone, mineralization consists of coarse-grained sphalerite and galena 

disseminated throughout a mixture of mudstone, silica, carbonate and coarse crystalline barite.  

Minor amounts of fine-grained, sparsely disseminated pyrite occur locally, but overall, pyrite 

accounts for less than 2% of the sulphides.  The Mel Main Zone has a strike length of about 700 

meters and extends from surface to a depth of at least 500 meters.  It remains open to extension 

at depth and has potential for a significant increase in size. 

 

 The mineralization at the Mel Main, Jeri, Jeri North and Mel East Zones is sediment-

hosted, stratabound and epigenetic.  It has not been reliably categorized as to its deposit type.  

The zones exhibit certain features that are characteristic of carbonate replacement, sedimentary 

exhalative and unconformity/karst-related deposits, but none of these models is an ideal fit for the 

mineralization on the Property.  

 

1.2 HISTORY AND EXPLORATION 

 

 The Property was first staked by prospectors J. Melynchuk and T. Flint in 1967 and it has 

subsequently been explored by a number of owners and operators, including Newmont Mining 

Corporation Ltd., Granby Mining Corp., St. Joseph Exploration Ltd., Sulpetro Ltd., Novamin 

Resources Ltd., Barytex Resources Ltd., Cominco Ltd., Kobex Minerals Inc., and most recently 

Silver Range Resources (Silver Range). 

 

 Exploration activities have included numerous soil geochemical surveys, geophysical 

surveys (IP, gravity, VLF and magnetics), LIDAR surveys, trenching, diamond drilling, 

metallurgical test work, and several resource estimations.  A 1989 pre-feasibility study by 

Sandwell Swan Wooster Inc. concluded that the Mel Main Zone was potentially viable and 

provided recommendations for further exploration and development.   

 

 To date, a total of 90 diamond drill holes (16,759 m) have been completed on the Property.  

The Mel Main Zone has been systematically drill tested but remains open to depth.  The Jeri and 

Jeri North Zones have received limited, reconnaissance-level drilling, and the Mel East Zone is 

untested by drilling.

1.3 HISTORICAL METALLURGICAL TESTWORK 

 

 Preliminary metallurgical testing on drill core from the Mel Main Zone by Lakefield 

Research in 1979 indicates that after grinding to 100 mesh, the mineralization responded well to 

flotation and yielded concentrates ranging from 60.9% to 64.7% zinc, 78.0% to 79.6% lead, and 

90.3% to 94.4% barite with recoveries of 90.3% to 96.2% for zinc, 97.7% to 98.0% for lead, and 

88.0% to 90.0% for barite.  A later, larger scale test was done for barite concentrate market 

evaluation.  A concentrate grading 95.1% barite, with a recovery of 92.6%, was produced from 

12 kilograms of feed grading 53.5% barite. 

 

1.4 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

 

 The Inferred Mineral Resource for the Mel Main Zone comprises 5,280,000 tonnes grading 

6.51% zinc (Zn), 1.86% lead (Pb) and 45.05% barite (BaSO4).  This resource is stated above a 

5.0% zinc-equivalent (ZnEQ%) cut-off grade.  A summary of Inferred Mineral Resources at 

various zinc-equivalent cut-off grades is provided in Table 1.1. 

 

 The Mel Main Zone mineral resource estimate was completed by Gary Giroux, P. Eng., 

MASc. of Giroux Consulting Ltd.  Mr. Giroux is a qualified person and independent of Benz, based 

on the guidelines provided by NI 43-101.

7.0 3,970,000 7.08 2.00 9.10 44.59 

 

 Data generated during the various drill programs conducted at Mel Main Zone were 

independently reviewed by Giroux Consultants Ltd.  In 2012, 107 pieces of drill core were selected 

and re-sampled by taking ¼ of the core.  In general, the duplicate assays match the original 

assays very well and show no analytical bias. 

The resource estimate for the Mel Main Zone was initiated using a wire-frame 3D solid 

model in "GEMS."  Three-dimensional solids were manually digitized from the available drill data 

and were used to constrain the interpolation of mineralization.  The model was constructed based 



Page | 4  
 

upon mineralogical boundaries and structural controls.  Two solids were created, each 

representing a separate mineralogical domain ("Mineralized Solid" and "Barite Shell"). 

Drill holes were "passed through" these geological solids with the entry and exit points 

recorded.  Using this information, the assays were "back-tagged" with different codes if inside or 

outside the solids.  Of the 64 supplied drill holes, 48 intersected the Mineralized Solid. 

A block model with dimensions 10 meters north-south, 5 meters east-west and 5 meters 

vertical was superimposed over the domain solids.  For each block, the percentage below surface 

topography and within each mineralized solid was recorded. 

The bulk density for rock within the Mel Main Zone was established from 47 specific gravity 

determinations.  A specific gravity for each domain was calculated by using a regression equation 

and the estimated values for lead, zinc and barite in the two mineralized domains and the waste 

domain.  A nominal specific gravity of 1.8 was applied to overburden.   

Uniform, two meter long, down-hole composites were produced to honour the Mineralized 

Solids and Barite Shell.  Grades for the elements of interest were interpolated into blocks within 

the Mineralized Solid and Barite Shell using Ordinary Kriging.  The kriging exercise was 

completed in a series of four passes.  Appropriate block model validation techniques for resource 

estimation at this stage of project development were applied. 

 1.5 BARITE MARKETING STUDIES 

 

A historical barite marketing study was carried out on the Property by MineStart 

Management Inc. in 1989 to evaluate potential marketability of barite products (Slim, 1989).  This 

study concluded that the Property offers potential for production of large tonnages with an overall 

grade of 52% barite.  Due to its location, the Property could provide a competitive advantage over 

barite from more distant sources.  In addition to revenue from barite sales, the study also noted 

potential capital cost benefits due to a reduction in the size of a tailings disposal facility. 

World Industrial Minerals completed a recent marketing study in September 2014 

(Guilinger, 2014) for Silver Range.  This study concluded, based on a review of historical test 

work, that the Property should be able to produce a saleable barite product.  Based on current 

market demand, it recommended at an initial sales rate of 50,000 metric tonnes per year, at a 

price of $100 USD/tonne (Free on Board (FOB) mine site) should be achievable.  The study also 

noted potential concerns with regards to mercury, cadmium and base metal concentrations in the 

barite product, and recommended that follow-up test work be conducted to verify acceptable metal 

levels.

1.6 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

  

 The zinc-lead-barite zones on the Property are sediment-hosted, stratabound and 

epigenetic and occur at a recognizable stratigraphic interval.   

 

 The host rocks are Cambrian to Ordovician-age marine carbonate and clastic sediments 

with minor volcanic rocks, which are broadly folded into a north-trending, overturned syncline that 

is cut by a number of north and northeast-trending faults having both vertical and lateral 

displacements. 

 

 The Mel Main Zone consists of zinc-lead-barite mineralization that occurs on the western 

limb of the syncline within a lensoid body of mudstone, silica and carbonate.  The mineralized 

body is underlain by crypto-grained limestone and overlain by a distinctive phyllite/mudstone unit 

that grades upward into wavy-banded argillaceous limestone. 

 

 An Inferred Resource at the Mel Main Zone is estimated at 5,280,000 tonnes of 6.51% 

Zn, 1.86% Pb and 45.05% barite using a 5% zinc equivalent cut-off.  In-fill drilling to up-grade the 

resource is warranted.  The deposit is open to extension down dip, with potential for a significant 

increase in tonnage. 

 

 The Jeri Zone, located 4 kilometers northeast of the Mel Main Zone, is situated on the 

eastern limb of the same syncline that hosts the zinc-lead-barite mineralization at the Mel Main 

Zone.  At the Jeri Zone, the crypto-grained limestone unit that lies in the footwall of the Mel Main 

Zone has been altered to zinc-bearing hydrothermal dolomite and silicified dolomite.  The zinc 

mineralization has been exposed by limited trenching and shallow drilling, and there is potential 

for additional discoveries within this thick dolomitized section of limestone.  An untested 

geophysical anomaly at the south end of the Jeri Zone is interpreted to be located at the base of 

the dolomitized limestone and represents an attractive drill target.   

 

 At Jeri North Zone, located five kilometers north of the Jeri Zone on the same limb of the 

syncline, coarse-grained sphalerite occurs within a chert unit that is capped by a volcanic flow 

and tuff sequence.  The mineralized chert rests on the same crypto-grained limestone that forms 

the base of the Mel Main Zone.  The chert unit and volcanic sequence are not present at the Mel 

Main and Jeri Zones. 

 

 There is untested potential within a three kilometer long portion of the favorable 

stratigraphy, which lies between the Jeri and Jeri North Zones, and within another four kilometer 

long section that extends northward from the Jeri North Zone.   

 

 The Mel East Zone consists of zinc showings that are interpreted to occur along a faulted 

off-set or fold repeated section of the same stratigraphic sequence that hosts the Mel Main, Jeri 



Page | 6  
 

and Jeri North Zones.  Anomalous zinc-lead soil geochemistry and a coincident IP anomaly have 

defined a target that has not yet been tested by drilling or trenching. 

 

 Based on the amount and nature of the mineralization discovered to date, it is concluded 

that the Property offers attractive potential for extension of known zones and discovery of 

additional zinc-rich mineralization.  Exploration at the Mel Main Zone has outlined a mineral 

resource of potential economic interest and initial metallurgical test work has produced 

encouraging results.  Further work within and around the Mel Main, Jeri, Jeri North and Mel East 

Zones is warranted. 

 

1.7 RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 Benz should conduct additional mapping, sampling, trenching and diamond drilling to 

determine the potential for expansion along strike and down-dip of the Mel Main Zone.  Trenching 

and drilling should also be done to further assess the potential of the Jeri, Jeri North and Mel East 

Zones.  Further metallurgical test work and specific gravity studies should be undertaken using 

core from diamond drilling.  Environmental, geotechnical and heritage baseline studies should be 

initiated.  Road access and airstrip maintenance should be undertaken in conjunction with the 

exploration. 

 

 The proposed work outlined above should be completed in two phases.  The Phase 1 

budget is estimated to be $149,820, and the Phase 2 budget to be $1,831,500. 

 

2.0 INTRODUCTION 

  
 This Technical Report has been prepared at the request of the Management of Benz 

Mining Corp. (Benz) in order to summarize results of historic exploration on the Property and 

provide an updated Inferred Mineral Resource estimate for the Mel Main Zone.  The mineral 

resource estimate was prepared using drill data compiled during 2011 and 2012 by Kobex 

Minerals Inc., and by Silver Range Resources (Silver Range) in 2014 and 2015, from diamond 

drill programs carried out on the Mel Main Zone during the period from 1973 to 1994. 

 This Technical Report was written in compliance with disclosure and reporting 

requirements set forth in the Canadian Securities Administration's current "Standards of 

Disclosure for Mineral Projects" under the provisions of NI 43-101, Companion Policy 43-101CP 

and Form 43-101F1. 

Zinc-lead-barite mineralization was first discovered on the Property by prospectors in 1967.  

Exploration work has been carried out on the Property intermittently over a period of 45 years by 

a number of companies.  The most recent exploration was done in 2012. 

The 257 mineral claims covering the main areas of interest on the Property, the "Core 

Claims", were purchased by Silver Range from Kobex Minerals Inc. in June 2014.  Subsequently 



Page | 7  
 

another 319 claims were staked along two access routes extending from the Core Claims to the 

Alaska Highway.  

 In March 2017 Benz obtained the right to purchase 100% interest in the Property from 

Silver Range for a total consideration of $2,700,000. Benz is currently listed on the NEX board of 

the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) and has completed this Technical Report in partial fulfillment 

of requirements to graduate to and be listed on the TSX-V.  The 257 core claims are subject to a 

1% Net Smelter Return ("NSR") royalty payable to Whirlwind Capital Ltd. on metals produced 

from the Core Claims and a second 1% NSR royalty payable to Kobex Minerals Inc. on any 

minerals or metals produced from the Core Claims, which can be purchased for a sum of $1 

million. 

H. Leo King, P. Geo., was retained to prepare Sections 1 to 13 inclusive and Sections 15 

to 21 inclusive of this Technical Report.  Giroux Consultants Ltd. was retained to prepare the 

mineral resource estimate as set out in Section 14.  H. Leo King supervised several exploration 

programs on the Property during the period from 1976 to 1989 and managed exploration 

programs during 1993, 1994 and 1995.  He last visited the Property on June 7, 2012.  Subsequent 

to his last visit, Silver Range completed aerial photography, LIDAR topographic surveys, a 

heritage resource overview study, a barite marketing study and a resource estimation.  These 

desktop studies conducted subsequent to Mr. King's last visit were based upon air photos and 

information collected in 2012 and earlier.   Mr. King has reviewed these studies and does not 

consider there to be a material change to the scientific and technical information since his last 

visit.

consideration of $2,700,000, payable in increments annually over 5 years, with $475,000 required 

to be paid in cash and the balance of $2,225,000 payable in shares or cash at the Company's 

election. The Property is subject only to a 1% NSR royalty payable on metal production from the 

Core Claims to Whirlwind Capital Ltd. and a second 1% NSR royalty payable on mineral and 

metal production from the Core Claims to Kobex Minerals Inc., which can be purchased for a sum 

of 1 million dollars ($1,000,000). 

 In Yukon, mineral claims can be maintained in good standing by performing approved 

exploration work to a dollar value of one hundred dollars ($100) per claim per year or by payment 

of $100 in lieu of work per claim per year.  Exploration and development expenditures in the 

current anniversary year may be applied to a maximum of five (5) future anniversary years, and 

those anniversary years may be added to any previous surplus anniversary years.  Sufficient 

expenditures have been filed to keep all claims within Yukon, comprising the Property in good 

standing until at least April 3, 2024.  One claim, located in British Columbia, is set to expire on 

November 13, 2017. 

 Exploration work in the Yukon is subject to the Mining Land Use Regulations of the Yukon 

Quartz Mining Act and to the Yukon Environmental and Socio-Economic Act.  Yukon 

Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment Board recommendations must be issued and a 

Mining Land Use approval must be obtained, before advanced exploration may be conducted. 

 A Mining Land Use Approval and Approved Operating Plan (LQ00431) was issued for the 

Property in August 2015 allowing for exploration activities to be conducted to August 2025.  Pre-

season and post-season reports are required to be filed each year. 

 The Property is subject to regular inspections by Mining Land Use officials.  There are no 

known environmental liabilities except to reclaim roads prior to the expiration of the current Mining 

Land Use approval.  The author does not know of any surface rights impediments to the Property. 

 The Property is located within the traditional territory of the Kaska First Nation, which has 

not yet signed a Land Claims agreement with the governments of Yukon and Canada.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 The Property is located about 400 kilometers east of the city of Whitehorse, in southeast 

Yukon.  Access to the Property is by helicopter or fixed wing aircraft from the town of Watson 

Lake, located on the Alaska Highway about 80 kilometers to the west-southwest of the Property.  

Seasonal access is provided by a bush trail/winter road, which is approximately 47 kilometers 



Page | 10  
 

long and leaves the Alaska Highway at a point 77 kilometers by road east of Watson Lake, 

following a northerly route through the gentle terrain to the Property.  A 640 meter long airstrip, 

which requires minor repair, is located on the Property. 

 The Alaska Highway provides a link to the Port of Skagway located 670 kilometers by road 

to the west of the Property.  Rail access is available at the town of Fort Nelson, 510 kilometers by 

road to the southeast.  The communities of Lower Post and Watson Lake, are the nearest 

population centers. 

 The climate at the Property is characterized by long, cold winters and short, moderate 

summers.  Precipitation is moderate and winter snow accumulation is in the order of 80 

centimeters.  Drilling can be carried out in all seasons, but is not recommended during the spring 

break-up. 

 With the exception of a single claim located in BC, the surface rights are held by the 

government of Yukon and water rights are under jurisdiction of the Territorial Water Board.  Any 

mining operation would require regulatory approvals.  There is no electrical power available at the 

Property.  However, a large thermal coal resource is located 10 kilometers north of the Property.  

Water from small lakes and streams on the Property provide sufficient water for camp and 

diamond drilling requirements.  There are ample areas suitable for potential plant sites, tailings 

storage and waste disposal on the Property. 

 The majority of supplies and services required for mineral exploration and mining are 

available in Whitehorse.  Many supplies and services are also available in Watson Lake including 

hotels, restaurants, stores, a hospital, an airport, charter aircraft and heavy equipment. 

 The Property is situated within the Liard Plateau on the southern fringe of the Logan 

Mountains.  The terrain is characterized by subdued topography with local elevations ranging 

from 900 meters at valley bottoms to 1,200 meters at hill tops.  The Property is entirely below tree 

line, and vegetation consists of spruce, pine and balsam with willow and alder comprising much 

of the understory.  Most of the area is in varying stages of regeneration following forest fires. 

6.0 HISTORY 

 Historical exploration was largely compiled from assessment reports submitted to the 

Yukon Mining Recorder and from internal company reports and memorandum.  A summary of 

historical exploration work on the Property is provided in Table 6.1. 

Extensive exploration work was carried out on the Property by several operators at various times 

between 1967 and 1997.  The Property was dormant from 1997 to 2012.  Results of previous 

exploration work, including location and extent of known mineralization, geochemical and 

geophysical anomalies, trenches and drill holes, are illustrated on Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4.

The Property was first staked by prospectors in 1967 and was subsequently acquired by 

Empire Metals Corporation Ltd. ("Empire").  Newmont Mining Corporation ("Newmont") optioned 

the Property and conducted a program of trenching and soil geochemical surveys in 1968.  Five 

trenches dug by Newmont exposed the Mel Main Zone zinc-lead-barite mineralization over a 

strike length of 488 meters.  Samples taken from the trenches averaged 5.3% combined lead-

zinc over widths from 2.3 to 9 meters. 

 In September 1973, Newmont dropped its option and the Property reverted to Empire.  

Granby Mining Corp. ("Granby") then optioned the Property, and between 1974 and 1975, it 

conducted a diamond drill program of 18 holes (1,952 meters).  Granby's drilling intersected two 

parallel, north-striking, barite-sphalerite-galena zones the, Mel Main Zone and Mel Main North 

Extension (Figure 6.1).  Mineralized intervals in the Mel Main Zone reportedly averaged 6.1 

meters true width, but only weak mineralization was intersected in the Mel Main Extension 

(Chisholm, 1973 and Wilkinson, 1975). 

In January 1976, Empire changed its name to Sovereign Metals Corporation Ltd. 

("Sovereign").  Later that year, St. Joseph Explorations Ltd. ("St. Joseph") optioned the Property 

from Sovereign and conducted geological mapping, geochemical and geophysical surveys.  

During 1978 and 1979, St. Joseph completed a 19-hole diamond drill program totaling 4,054 

meters (Miller, 1977 and 1979).  Preliminary metallurgical testing conducted on drill core from the 

Mel Main Zone by Lakefield Research in 1978 yielded concentrates ranging from 60.9% to 64.7% 

Zn, 78.0% to 79.6% Pb and 90.3% to 94.4% barite. 

In 1981, St. Joseph sold its 51% interest in the Property to Sulpetro Ltd.  Following the 

sale, Sulpetro Minerals Ltd. ("Sulpetro") was established to hold the Property.  Regional 

exploration conducted by Sulpetro in 1981 led to the discovery of the Mel East Zone, a zinc 

showing located 7.3 kilometers northeast of the Mel Main Zone (Miller and Blanchflower, 1982).  

Limited geochemical surveys conducted by Sulpetro over the next two years defined a large zinc 

soil anomaly in the area of the Mel East Zone. 

Geological mapping and geochemical soil sampling conducted in 1984 between the Mel 

Main Zone and the Mel East Zone recognized a zinc showing at the Jeri Zone, located 4 

kilometers north-northeast of the Mel Main Zone.  During 1985, Sulpetro drilled 10 holes totaling 

1,009 meters to test the Jeri Zone (Miller, 1985).  Nine (9) of the 10 holes drilled over a strike 

length of 550 meters intersected zinc mineralization.  Significant zinc values were intersected in 

4 of the holes: 3.37 meters of 13.11% Zn in Hole J-85-1, 4.5 meters of 7.96% Zn in Hole J-85-2, 

2 meters of 14.6% Zn in Hole J-85-4 and 4.24 meters of 3.78% Zn in Hole J-85-5.  Later that year, 

Sulpetro sold its interest to Novamin Resources Ltd. ("Novamin"), which in 1987 drill-tested the 

Mel Main Zone at depth with 7 holes totaling 2,012 meters.  Drill results indicated that the zinc-

lead-barite mineralization continued to a depth of 490 meters below surface (Miller, 1987).  

Breakwater Resources Ltd. purchased Novamin in 1988, thus obtaining joint ownership of the 

Property with Barytex Resources Corp. ("Barytex"), formerly Sovereign.

In 1989, Barytex conducted a soil geochemical survey near the Jeri Zone and completed 

four diamond drill holes (663 meters) on the Mel Main Zone.  The drill program consisted of in-fill 

drilling at the north end of the Mel Main Zone and confirmed the continuity of the mineralization 

(Miller, 1989). 

In 1990, Barytex conducted an in-fill drill program consisting of 11 diamond drill holes 

totaling 1,552 meters plus surface stripping.  Drilling between previous, widely-spaced holes aided 

in the design of an open-pit (Miller, 1990). 

A resource estimate, based on 48 intersections from 42 diamond drill holes, was prepared 

by consultants Nevin Sadlier-Brown Goodbrand Ltd. in a report dated October 9, 1990 (Croft, 

1990).  Additional metallurgical test work by Westcoast Mineral Testing Inc. generally confirmed 

earlier metallurgical results (Hawthorn, 1990).  

In November 1992, Barytex was reorganized and the company's name changed to 

International Barytex Resources Ltd. ("IBX").   

During 1993, IBX staked another 86 claims to cover the northerly strike extension of the 

Jeri Zone and established 66 line-kilometers of grid.  Geological mapping traced the favorable 

contact hosting the Jeri Zone zinc mineralization for a strike length of over 9 kilometers and 

discovered the Jeri North Zone.  Eleven (11) trenches excavated in 1993, exposed mineralization 

along a 2.5 kilometers section of the Jeri Zone.  The most significant assay results from trench 

sampling were obtained from trench 5, where a 5 meter wide interval averaged 16.5% Zn and in 

trench 4, where a 5 meter wide interval averaged 10.7% Zn (King, 1994a).  At the Jeri North Zone, 

on the northern extension of the Jeri Zone, reconnaissance soil sampling was carried out on lines 

spaced 1,000 meters apart from section 166N to 206N.  Soil samples were taken at 25 meter 

intervals along section lines that crossed the favorable contact zone.   

In 1994, IBX established grid lines spaced 100 meters apart from line 130N to 152N at the 

Jeri North Zone.  Soil samples were collected at 25 meter intervals along lines that crossed the 

favorable contact zone.  A total of 59 soil samples were taken.  The soil sampling revealed 

anomalous zinc and lead values along the favorable contact (King, 1994b).  

In 1994, six additional drill holes totaling 3,122 meters were drilled by IBX at the Mel Main 

Zone.  Higher grade intersections were obtained from those holes, with some intersections 

grading in excess of 12% combined lead-zinc.  The highest grade intersection assayed 19.72% 

zinc over an estimated true thickness of 5.16 meters (King, 1994b).  This was the last drilling 

completed on the Mel Main Zone, and it remains open to extension down dip.  A representative 

drill section through the Mel Main Zone is shown in Figure 6.5. 

Geophysical surveys including magnetic, very-low-frequency ("VLF") and IP surveys were 

carried out by IBX in 1994 over the southerly projection of the Mel Main Zone.  VLF and magnetic 

coverage extended from lines 82N to 96N and IP surveys were conducted on lines 82N to 84N, 

88N + 50N and 89N to 91N.  The IP survey outlined a chargeability and resistivity anomaly on 



Page | 19  
 

line 84N that is on-strike with the Mel Main Zone.  The geophysical work was carried out by S.J.V. 

Consultants Ltd., a geophysical contractor. 

 Reconnaissance soil sampling was also carried out by IBX in 1994 on-strike and to the 

north of the Mel Main Zone from 114N to 134N.  Samples were taken along grid lines spaced 200 

meters apart.  Sample density varied from 10 meter to 20 meter spacing along the lines.  A total 

of 54 soil samples were collected.  No anomalous zinc or lead values were returned from this soil 

sampling (King, 1994b). 

At the Jeri North Zone, soil sampling was done across a 2 kilometer long segment of the 

favorable contact between crypto-grained limestone and wavy-banded limestone in 1994 by IBX.  

Samples were taken at 25 meter intervals along lines spaced 200 meters apart.  Anomalous soil 

geochemical zinc and lead values were returned on most lines sampled.  Two zinc soil 

geochemical anomalies were outlined; one extending from line 131N to 143N, and the other from 

line 150N to 152N (Figure 6.3).  IP geophysical surveys were carried out over lines 135N and 

136N within one of these zinc soil anomalies.  Strong chargeability highs were outlined on both 

lines, coincident with the zinc anomaly that marks the favorable contact between wavy-banded 

limestone and the underlying crypto-grained limestone (King, 1994b) 

In 1995, an IP survey was conducted by IBX on lines 85N and 86N, approximately one 

kilometer south of the Mel Main Zone.  This survey defined coincident chargeability and resistivity 

anomalies that extend to the north of an anomaly first identified on line 84N during the 1994 survey 

(Figure 6.1).  Two diamond drill holes (317.5m) were completed on Section 85N in an attempt to 

explain the IP anomaly outlined on lines 84N to 86N.  Minor graphite was noted in the core along 

several shear zones, which may explain the IP anomaly.  However, the targeted contact zone 

between the wavy-banded limestone and the crypto-grained limestone was not intersected (King, 

1995). 

Geochemical and geophysical surveys were conducted in 1995 by IBX at the Jeri North 

Zone. IP surveys were carried out on grid lines spaced 100 meters apart from lines 131N to 142N.  

Strong chargeability highs and corresponding resistivity lows, partially coincident with anomalous 

zinc soil geochemical values, were outlined over a strike length of 1,100 meters (Figure 6.3). 

A program of diamond drilling was carried out in 1995 by IBX to test the coincident IP and 

geochemical anomalies at the Jeri North Zone.  Eight (8) widely-spaced drill holes, totaling 847.6 

meters, tested the anomalous zone over a strike length of 2 kilometers.  This drilling intersected 

a sequence of intermediate volcanic flows and volcaniclastic sediments that are overlain by the 

relatively thin unit of calcareous phyllite/mudstone that forms the base of the wavy-banded 

limestone throughout much of the Property.  A massive chert unit up to 5 meters thick was 

intersected below the volcanic-volcaniclastic sequence.  In places, the chert rests directly on the 

basal crypto-grained limestone unit but on other sections it is separated from the crypto-grained 

limestone by a dolomitic horizon.  Sphalerite was encountered mainly within the chert unit, with 

lesser amounts occurring in an overlying ash layer and in the underlying dolomitic horizon.  Five 

(5) of the 8 holes drilled intersected zinc mineralization, with two of these holes yielding high zinc

assays: 15.6% Zn over a core length of 5.1 meters in hole J-95-5 and 9.9% Zn over a core length 

of 5 meters in hole J-95-4 (King, 1995). 

In 1996, Cominco Ltd. ("Cominco"), under an option agreement with IBX, began 

exploration work on the Property.  Work was carried out on the Jeri North and Mel East Zones 

and in an area immediately south of the Mel Main Zone. 

One diamond drill hole was drilled 1.5 kilometers south of the Mel Main Zone to test an IP 

anomaly believed to represent the southern extension of the favorable mineralized horizon 

hosting the Mel Main Zone.  This drill hole did not reach the favorable contact zone. 

At the Jeri North Zone, exploration work included six diamond drill holes totaling 1,189 

meters.  These holes further tested zinc mineralization discovered in 1995.  Drill hole J-96-10, 

located 200 meters south along strike of holes J-95-4 and J-95-5 encountered 12.38% Zn over a 

3.0 meter core length.  The other five holes drilled within this area intersected lower grade 

mineralization (Senft, 1996). 

Cominco conducted additional soil sampling in 1996 to the north of the Jeri North Zone 

along grid lines from 149N to 224N.  Several anomalous samples lie along the projected trace of 

the mineralized horizon. 

At the Mel East Zone, Cominco conducted a soil sampling program to confirm the 

presence of the large zinc anomaly identified by Sulpetro during its 1983 exploration program.  

Strong zinc values were outlined over an area 1,400 meters long by 150 meters wide and open 

to the north, south and east.  This anomaly is coincident with the favorable contact hosting the 

zinc showing referred to as the Mel East Zone and represents an attractive drill target. 

In 1997, Cominco completed soil sampling in three areas on the Property.  Four lines of 

soil sampling were completed south of the Mel Main Zone on lines 87N to 90N.  Three lines of 

soil sampling were also completed at the Jeri Zone at 50 meter intervals along lines spaced 200 

meters apart.  A total of 39 samples were collected.  In the area of the Mel East Zone, a single 

contour line of soil sampling totaling 39 samples was completed to cover the southern extension 

of the mineralized horizon (Senft and Hall, 1998).   

During 1997, Cominco conducted IP and resistivity surveys in three areas: south of the 

Mel Main Zone, the Mel East Zone area, and an area in the southern part of the Jeri Zone.  In 

addition, a magnetic survey and a limited gravity survey were conducted south of the Mel Main 

Zone.  The geophysical program identified anomalies in all three areas surveyed.  A compilation 

of the geophysical surveys carried on the Mel Main, Jeri, Jeri North and Mel East Zones are shown 

on Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 respectively.  Two drill holes totaling 360.9 meters tested 

geophysical conductors located 1.5 kilometers south of the Mel Main Zone.  These holes 

intersected carbonaceous mudstones, which are interpreted to be a source for the geophysical 

anomalies, but neither of these drill holes cut the favorable contact that hosts the Mel Main Zone.

In 2012, Kobex Minerals Inc. ("Kobex") carried out a soil sampling program on a portion 

of the Jeri North Zone (Livingstone, 2012 and King, 2013).  A total of 229 soil samples were 

collected and analyzed to fill in gaps in the 1996 soil sampling carried out at the Jeri North Zone 

by Cominco.  Samples were collected from four separate grids along east-west lines spaced 100 

meter apart, with soil sampling stations spaced at 50 meter intervals. 

Of the 229 samples collected, 12 returned anomalous zinc values, 12 returned anomalous 

lead values and 12 returned anomalous barium values.  Results of the 2012 soil sampling program 

confirm the presence of elevated zinc in soils within all 4 of the previously established grids at the 

Jeri North Zone and extended 2 of the areas of anomalous zinc values (Figure 6.6).  Lead values 

are typically low.   

To date a total of 90 diamond drill holes (16,759 meters) have been drilled on the Mel 

property.  Appendix I contains data concerning locations, orientations and lengths of the drill 

holes.  Appendix II lists the significant mineralized intervals in the holes.   

In June 2014, Sliver Range purchased the Property from Kobex, and in September 2014, 

Breakwater sold its NSR royalty to Whirlwind Capital Ltd.  

In 2015, Silver Range completed LIDAR, aerial photography, a heritage resource overview 

assessment, a barite marketing study, and updated the mineral resource estimate (Stevens, 

2015). 

As of March 2017, Benz has the right to acquire 100% interest in the Property from Silver 

Range.  

6.1 HISTORICAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

 Several historical resource estimates have been made for the Mel Main Zone, based on 

drilling results from that zone.  A summary of the historical mineral resource estimates is provided 

in Table 6.2. 

 Most of the resource estimates were completed by company personnel, listed in Table 

6.2, during the course of drilling carried out from 1975 to 1994.  The exception was an independent 

resource estimate, made by Nevin Sadlier-Brown Goodbrand Ltd. in October 1990. As all of these 

estimates were completed prior to the implementation of NI43-101, no technical reports are 

available for any of these historic resources. 

 Although these resource estimates were completed prior to the implementation of NI43-

101, it is the Author's opinion that they followed industry standard best practices at the time.  All 

of the historical mineral resource estimates were calculated using a polygonal method, using 

available drill data.    

Specific gravity determinations were applied to individual samples within mineralized 

intersections, which were then used to calculate a weighted average grade of the intersection.

The true width of the intersection was obtained from measurements of contact angles compared 

with geological cross sections.

The historical resource estimates reported herein are sourced from internal company 

memorandum and the October 1990 consultant's report by Nevin Sadlier-Brown Goodbrand Ltd.  

The resource estimates listed herein are historical in nature and a Qualified Person has not done 

sufficient work to classify these historical resource estimates as current mineral resources.  Benz 

is not treating the historical resource estimates as current mineral resources.   

The terms "Drill Indicated and Indicated" are historical terms used by previous operators, 

and are not comparable to the CIM defined Indicated Resource, and should be compared to a 

potential estimate deposit requiring further exploration drilling to define an initial resource. 

 The author notes that the historical resource estimates reported by various previous 

owners of the Property cannot be relied upon, and are quoted for historical purposes only.  

However, these historical resource estimates do provide an indication of zinc-lead-barite 

mineralization potential on the Mel Main Zone. 

 The mineral resource reported herein (see Section 14) supersedes all historical resource 

estimates.

6.2 HISTORICAL METALLURGICAL TESTWORK 

 Preliminary metallurgical testing on core from the Mel Main Zone by Lakefield Research 

in 1976 (Wyslouzil and Bulatovic, 1976) indicated that after grinding to 100 mesh, the 

mineralization responded well to flotation and yielded concentrates ranging from 60.9% to 64.7% 

zinc, 78.0% to 79.6% lead, and 90.3% to 94.4% barite with recoveries of 90.3% to 96.2% for zinc, 

97.7% to 98.0% for lead, and 88.0% to 90.0% for barite.  A later, larger scale test was done for 

barite concentrate marketing evaluation.  A concentrate grading 95.1% barite with a recovery of 

92.6% was produced from 12 kilograms of feed grading 53.5% barite. 

Further metallurgical testing on core from the Mel Main Zone by Westcoast Mineral 

Testing (WMT) in 1990 (Hawthorn, 1990) mainly duplicated the results achieved by Lakefield 

Research in 1976, except that a small portion of the zinc reported to the lead concentrate, 

resulting in a 10% zinc content in an otherwise clean lead concentrate.  Optical microscopy of the 

lead concentrate indicated that through proper regrinding and reagent manipulation, the zinc 

grade of the lead concentrate could be reduced to less than 3%. WMT also measured the 

composite sample's specific gravity to be 3.5 and the grindability to be very low at 6.4 kWh/t. 

6.3 BARITE MARKETING STUDIES 

A historical barite marketing study was completed in 1989 by MineStart Management Inc. 

(Slim, 1989) and concluded that barite from the Property demonstrated positive potential as a 

saleable by-product.  The study noted that barite demand is highly cyclical, with the vast majority 

of barite consumption occurring as part of oil and gas drilling.  For any development of the 

Property, MineStart noted that a good stockpile would be important, as barite purchasers will want 

demonstration of continuous supply.  Considering barite as a by-product also enables stockpiling 

for more favorable market conditions, and separates the economics of barite sales from those of 

the main minerals.  Sales of barite products were deemed to be particularly attractive for the 

Property as they would not only provide an additional revenue stream, but also reduce capital 

costs due to less need for tailings disposal capability.  

World Industrial Minerals completed a new barite marketing study in September 2014 

(Guilinger, 2014).  This study examined historical data from metallurgical test work on the Property 

and investigated current market trends, pricing and sales opportunities throughout North America.  

Based on data from flotation tests conducted in the 1980s, the study found that the Property 

should be able to produce a barite product with sufficient grade to meet the specifications for 

drilling mud, chemical and construction applications (>94% BaSO4).  However, while the historical 

test work showed that the necessary grade could be achieved, there were concerns regarding 

the mercury, cadmium and base metal content of the barite concentrate, which were not specified 

in the historical test work results.  The study recommended follow-up analysis and test work to 

determine probable lead, zinc, cadmium and mercury contents of the barite concentration with 

respect to specifications and requirements for use in drilling fluids.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

 The Property is located within Selwyn Basin, a tectonic element comprising deep water 

clastic rocks and chert with minor carbonate and volcanic strata, which accumulated along the 

North American continental margin during Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic time.  Selwyn Basin 

extends from Alaska through Yukon and western Northwest Territories into British Columbia 

(Figure 7.1).  The basin is bounded to the northeast by a carbonate platform (MacDonald 

Platform), which comprises the near-shore facies of ancient North America (Abbott et al, 1986). 

 In the area of the Property, Selwyn Basin lies east of units belonging to Cassiar, Slide 

Mountain and Yukon-Tanana Terranes, which are pericratonic and oceanic terranes that were 

formed along the western margin of ancient North America in Paleozoic time.  Deformation and 

metamorphism associated with accretion of these and other allochthonous terranes was initiated 

in Middle Jurassic and culminated in Tertiary time.  The resulting transpressional/transextensional 

orogenic belt is referred to as the Cordilleran orogen (Nelson and Colpron, 2007). 

 Post-accretion strike-slip movement along the Tintina Fault resulted in about 450 

kilometers of dextral offset, dismembering various terranes within the orogenic belt (Murphy and 

Mortensen, 2003).  The Property is located about 40 kilometers northeast of the Tintina Fault.   

 The Property is situated on the Coal River map sheet (NTS 95D), which was mapped by 

the Geological Survey of Canada in 1967 (Gabrielse and Blusson, 1969).  More detailed mapping 

was conducted in the immediate vicinity of the Property by the Department of Indian and Northern 

Affairs in the early 1970s (Carne, 1976) and the Yukon Geological Survey in 2006 and 2007 

(Pigage, 2008).  Pigage's maps and report incorporate many observations made by economic 

and academic geologists, who worked on the Property or studied rocks and minerals taken from 

it.  The following description of the regional geological setting is primarily based upon Pigage's 

report.  

 The Property lies immediately north of the boundary between Selwyn Basin and 

MacDonald Platform, near the junction between the main body of Selwyn Basin and the easterly 

trending Meilleur River Embayment (Figure 7.1).  Eight, predominantly sedimentary units, ranging 

from Neoproterozoic to Lower Carboniferous, have been mapped in the area.  All of these units 

have been deformed with east-verging, asymmetric, north-trending folds related to easterly-

directed thrust faults (Figures 7.2 and 7.3).  Interpretation of the fold pattern indicates amplitudes 

of 500 to 2000 meters.  Northeasterly-trending normal faults are younger than the folds and thrust 

faults.  The period of compressional deformation started later than Early Triassic and ended 

before Late Eocene, based on evidence from adjacent map sheets (Pigage, 2008).  

 Table 7.1 shows the names, ages and general lithologies for the units that occur near the 

Property.  All of the known mineral occurrences on the Property lie within the Rabbitkettle

Formation.  Where present, argillaceous rocks typically exhibit pervasive axial-planar slaty 

cleavage.  

Figure 7.4 illustrates geology in and around the main areas of interest on the Property, 

along with the locations of the known mineral zones, all of which are located within or atop Unit 

ЄOR1, a sub-unit of the Rabbitkettle Formation.  Three (3) of the 4 main areas of interest occur 

within a north-trending syncline that is cored by Sunblood Formation.  The Mel Main Zone lies on 

the western, overturned limb of the syncline, while the Jeri and Jeri North Zones are on the eastern 

limb.  The exposure of the Unit ЄOR1 at the Mel East Zone could represent a second limestone 

horizon or a folded repeat or faulted-offset of the horizon observed at the Jeri and Jeri North 

Zones.  The faulted-offset option is favored by economic geologists who have worked on the 

Property. 

 On the Property, Unit ЄOR1 is up to 150 meters thick and consists of massive light grey 

to off-white, crypto-grained limestone that typically contains faint, white calcite and tan siderite 

veinlets.  It is sandwiched within a thicker section of Unit ЄOR wavy-banded, argillaceous 

limestone.  At the Mel Main Zone, Unit ЄOR1 is overlain by an up to 20 meter thick lens of 

mineralized rock, which is capped by a 10 to 45 meter thick layer of pale green to cream 

noncalcarous phyllite to mudstone.  The lensy phyllite/mudstone subunit is also present in the 

southern part of the Jeri Zone and at the Mel East Zone.  At the Jeri North Zone, Unit ЄOR1 is 

locally overlain by a mineralized chert horizon that lies at the base of a 30 meter thick section of 

Unit ЄOv basaltic flows and tuffs.

7.2 MINERALIZATION 

 Three (3) of the 4 zones of mineralization that have been identified on the Property occur 

within strata deposited directly atop Unit ЄOR1, while the fourth zone (Jeri Zone) is hosted mainly 

within hydrothermally altered rocks that are thought to be equivalent to the Unit ЄOR1 crypto-

grained limestone.  The Mel Main Zone is exposed within the western limb of the main syncline 

on the Property, while the Jeri and Jeri North are located 3 kilometers apart on the eastern limb 

of the syncline.  The Mel East Zone lies within a separate horizon of Unit ЄOR1 or a fold repeated 

or faulted-offset of the horizon that hosts the Jeri and Jeri North Zones.  Three (3) of the zinc-rich 

zones, the Mel Main, Jeri and Jeri North Zones, have been tested by drilling.   

 The zinc-lead-barite mineralization at the Mel Main Zone and zinc showings at the south-

end of the Jeri Zone and in the Mel East Zone, all occur within a stratigraphic sequence consisting 

of underlying Unit ЄOR1 crypto-grained limestone and overlying phyllite/mudstone subunit, which 

grades upward into Unit ЄOR wavy-banded argillaceous limestone.  The stratigraphic sequence 

hosting the Jeri North Zone is similar except that the mineralization occurs in a chert horizon, 

between the basal crypto-grained limestone unit and an overlying volcanic flow and volcaniclastic 

sequence that is capped by the wavy-banded argillaceous limestone.  The stratigraphic sections 

at the various zones are compared on Figure 7.5, and the zones are individually described in the 

following sub-sections. 

7.2.1 Mel Main Zone 

 At the Mel Main Zone, mineralization consists of coarse-grained sphalerite, galena and 

barite disseminated throughout a mixture of mudstone, silica and carbonate.  Minor amounts of 

fine-grained, sparsely disseminated pyrite occur locally, but overall, pyrite accounts for less than 

2% of the sulphides. 

 The Mel Main Zone is a disc-shaped and stratigraphically controlled body, which rests 

disconformably on unaltered crypto-grained limestone.  The mineralization is located on the 

steeply dipping, western limb of a major syncline and is slightly deformed by a secondary fold 

(Figure 6.5).  

 Trenching and diamond drilling have delineated the mineralized zone over a strike length 

of about 700 meters and from surface to a depth of 500 meters down dip.  The true thickness of 

the zone varies from less than 1 meter at each end to a maximum of 17.9 meters in the central 

portion.

 In the upper part of the zone, the central portion of the mineralized body consists of 

massive barite with moderate zinc and lead contents.  The highest grade zinc and lead values 

occur at the margins of the zone where it thins and barite content decreases.  The zone narrows 

at a depth of about 400 meters below surface and then widens again to form an hour-glass 

pattern.  Below 500 meters, the mineralized body appears to thicken again and there is 

corresponding increase in barite content.  The mineralized zone remains open to extension at 

depth (Figure 7.6). 

7.2.2 Jeri Zone  

 Mineralization at the Jeri Zone is atypical on the Property because it is hosted in altered, 

limestone considered to be the equivalent of the crypto-grained limestone, which underlines the 

Mel Main Zone.  The zinc mineralization in the Jeri Zone is, in part, discordant to bedding and is 

hosted in hydrothermal dolomite and silicified dolomite.  This type of strong footwall alteration is 

exposed along the eastern fold limb of the main syncline for a strike length of about 8 kilometers. 

 At the Jeri Zone, the footwall limestone is locally silicified, dolomitized, and brecciated at, 

and immediately beneath, the contact with the overlying phyllite/mudstone.  The altered and 

brecciated limestone commonly contains zinc minerals, smithsonite and sphalerite.  

Geochemically elevated lead values have been reported, but no economically significant lead 

mineralization has been identified.  Barite is present as a gangue mineral in quartz veins but does 

not appear to be sufficiently abundant to be economically important.  The presence of the zinc 

carbonate mineral, smithsonite, suggests that some zinc mineralization may be secondary.   

 Ten (10) holes totaling 1,009 meters have tested the Jeri Zone.  Nine of the holes, drilled 

over a strike length of 550 meters, intersected zinc mineralization.  Significant intersections of 

smithsonite and sphalerite from the drilling include 3.37 meters of 13.11% Zn in Hole J-85-1, 4.5 

meters of 7.96% Zn in Hole J-85-2 and 2 meters of 14.6% Zn in Hole J-85-4.  

Eleven (11) trenches were excavated across the Jeri Zone along a 2.5 kilometer segment 

of the favorable horizon.  Significant zinc values were obtained from: Trench No. 3, which assayed 

5.3% Zn over a sample width of 7 meters; Trench No. 4, which returned 10.5% Zn over a sample 

width of 5 meters; and, Trench No. 5, which returned 16.5% Zn over a sample width of 5 meters.  

The mineralization in trenches consisted of disseminated smithsonite and minor sphalerite hosted 

in silicified and dolomitized limestone.  The work conducted to date on the Jeri Zone is not 

sufficient to allow a resource estimate. 

About three kilometers of favorable stratigraphy between the Jeri and Jeri North Zones 

remains to be tested by trenching or drilling. 

7.2.3 Jeri North Zone 

 Geological mapping has traced the altered limestone horizon hosting the Jeri Zone for 8 

kilometers northward through the Jeri North Zone, where diamond drilling discovered zinc 

mineralization within an extensive chert horizon, which overlies cryptograined limestone and 



Page | 29  
 

underlies volcanic flows and tuffs.  The best drill results were from: Hole J-95-4, which intersected 

9.9% Zn over 5 meters (4.7 meters estimated true width); and, Hole J-95-5, which was drilled on 

the same section line and intersected 15.6% Zn over 5.1 meters (3.1 meters estimated true width) 

70 meters down dip from the J-95-4 intersection. 

 Sphalerite occurs mostly within the chert horizon but also occurs in lesser amounts within 

an overlying ash layer and underlying dolomitized limestone.  The sphalerite within the chert is 

very coarse grained where observed in drill core. 

 In 1996, additional drilling was completed in an attempt to expand the zone of zinc 

mineralization intersected in Holes J-95-4 and J-95-5.  One of these holes, J-96-10, was drilled 

on-strike 656.17 feet to the south of J-95-4 and intersected two intervals containing significant 

sphalerite.  One interval assayed 3.39% Zn over 2.1 meters of core length, and the other interval 

returned 12.38% Zn over 3.0 meters of core length.  However, holes that tested further down dip 

and on-strike of the above-mentioned intersections failed to encounter significant zinc 

mineralization, thus limiting the potential size of the known zone to about 400 meters in strike 

length and 100 meters down dip. 

 The discovery of zinc mineralization at the Jeri North Zone indicates there is potential for 

discovery of additional deposits of stratigraphically controlled zinc mineralization elsewhere along 

the east limb of the syncline on the Property. 

7.2.4 Mel East Zone 

 At the Mel East Zone, zinc mineralization occurs as smithsonite at the contact between 

crypto-grained limestone and wavy-banded limestone on a faulted-offset(?) segment of the 

eastern fold limb.  Three grab samples taken in 1981 from three separate small outcrops averaged 

9.6% Zn.  Subsequent soil sampling revealed a 1,400 meter long, zinc-in-soil geochemical 

anomaly that coincides with the projected surface trace of the mineralized contact.  No trenching 

or diamond drilling have been done at the Mel East Zone.  

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPE 

 The zinc-lead-barite mineralization at the Property differs somewhat from zone to zone 

and is difficult to definitively categorize as a specific deposit type.  The zones show certain 

characteristics that are consistent with carbonate replacement deposit ("CRD") model but also 

exhibits features common to sedimentary exhalite ("SEDEX") and karst/unconformity in-filling, 

Mississippi Valley-type ("MVT") deposits.  None of the deposit models is a perfect fit for any of 

the mineral zones on the Property.  The main characteristics of the CRD, SEDEX, and MVT 

models are briefly summarized in the following paragraphs.  

 CRD mineralization results from high-temperature alteration of limestone strata.  Most of 

these deposits contain pyritic ores with zinc-lead-silver as ubiquitous metals.  They are epigenetic 

and although stratabound, commonly exhibit discordant features (Titley, 1993).  Silicification is 

the primary alteration of the carbonate minerals in the host limestone, and barite is often present 



Page | 30  
 

in the ore assemblage.  Mines with CRD mineralization are common in the Cordillera of Mexico 

and southwestern USA.  The Silvertip deposit in northern British Columbia and the McMillian 

deposit in southeastern Yukon (Figure 7.1) are local examples of CRD mineralization.  

 SEDEX mineralization forms stratabound, tabular to lensoid beds of predominantly 

sulphide minerals that are deposited on the seafloor in basins near exhalative centers occurring 

along deep-seated faults or fracture zones acting as conduits for mineral-rich brines (Carne and 

Cathro, 1982).  Those deposits are mainly enriched in zinc, lead and silver and feature iron 

sulphides, sphalerite, galena and often barite interbedded with basinal sedimentary rocks.  Most 

SEDEX deposits are syngenetic and are hosted in reduced facies, fine-grained sedimentary rocks 

that consist predominantly of carbonaceous chert and shale (Goodfellow and Lydon, 2007).  

There are numerous large SEDEX deposits in Selwyn Basin of Yukon and northern British 

Columbia including the mines of the Faro district and the Howard's Pass, Tom, Jason and Cirque 

deposits (Figure 7.1).   

 MVT deposits contain low temperature, epigenetic, lead-zinc±silver minerals that occur 

with dolomite, calcite and quartz gangue as open space filling within platform carbonate 

sequences.  The mineralization is stratabound and mostly consists of galena, sphalerite, pyrite 

and marcasite.  Barite and fluorite are often present (Alldrick et al, 2005).  The Goz deposit on 

east-central Yukon and Robb Lake deposit in northern British Columbia are local examples of 

MVT mineralization (Figure 7.1).  

 The mineral zones at the Property are all stratabound and are hosted in a predominantly 

carbonate formation within a generally basinal sequence of rocks.  Galena-lead ratios from 

mineralization collected in the Mel Main and Jeri Zones are more radiogenic than those from 

material that define the Canadian Cordilleran shale curve (Godwin and Sinclair, 1982 and Godwin 

et al, 1988).  The galena-lead data for mineralization from the Property is consistent with 

Devonian-Mississippian deposition, which would make it an epigenetic event, because the host 

strata are Cambrian-Ordovician Rabbitkettle Formation.  This factor favors an CRD or MVT model 

for mineralization at the Property (Pigage, 2008).  Nelson and Colpron (2007) argue that there is 

a possible genetic link between SEDEX deposits formed in Selwyn Basin and MVT deposits found 

in adjacent carbonate platform sequences.  They suggest that both types of mineralization could 

be deposited from metal-enriched hydrothermal brines emanating from deep-seated extensional 

structures located along active boundaries between basinal and platform settings.   

9.0 EXPLORATION 

 Aside from aerial photographic surveys and Light Intensity Distance and Range (LIDAR) 

surveys, flown in summer and fall 2014 to document historical work areas, no exploration work 

was conducted on the Property by Silver Range.  These surveys were conducted to update the 

existing topographic data over the deposit area and potential access routes.   

Benz has recently acquired the Property and, as of the date of this report, has not yet conducted 

any exploration work or other studies. 



Page | 31  
 

10.0 DRILLING 

 No drilling was conducted on the Property by Silver Range, the prior owner, nor has any 

drilling been completed by Benz. 

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

 No sampling of soil or rock has been conducted on the Property by the, the prior owner, 

nor has any sampling been completed by Benz. 

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

 Geological and geotechnical logging of drill holes was recorded as hard copy and later 

transcribed into a digital data base on Excel spreadsheets.  The drill hole data base, includes drill 

collar coordinates, elevations of collars, down-hole survey data, rock types and assay data for all 

90 drill holes completed on the Property. 

 Visual comparison of hard copy and digital data was conducted on selected holes to 

ensure accuracy.  Any discrepancies identified were corrected. 

The author, H. Leo King, a qualified person, has been directly involved in managing 

exploration work at the Property since 1975.  The work included managing diamond drilling, 

trenching, geochemical soil sampling and geological mapping programs.  He has reviewed all 

technical information in the Company's files with respect to exploration work carried out on the 

Property.  In 2011 and 2012, he participated in compilation of digital files for all drilling carried out 

on the Property.   

The author believes that the historical data used in the compilation is adequate for the 

purposes of the mineral resource estimation that forms part of this Technical Report. 

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

 No metallurgical test processing or metallurgical testing has been carried out on samples 

from the Property by Silver Range, the prior owner, nor by Benz, the current owner.  Historical 

metallurgical testing on drill core from the Mel Main Zone is described in Section 6.2 of this 

Technical Report. 

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

14.1 INTRODUCTION  

At the request of Miloje Vicentijevic, President and CEO of Benz Mining Corp. ("Benz"), 

Giroux Consultants Ltd. was contracted to complete resource estimates on the Mel Main Deposit, 

located 80 kilometers east-northeast of Watson Lake and 47 kilometers north of the Alaska 

Highway in southeastern Yukon.  The resource was estimated by Gary Giroux, P.Eng. MASc., 

who is a qualified person and independent of Benz, based on the tests outlined in NI 43-101.    



Page | 32  
 

The data base supplied for this resource has an effective date of November 12, 2014 and 

contained information on 64 diamond drill holes.  A list of the drill holes used in the resource 

calculation is contained in Appendix I of this Technical Report.  Since the issue of the 2014 report, 

no drilling has been completed on the Property and therefore this resource is still current.  The 

zinc equivalent cut-off used for resource reporting has been adjusted to reflect current metal price 

forecasts. 

14.2 GEOLOGICAL SOLID  

At the Property, Cambrian to Ordovician marine sediments and similar age volcanic rocks 

host zinc-lead-barite mineralization.  The main host units are carbonate and clastic sediments 

that are broadly folded in a north-south trending, overturned syncline.  Four (4) sediment-hosted, 

zinc-rich zones have been identified on the Property: the Mel Main, Jeri, Jeri North and Mel East 

Zones. 

A geological solid for the Mel Main Zone (the "Mineralized Solid") was provided by Matthew 

Dumala, P.Eng. from Archer, Cathro & Associates (1981) Limited.  In addition, a Barite Shell solid 

that surrounds the Mineralized Solid in places, an overburden surface and a topographic surface 

were provided.   

Figures 14.1 and 14.2 show isometric views of the Mineralized Solid and Barite Shell, surface 

topography, overburden surface and drill hole traces.

14.3 DATA ANALYSIS 

Drill hole collars, down-hole surveys and assays for 64 drill holes were supplied for the 

Mel Main Zone resource estimate.  Two lead assays reported as <0.05% were replaced with 

values of 0.03%.  Eight (8) lead and zinc assays reported as <0.01% were replaced with values 

of 0.01%.  Two (2) lead assays reported at 0.00% were set to 0.01%.  Barium assays reported as 

not sampled were set to 0.01% in 2 cases.  Ten (10) barium assays reported as 0.00% were set 

to 0.01%.  A table of significantly mineralized intercepts appears in Appendix II of this Technical 

Report. 

There were 15 gaps within the from-to sequence that were filled with 0.01% for each 

variable.  

Spot checks were completed on 53% of the assays by comparing original assay 

certificates with the digital assays reported.  A total of 5 errors were found with most 2nd decimal 

errors.  This represents a 2% error rate which is reasonable. 

In 2012, 107 selected pieces of core were re-sampled by taking a ¼ core.  Holes sampled 

ranged from 87-4 to 94-48.  The results are compared in Table 14.1.

Dup. Ba (%) 107 27.29 13.67 0.03 51.81 0.50 

 

Scatter plots are shown for all variables in Figure 14.3.  In each case the best fit regression 

line is slightly below the equal value line.  For each variable, this is due to a few outliers where 

the second ¼ core sample was less than the original assay.  Since the duplicate sample was ½ 

the size of the original these few outliers are not unexpected.  In general, the duplicate assays 

match the originals very well and show no analytical bias. 

Drill holes were "passed through" the Mineralized Solid and Barite Shell with the 

intersections of drill holes with solids recorded.  Of the 64 supplied drill holes, 48 intersected the 

Mineralized Solid.  Data for all drill holes are shown in Appendices I and II of this Technical Report, 

with data for the 48 holes that intersected the Mineralized Solid at the Mel Main Zone highlighted.    

The assays were then back-tagged with a code for mineralized zone (MIN), barite 

envelope (BA) and waste assigned.  The domain interpretation was checked by comparing the 

domain boundaries with original assays.  Assay statistics for each of the three domains are shown 

in Table 14.2.

Zinc and lead in each of the three domains showed a strongly skewed distribution so 

lognormal cumulative frequency plots were used to determine if capping was necessary.  Barium 

in all domains showed a skewed arithmetic distribution, so arithmetic cumulative frequency plots 

were used.  

For zinc in the Mineralized Solid, a total of 6 overlapping lognormal populations were 

identified as shown on Figure 14.4 and tabulated in Table 14.3.  Population 1 was considered 

erratic outliers and a cap of 2 standard deviations above the mean of population 2 was used to 

cap 2 samples at 27.0 % Zn.

14.4 COMPOSITES 

The mineralized intervals in all drill holes ranged from a minimum of 1.3 meters to a 

maximum of 31.2 meter.  Within the Mineralized Solid, a composite length of 2.0 meters was 

selected to best represent the data.  Within the surrounding Barite Shell the sampled intervals 

ranged from a minimum of 0.15 meter to a maximum of 12.45 meter.  Within the Barite Shell, a 

composite length of 1.0 meter was used.  For external waste a composite length of 5 meter was 

used.  For all domains, down-hole composites were formed from boundary to boundary.  Samples 

less than ½ the composite length at the domain boundaries were combined with adjoining 

samples to produce a uniform support of Comp. Len. ± ½ Comp. Len. 

 

Of note, the entire drill core from an upper Mineralized Solid interval in drill hole 78-6 from 

22.75 to 44.50 and in drill hole 78-7 from 26.0 to 43.07 was shipped to Lakefield in March 1978 

for metallurgical tests.  These intervals were combined at Lakefield and a single assay was taken, 

which ran 3.87% Zn, 2.49% Pb and 30.3 % Ba.  These intervals had this average grade inserted 

for the estimation only.  As adding a constant grade for these 2 meter composites would add a 

level of continuity that does not exist, they were omitted from the variography.

14.5 VARIOGRAPHY  

Pairwise relative semivariograms for zinc, lead and barium were produced within the 

Mineralized Solid domain.  In each case anisotropy was demonstrated with the longest ranges 

along strike and down dip.  There were not enough pairs in the across dip direction to model so 

a nominal range was applied.  Nested spherical models were fit to each variable.  The nugget-to-

sill ratio for zinc and barium were a reasonable 33% and 35%, respectively.  The nugget-to-sill 

ratio for lead was quite high at 60% indicating higher sample variability for lead. 

For the Barite Shell domain, there were insufficient data points to model, so the 

semivariograms produced for the Mineralized Domain were applied. 

Within the external Waste Domain isotropic spherical nested models were fit to each 

variable. 

The semivariograms are attached as Appendix III of this Technical Report, and the 

parameters are summarized in Table 14.7.

14.6 BLOCK MODEL 

A block model with dimensions 10.0 meters N-S, 5.0 meters E-W and 5.0 meters vertical 

was superimposed over the domain solids.  For each block the percentage below surface 

topography, above the overburden-rock surface interface and within each of the Mineralized Solid 

and Barite Shell domains was recorded.  Material outside of the solids was coded as waste.  The 

block model origin was as follows. 

Lower Left corner of Model 

9920 East Size of column = 5 meters Number of columns = 67 

9600 North Size of row = 10 meters Number of rows = 66  

Top of Model 

965 Elevation Size of level = 5 meters Number of levels = 150 

No Rotation.

14.7 BULK DENSITY 

A total of 47 specific gravity determinations were made by ACME Analytical Laboratories 

Ltd. in 1994 from drill core pulps in holes 94-44 and 94-46 to 49.  The results are plotted below 

against the combined value of Pb + Zn + Ba% in the sample.  The correlation coefficient at 0.986 

is very good and a best fit polynomial regression line fits the data very well.  A specific gravity for 

each domain was calculated by using this regression equation and the estimated values for Pb, 

Zn and Ba% in each of the three domains.  A nominal specific gravity of 1.8 was applied to 

overburden.  The specific gravity for a given block was then a weighted average as shown below. 

SG_Block = (% Min * SG_Min) + (%BS * SG_BS) + (%Was * SG_Was) + (%OB * 1.8) 

% Below Topo 

 

It is recommended that future drill campaigns take regular specific gravity measurements 

on drill core from waste, barite envelope and mineralized zone material to test the relationship 

between grade and density.  Specific gravities from pulps measure the density of just the 

mineralization present and assume zero porosity.

14.8 GRADE INTERPOLATION 

Grades for zinc, lead and barium were interpolated into blocks using Ordinary Kriging.  

Kriging was completed on each domain independently using only the composites from the domain 

being estimated to prevent the smoothing of grades across domain contacts.  For each domain 

kriging was completed in a series of 4 passes with the search ellipsoid used in each pass oriented 

in the plane of the anisotropy with dimensions tied to the semi-variogram of the variable being 

estimated.  In the first pass the dimensions of the search ellipsoid were set to ¼ of the semi-

variogram range with a minimum of 4 composites required to estimate a block.  A maximum of 3 

composites were allowed from any given drill hole to ensure that a minimum of 2 drill holes were 

used to estimate a block.  For blocks not estimated in Pass 1 a second pass using ½ the semi-

variogram range was used.  A third pass at the full range and a fourth at twice the range completed 

the kriging exercise.  For all passes the maximum number of composites used was set at 12 and 

if more than 12 were found the closest 12 were used.  A fifth pass for both the mineralized solid 

and barite shell filled in some blanks by relaxing the minimum number of composites to 2 and 

setting the maximum number per hole to 4. 

The kriging parameters for zinc in each domain are tabulated below along with the number 

of blocks estimated in each pass.

While only material within the Mineralized Solid is reported for zinc and lead and only 

material within the Mineralized Solid and Barite Shell is reported for barite the waste was also 

estimated to allow for reasonable levels of dilution to be added when a mining plan is applied.

14.9 CLASSIFICATION 

Based on the study herein reported, delineated mineralization of the Mel Main Deposit is 

classified as a resource according to the following definitions from NI 43-101 and from CIM (2014): 

"In this Instrument, the terms "Mineral Resource", "Inferred Mineral Resource", "Indicated 

Mineral Resource" and "Measured Mineral Resource" have the meanings ascribed to 

those terms by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, as the CIM 

Definition Standards (May 2014) on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted by 

CIM Council, as those definitions may be amended." 

The terms Measured, Indicated and Inferred are defined by CIM (2014) as follows: 

"A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic 

interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are 

reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or 

quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, 

estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including 

sampling." 

"The term Mineral Resource covers mineralisation and natural material of intrinsic 

economic interest which has been identified and estimated through exploration and 

sampling and within which Mineral Reserves may subsequently be defined by the 

consideration and application of Modifying Factors.  The phrase 'reasonable prospects for 

economic extraction' implies a judgement by the Qualified Person in respect of the 

technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction.  

The Qualified Person should consider and clearly state the basis for determining that the 

material has reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. Assumptions should 

include estimates of cut-off grade and geological continuity at the selected cut-off, 

metallurgical recovery, smelter payments, commodity price or product value, mining and 

processing method and mining, processing and general and administrative costs. The 

Qualified Person should state if the assessment is based on any direct evidence and 

testing.  Interpretation of the word 'eventual' in this context may vary depending on the 

commodity or mineral involved. For example, for some coal, iron, potash deposits and 

other bulk minerals or commodities, it may be reasonable to envisage 'eventual economic 

extraction' as covering time periods in excess of 50 years. However, for many gold 

deposits, application of the concept would normally be restricted to perhaps 10 to 15 

years, and frequently to much shorter periods of time." 

Inferred Mineral Resource 

"An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 

grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. 

Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality 

continuity. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that 

applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral 



Page | 45  
 

Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could 

be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration." 

"An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is based on limited information and sampling gathered 

through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 

workings and drill holes. Inferred Mineral Resources must not be included in the economic 

analysis, production schedules, or estimated mine life in publicly disclosed Pre-Feasibility 

or Feasibility Studies, or in the Life of Mine plans and cash flow models of developed 

mines. Inferred Mineral Resources can only be used in economic studies as provided 

under NI 43-101." 

"There may be circumstances, where appropriate sampling, testing, and other 

measurements are sufficient to demonstrate data integrity, geological and grade/quality 

continuity of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource, however, quality assurance and 

quality control, or other information may not meet all industry norms for the disclosure of 

an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource. Under these circumstances, it may be 

reasonable for the Qualified Person to report an Inferred Mineral Resource if the Qualified 

Person has taken steps to verify the information meets the requirements of an Inferred 

Mineral Resource." 

Indicated Mineral Resource 

"An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 

grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient 

confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine 

planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is 

derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is 

sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of 

observation. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that 

applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable 

Mineral Reserve." 

"Mineralisation may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the Qualified 

Person when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such as to allow 

confident interpretation of the geological framework and to reasonably assume the 

continuity of mineralisation.  The Qualified Person must recognise the importance of the 

Indicated Mineral Resource category to the advancement of the feasibility of the project.  

An Indicated Mineral Resource estimate is of sufficient quality to support a Preliminary 

Feasibility Study which can serve as the basis for major development decisions." 

Measured Mineral Resource 

"A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 

grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with 

confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine 

planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence 



Page | 46  
 

is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to 

confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. A 

Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either 

an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource. It may be converted to a 

Proven Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve." 

"Mineralisation or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as a 

Measured Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity 

and distribution of data are such that the tonnage and grade or quality of the 

mineralisation can be estimated to within close limits and that variation from the estimate 

would not significantly affect potential economic viability of the deposit.  This category 

requires a high level of confidence in, and understanding of, the geology and controls of 

the mineral deposit." 

Modifying Factors 

"Modifying Factors are considerations used to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral 

Reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, 

infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental 

factors." 

 
Within the Mel Main Zone surface mapping and drill hole interpretation were used to 

establish the limits of the Mineralized Solid and hence geological continuity.  Grade continuity can 

be quantified by semi-variogram analysis.  By orienting the search ellipse in the directions of 

maximum continuity, as established by variography, the grade continuity can be utilized to classify 

the resource. 

For the Mel Main Zone the drill hole density is still too coarse to classify any blocks 

measured or indicated.  All blocks are classified as Inferred at this time. 

The resource is first presented using a zinc cut-off in Table 14.9.

As shown by the correlation matrix in section 14.3 there is poor correlation between all 

three variables.  This is also shown in Figure 14.7 where a long section shows zinc, lead and 

barium, each colour coded by estimated block grades within the Mineralized Solid.  Clearly the 

highest zinc areas are not necessarily the highest lead or barium areas.  As a result, using a zinc 

cut-off is not the best way to present the data.

The zinc-lead resource will most probably be an underground mining target while some of 

the barite might be accessible by open pit.  As a result, the resources are presented in two ways.  

A zinc equivalent can be determined as follows: 

 CIBC1 Long term price  Recovery (Lakefield, 1978)  Factor 

Zinc -  US$1.01/lb.     90.3 %    20.11 

Lead –  US$0.94/lb.    97.7 %    20.25 

Note 1 CIBC Global Mining Group Feb. 24, 2017 Long Term price forecast. 

 

ZnEQ = (Zn % x 20.11) + (Pb % x 20.25) 

20.11 

 

Note barium is not included in the Zn Equivalent due to possible different mining scenarios.  

The barite resource within both the Mineralized Solid and Barite Shell is presented separately 

with a barite cut-off and only above the 700 meters level as it is unlikely the material below this 

level would be economic. 

 At this time, no economic studies have been completed and an economic cut-off is 

unknown.  Assuming open pit mining costs of $3.50/t, underground mining costs of $65.00/t, 

processing costs (including G&A) of $27.00, downstream costs (transportation and treatment) of 

$44.50/t, metal prices of $1.01 for Zn & $0.94 for Pb and an exchange rate of 1.22 a reasonable 

ZnEQ cut-off might be 3.0 % for the open pit and 5.0 % for underground. 

This resource will have to be evaluated in a PEA at some point to determine how much of 

the resource could be mineable.

14.10 MODEL VERIFICATION 

 
The block model was verified in a number of ways.  First the composite values were 

statistically compared to the estimated blocks within the Mineralized Solid and Barite Shell.  The 

results shown below in Table 14.12 are reasonable considering the amount of data available.

Ba (%) 133 15.90 1.06 6,394 13.78 0.63 

 

Within the Mineralized Solid, a second test was made by re-estimating all blocks with 

some percentage of Mineralized Solid present using Inverse Distance Squared interpolation and 

a similar search strategy.  The results from 16,050 blocks showed at a zero cut-off the OK model 

contained 0.61% less pounds of zinc, 5.42% more pounds of lead and 3.9% less pounds of barium 

than the ID2 model. 

Finally, the estimated kriged grades were visually compared to composite grades on a 

series of east-west cross sections.  Four example sections are shown below as Figures 14.8 to 

14.11.  The results compared well with no bias indicated.

15.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY 

IMPACT 

 There are no known environmental, permitting, or title issues regarding the Property that 

may affect the mineral resource.  The government of Yukon is supportive of mining, which 

historically has had an important economic impact on the territory. 

 In March 2015, Silver Range completed a Heritage Resource Overview Assessment 

(HROA) for the Mel claims, however, a detailed field study was not completed (Kaufmann and 

Heffner, 2015).  It is recommended a Heritage Resources Impact Assessment (HRIA) be 

completed over areas identified as having elevated potential to contain heritage resources. 

 

16.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

 There are no known mineral occurrences or deposits within the immediate vicinity of the 

Property that are not covered by the mineral claims comprising the Property, and no claims, 

except the Property claims, are shown as currently in good standing on claim map 95D/06.   

 Banyan Gold Corp.'s, Hyland Gold project is located 19 km west of the Mel property and 

comprises sediment hosted, structurally controlled gold mineralization.  This mineralization is not 

representative of mineralization found on the Mel Property.   

17.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

 In September 2014 a barite marketing study was complted by World Industrial Minerals 

for Silver Range (Guilinger, 2014).

18.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 The Mel Main Zone is a zinc-lead-barite deposit hosted within Cambrian to Ordovician 

marine sediments.  Mapable units of carbonate and clastic sediments are broadly folded into a 

north-south trending, overturned syncline.  The Mel Main Zone occurs on the western limb of the 

syncline within a lensy stratigraphic horizon, which is underlain by crypto-grained limestone and 

overlain by a distinctive phyllite/mudstone unit that grades upward into wavy-banded, argillaceous 

limestone. 

 Diamond drilling at the Mel Main Zone has outlined an Inferred Mineral Resource 

estimated at 5,280,000 tonnes of 6.51% Zn, 1.86% Pb and 45,05% barite using a 5% Zn-

Equivalent cut-off.  In-fill drilling to up-grade the resource to an Indicated Mineral Resource is 

warranted.   

 The overturned and steeply dipping deposit is open to extension down dip, with potential 

for a significant increase in tonnage.  Three other zones of zinc-rich mineralization are also 

present on the Property, but no mineral resource estimates have been made for them.  

 The Jeri Zone is located about 4 kilometers northeast of the Mel Main Zone on the eastern 

limb of the same syncline that hosts the zinc-lead-barite mineralization at the Mel Main Zone.  At 

the Jeri Zone, unusually strong alteration of the footwall carbonate rocks to zinc-bearing, 

hydrothermal dolomite and silicified dolomite has been exposed for several kilometers along the 

fold limb. 

 The Jeri Zone has been tested by trenching and diamond drilling over a strike length of 

550 meters.  The drilling has intersected encouraging zinc values, including 13.11% Zn over 3.37 

meters, within the larger zone of silicified and dolomitized limestone. 

 Trenching at the Jeri Zone has exposed smithsonite and minor sphalerite mineralization 

over widths of 5 meters to 7 meters.  Sampling has yielded high zinc values in 3 of 10 trenches, 

with mineralized exposures grading from 5.3% Zn over a sample width of 7 meters to 16.5% Zn 

over a sample width of 5 meters. 

 There is potential for the discovery of additional zinc mineralization within the thick 

dolomitized section of limestone that hosts the Jeri Zone.  An untested geophysical anomaly at 

the south end of the Jeri Zone, interpreted to be located at the base of the dolomitized limestone, 

represents a particularly attractive drill target. 

 The Jeri North Zone lies 3 kilometers north of the Jeri Zone on the eastern limb of the 

same syncline that hosts the Mel Main Zone.  At the Jeri North Zone, coarse-grained sphalerite 

occurs within a chert unit below a volcanic flow and volcaniclastic sequence that grades upwards 

into wavy-banded limestone.  This mineralized chert unit rests on the same crypto-grained 

limestone that forms the base of the Mel Main Zone.  The chert and volcanic sequence seen at 

the Jeri North Zone is not present at the Mel Main and Jeri Zones. 



Page | 58  
 

 Diamond drilling at the Jeri North Zone resulted in the discovery of promising zinc 

mineralization.  One hole intersected 9.9% Zn over a core length of 5 meters and another hole, 

drilled deeper on the same section, intersected 15.6% Zn over a core length of 5.1 meters.  

Although additional drilling on the Jeri North Zone did not extend the zone of zinc mineralization 

beyond an estimated 400 meters of strike extent, there is significant potential within untested 

portions of the favorable horizon. 

 Geological mapping, trenching, geophysical and geochemical surveys and diamond 

drilling at the Jeri and Jeri North Zones have traced the favorable zinc-bearing horizon along the 

east limb of the syncline for a length of 8 kilometers.  Additional drilling is warranted to evaluate 

several untested targets. 

 The Mel East Zone is another showing of zinc mineralization, located 3 kilometers 

northeast of the Jeri Zone.  It is believed to be hosted in a faulted-offset of the same stratigraphic 

sequence that hosts the Mel Main, Jeri and Jeri North Zones.  The Mel East Zone has not been 

trenched or drilled.  Anomalous zinc-lead soil geochemistry and a coincident IP anomaly have 

defined a drill target. 

 The mineralized zones on the Property have been variously categorized as carbonate-

replacement, sedimentary exhalative and unconformity or karst-related.  Although the zones 

exhibit certain characteristics that are consistent with each of these deposit types, they also show 

features that are inconsistent with each deposit type.  Regardless, the mineralization occurs in a 

predictable stratigraphic setting, which has made historical exploration successful and will help 

guide future work.   

 Exploration conducted to date at the Mel Main Zone has defined a mineral resource of 

potential economic interest, and historical metallurgical test work has produced encouraging 

results.  Further work on the Mel Main, Jeri, Jeri North and Mel East Zones is warranted. 

As of the effective date of this report, the Author is not aware of any risks and uncertainties that 

could affect the project's potential economic viability.

19.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

At a minimum two phases of exploration are proposed at the Mel Property.  Both phases 

could potential be expanded with the allocation of additional expenditures depending on the 

results obtained during these initial programs. 

19.1 Phase I 

The objectives of the Phase I exploration work include: 

 

• Trace the on-strike extensions of the Mel Main zone 

• Trace the on-strike extension of the Jeri and Jeri North mineralization, specifically in 

the 3.0 km interval between these two zones 

• Identify potential drill targets along the strike extensions of the Mel Main and Jeri to 

Jeri North mineralizes trends 

 

The principal exploration activities required to achieve these objectives include 

mapping, trenching and soil and rock sampling.  Mapping and soil geochemical sampling 

will be conducted along strike of the Mel Main and between the Jeri and Jeri North zones.  

In the case of the Mel strike extensions, surface conditions are more favourable for tracing 

this zone to the north; to the south swampy ground may make this more challenging and 

drilling may be the only way to trace Mel Main. Where suitable strategically placed 

trenches, utilizing a helicopter portable CANDIG excavator, will be undertaken for the Mel 

Main strike extensions. Ground conditions are favourable for a systematic trenching 

program between Jeri and Jeri North with initial trenching to be spaced approximately 

200m apart.  Trenches are expected to be between 50 to 75 m long. Rock sampling of 

visible mineralization and associated alteration will be undertaken where encountered in 

trenches and outcrop exposures for all areas.  

 

A budget for the above-mentioned Phase I Program is estimated at $149,820 as 

presented in Table 20.1.  It is estimated that the program would take 20 days to complete.

19.2 Phase II 

Principal Objectives: 
 

 Mel Main Zone - test targets that have potential to increase the current Inferred 
Resource.   

 Mel Main Zone - confirm continuity of mineralized grades and widths in the upper 
portion of the Inferred Resource. 

 
Additional Objectives: 
 

 Jeri and Jeri North zones 
 Define in detail the lateral extent of any mineralization identified from the Phase I 

trenching program; 
 Explore for mineralization along the immediate 2.0 km strike direction to the north 

of Jeri North 
 Identify potential drill targets for future testing based on trenching results. 

 Complete the Heritage Resources Impact Assessment initiated by Silver Range for 
the Property Holdings as part of the ongoing permitting requirements. 

 
Activities: 
 
Mel Main Zone 
 

Diamond drilling will be the main activity to test targets that could potentially 
increase the resource.  Areas with potential to increase the resource include on-strike 
extensions to the north and south of the Mel Main Zone and extension of the current 
Inferred Resource at depth.  Final diamond drill hole locations will be determined during 
site surveys and mapping completed during Phase I. 
 
Drilling recommendations include: 
 

 Step-out drilling along the northern strike projection of the Mel Main Zone.  Ground 
conditions appear more permissive in this direction for relatively shallow holes.  
Approximately 600 m of drilling are recommended in four to six holes. 

 Ground conditions (presence of swamps) make tracing the south strike projection of 
the Mel Main Zone difficult using trenching, consequently drilling appears as the only 
way to test this area.  Two to four holes are recommended to test this southern 
extension for a minimum of 400 m and a maximum of 800 m of drilling. Drilling and 
placement of the third and fourth holes will depend on the results of the first two step-
out holes. 

 Two to four drill holes are recommended to test the projected depth extension of Mel 
Main mineralization below the current limits of the Inferred Resource. If results for the 
first two holes are positive, then the second two holes should be completed to help 
define the grade and size potential of this extension of the mineralization. The total 
anticipated drill meterage is approximately 2700 m. 

 Complete five confirmation drill holes within the upper 200 m of the current Inferred 
Resource for a total of approximately 750 m of drilling. The main idea is to test the 
grade and width continuity of the mineralization. 

 



Page | 62  
 

Multi-element analysis of the mineralization should be undertaken on 
strategically selected samples. This type of information is useful for exploration, 
metallurgical evaluations and environmental assessments. 
 
Jeri and Jeri North 
 

The recommended work plan for Jeri and Jeri N includes additional trenching, 
mapping and rock sampling, as follows. 
 

Recommendations to follow-up mineralization identified in the 3.0 km interval 
between Jeri and Jeri North from the Phase I trenching program include: 
 

 In-fill trenching spaced 100m apart to define the lateral limits of mineralization found 
during Phase I trenching. Rock sampling of exposed mineralization. An estimate 250 
to 300 m of in-fill trenching is anticipated. 

 Selection of drill targets will be based on the trench results. 
 

Prior surface mapping and continuity of the prospective stratigraphic package 
suggests that the northern strike extension of the Jeri North Zone warrants additional 
exploration.  A work proposal is recommended to explore for mineralization for 
approximately 2.0 km north on strike from Jeri North. Field activities would consist 
primarily of geological mapping, surface trenching and rock sampling.  Initial trenching to 
be spaced approximately 200 m apart with trenches anticipated to be 50 to 75 m long; 
work progress is expected to be one trench per day. An estimated 300 to 500 m of 
trenching is anticipated for this program. Rock sampling of visible mineralization and 
associated alteration will be undertaken where encountered in trenches and outcrop 
exposures. 
 
Heritage Studies 
 

A Heritage Resources Impact Assessment (HRIA) is required under the terms of 
the exploration work permit and is a follow-up on the Heritage Resource Overview 
Assessment (HROA) completed by Silver Range in 2015. It is recommended an HRIA 
be completed over areas previously identified as having elevated potential to contain 
heritage resources.  An HRIA requires on-site field work by a qualified contractor. 
 
Duration of Recommended Phase II Program 
 

Phase II field exploration activities are anticipated to take approximately seven 

weeks.  Mobilization of equipment and materials will be done in advance of the Phase II 

field program.   A report of results will be prepared after receipt of all analytical and assay 

data following the Phase II program.  A budget for the above-mentioned Phase II Program 

is estimated at $1,831,500 as presented in Table 20.2.
