1.0 Executive Summary 

The 4,157 hectare Rude Creek Gold Project (the "Project") is located at latitude 62°40'N 
and longitude 13835'W on NTS map sheet 115J/10, west-central Yukon. It lies 
approximately 160 km south of Dawson City and 135 km northwest of Carmacks, which 
are 538 km and 177 km, respectively, by paved highway north of Whitehorse, Yukon 
Territory. Access is by helicopter, but fixed wing aircraft access can be utilized to the 
Rude Creek airstrip on the Project for staging purposes and the Casino winter road 
passes through the Project. The Project, which comprises 204 Royal, Ann and Poker 
claims within the Whitehorse Mining district, is bisected by Rude Creek within the 
Dawson Range of the unglaciated portion of the Yukon Plateau. The claims are 100% 
owned by 0890763 BC Ltd., subject to an option agreement with Michelin Mining Corp. 
("Michelin") and two separate underlying net smelter return royalties. This report was 
prepared to support listing requirements of the Canadian Securities Exchange by 
Michelin. 

Regionally the Project is located within the Dawson Range gold district, 45 km 
southeast of Goldcorp Inc.'s Coffee orogenic type gold deposit and 80 km south-
southeast of the recent Vertigo discovery and 72 km southeast of the Golden Saddle 
deposit, both orogenic type gold systems owned by White Gold Corp. Orogenic gold 
mineralization within both districts is preferentially hosted in competent lithologies (e.g. 
Paleozoic metamorphic basement rocks and younger intrusions) with a strong structural 
control. Gold mineralization within the White Gold district, which lies just to the north of 
the Dawson Range gold district, typically exhibits an older, Jurassic age compared to 
the Cretaceous ages typical within the Dawson Range. The orogenic type gold 
mineralization at Coffee has recently been dated at 97 to 92 Ma slightly younger than 
the Mid Cretaceous (99.5 ±0.9 Ma) Coffee Creek pluton (Whitehorse plutonic suite of 
the Dawson Range batholith), which hosts some of the mineralization. 

The Rude Creek Gold Project is almost entirely underlain by generally equigranular 
granitic rocks of the Dawson Range phase of the Mid Cretaceous Whitehorse plutonic 
suite, which is intruded by a plug and related dykes and/or sills of the early Late 
Cretaceous Casino plutonic suite, at the headwaters of Rude and Trombley Creeks, and 
by part of the late Late Cretaceous Mt. Cockfield stock of the Prospector Mountain suite 
in the southeastern property area.   

The northeast trending apparent sinistral strike slip Dip Creek fault lies just west of the 
Project and a northerly trending normal fault, east side down, borders the eastern 
property boundary. A number of northwest trending faults appear to dissect the Project 
with some east-northeast to northeast trending cross structures. The Northwest trending 
Koe shear zone, which hosts gold-silver-antimony-arsenic bearing chalcedonic, drusy 
and massive quartz veins and clay-sericite-pyrite alteration approximately 8 km to the 
southeast, may also extend through the Project.

Documented historical exploration on the Project area, undertaken from 1922 to 1995, 
concentrated on base metal bearing veins (the Rude Creek silver-lead-zinc fissure vein 
showing) and porphyry copper exploration. Exploration has included a 22m adit and 
minor trenching on the Rude Creek showing, minor prospecting, mapping, and stream 
sediment, with minor soil and rock, geochemistry. 

Following the discovery of Fort Knox and then Pogo in Alaska in the 1990's, exploration 
in the region focused on gold. The Geological Survey of Canada released results from a 
stream sediment survey in 1986 indicating highly anomalous gold (300 ppb) 
accompanied by anomalous arsenic, tungsten and antimony from Trombley Creek, a 
tributary of Rude Creek. The headwaters was staked in 1999 by Prime Properties 
Syndicate and optioned to Prospector International Resources Inc. Exploration on the 
area of the Rude Creek Gold Project from 1999 to 2011 by various owners and 
operators consisted of a property wide helicopter-borne magnetic and radiometric 
geophysical survey, the collection of 587, primarily contour, soils, and minor prospecting 
and mapping.  

The current Rude Creek Gold Project was acquired in 2010 to 2014 by 0890763 BC 
Ltd., which has completed: a property wide high resolution fixed wing aerial 
photographic survey; 496 grid and lesser contour soil samples; and 2.49 km of IP 
geophysics, 219.5m of rotary air blast drilling in 3 holes and 504.5m of reverse 
circulation drilling in 5 holes on the Trombley soil anomaly. Total soil coverage across 
the property is only about 15%. 

Two significant gold soil anomalies were delineated on the Project with associated 
anomalous bismuth, ±tellurium, and peripheral arsenic, silver, ±antimony and lead. The 
Trombley anomaly covers an apparently easterly trending 150m by 350m, 
discontinuous to 550m (due to talus cover), >38 ppb Au soil anomaly underlain by 
locally tourmaline bearing and chloritized, biotite-hornblende granodiorite. Drilling of the 
soil anomaly, with a total of 723.9m of percussion drilling in 8 holes intersected two 
north trending structures returning 0.53 g/t Au over 13.4m including 0.63 g/t Au over 
6.1m and 2.14 g/t Au over 1.5m in hole ROYRC17-05 and 0.52 g/t Au over 4.57m 
including 1.17 g/t Au over 1.5m in ROYRC18-07.

The best gold grades are coincident with sericite altered granodiorite with about 5 to 
10% limonite after pyrite, ±pyrite and arsenopyrite, and minor fine quartz ±carbonate 
veining. Both the soil grid and most of the drilling were not favourably oriented or 
positioned to intersect north trending structures. The gold soil anomaly and gold bearing 
structures remain open to the north, south and somewhat to the east, as well as down 
dip. 

Multiple northerly gold in soil anomalous trends are evident in the Northeast zone, with 
at least five distinct, linear, 800m long gold anomalies over the 1.5 km wide grid, open in 
all directions. The Northeast zone also appears to be underlain by biotite-hornblende 
granodiorite, intruded by a variety of dykes of the Casino and Prospector Mountain 



4

suites. Extensive pyrite (up to 15%) and trace chalcopyrite were noted associated with 
dykes in an outcrop at the western end of the zone.  

The deposit model for the Rude Creek Gold Project is the orogenic type, such as at 
Goldcorp's Coffee deposit, and at the Golden Saddle and VG deposits and the newly 
discovered Vertigo zone of White Gold Corp. The Coffee deposit is hosted by 
metamorphosed Paleozoic basement rocks of the Yukon-Tanana terrane and the mid 
Cretaceous Coffee Creek pluton, of the Whitehorse plutonic suite, with a strong 
structural control. Northerly and easterly trends dominate. Strong similarities exist 
between the Rude Creek Gold Project and the Coffee deposit as follows: both are 
located within the Dawson Range gold district and are, at least in part, hosted by 
phases of the Whitehorse plutonic suite; north trends dominate at the Supremo zone 
within the Coffee deposit and have been intersected in drilling at the Trombley zone and 
are suggested by trends within the Northeast gold soil anomaly on the Rude Creek Gold 
Project; a strong structural control is indicated at both; and there is a similarity in the 
size, shape and tenor of the gold in soil anomalies. 

The Rude Creek Gold Project constitutes a property of merit based on: favourable 
geological setting (Dawson Range gold district); competent host rocks (Whitehorse 
plutonic suite of the Dawson Range batholith); structural complexity (evident within the 
airborne magnetic data, resistivity/induced polarization data and presence of linear 
younger dykes); significant gold soil anomalies with associated bismuth, ±tellurium, and 
peripheral arsenic, silver, ±antimony and lead; significant initial drill intercepts on the 
Trombley zone despite limited drilling, and similarities and proximity to Goldcorp's 
Coffee deposit and other significant gold discoveries within the Dawson Range and 
White gold districts. 

A two phase exploration program is recommended with a Phase 1 budget of $120,000, 
consisting of: additional grid soil sampling in the Northeast and Trombley areas; and 
detailed mapping, prospecting and structural analysis including a detailed integration and 
interpretation of the airborne geophysical data. Contingent on results from Phase 1, a 
$275,000 Phase 2 RC drill budget is proposed to follow up significant anomalies with 
1000m of RC drilling in 5 to 6 holes.

2.0    INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

2.1      Qualified Person, Participating Personnel and Scope 

Ms. Jean M. Pautler, P.Geo. of JP Exploration Services Inc. ("JPEx"), was 
commissioned by Michelin Mining Corp., a company duly incorporated under the laws of 
the Province of British Columbia, to examine and evaluate the geology and mineral 
potential of the Rude Creek Gold Project (consisting of the Royal, Ann and Poker 
claims) and to make recommendations for the next phase of exploration work in order to 
test the resource potential of the property. Based on the literature review and property 
examination recommendations are made for the next phase of exploration work. An 
estimate of costs has been made based on current rates for trenching, soil and 
geophysical surveys, drilling and professional fees in the Yukon Territory. This report 
describes the geology, history, mineral potential of the Rude Creek Gold Project and 
recent exploration by 0890763 BC Ltd., and was prepared to support listing 
requirements of the Canadian Securities Exchange by Michelin Mining Corp.  

Regional geological data and current exploration information have been reviewed to 
determine the geological setting of the mineralization and to obtain an indication of the 
level of industry activity in the area. 

The report describes the property in accordance with the guidelines specified in 
National Instrument 43-101 and is based on historical information, a review of recent 
exploration in the area, a site visit on the property by the author on January 17, 2019 on 
behalf of Michelin at which time most drill sites and select induced polarization lines 
were examined and a review of the RC chips on February 14, 2019, which are stored at 
the Bostock core library in Whitehorse. Work by 0890763 BC Ltd. consisted of: a 
property wide high resolution fixed wing aerial photographic survey; 496 grid and lesser 
contour soil samples; and 2.49 km of IP geophysics, 219.5m of rotary air blast ("RAB") 
drilling in 3 holes and 504.5m of RC drilling in 5 holes on the Trombley soil anomaly. 

The soil geochemical, ground geophysical, aerial photography and RAB drill surveys, 
between 2014 and 2016 were completed by GroundTruth Exploration Inc. 
("GroundTruth"), a highly experienced private mineral exploration consulting firm based 
in Dawson City, Yukon.

The Rude Creek Gold Project is located within the Traditional Territory of the Selkirk
First Nation. The First Nation has settled their land claims, with no First Nation 
settlement land within the Project area. A large parcel of First Nations surveyed 
Category A land (SFN R-12A), with surface and subsurface rights, adjoins the 
southeastern Project area, covering Mt. Cockfield. No significant First Nation or other 
concerns are anticipated. The land in which the mineral claims are situated is Crown 
Land and the mineral claims fall under the jurisdiction of the Yukon Government. 
Surface rights would have to be obtained from the government if the property were to go 
into development.

A mineral claim holder is required to perform assessment work and is required to 
document this work to maintain the title as outlined in the regulations of the Yukon 
Quartz Mining Act. The amount of work required is equivalent to $100.00 of assessment 
work per quartz claim unit per year. Alternatively, the claim holder may pay the 
equivalent amount per claim unit per year to the Yukon Government as "Cash in Lieu" to 
maintain title to the claims. 

Preliminary exploration activities do not require permitting, but significant drilling, 
trenching, blasting, cut lines, and excavating may require a Mining Land Use Permit that 
must be approved under the Yukon Environmental Socioeconomic Assessment Act 
(YESSA). A Class I notification (number C1Q00086) is currently in place for the Project 
and valid to June 7, 2019, but is not required within the Project area. Additional 
notification and permits will be applied for as needed. To the author's knowledge, the 
Rude Creek Gold Project area is not subject to any environmental liability. 

Active placer claims, owned by Andre Fournier, extend along Rude Creek (Figure 15), 
but do not impact exploration on the mineral claims. 

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY  (Figures 1 to 2) 

5.1 Access, Local Resources and Infrastructure (Figures 1 to 2) 

The Project is accessible via helicopter from Dawson City, 160 km to the north, or 
seasonally from Carmacks, 135 km to the southeast (Figure 1). Dawson City and 
Carmacks are accessed by year-round highway approximately 538 km and 175 km, 
respectively, north of Whitehorse, Yukon. Daily flight service is available from 
Whitehorse to Dawson City. The Minto airstrip, 75 km north of Carmacks lies 87 km to 
the east-southeast of the property. 

The Project also lies 75 km northwest of the Nucleus deposit, which lies near the end of 
the Freegold road, about 82 km by road from Carmacks. The 126 km long Casino winter 
road extends from here through the Sonora Gulch property to the Casino deposit, 
passing through the Project area, along Rude Creek. The Sonora Gulch - Casino 
portion was reportedly used in 2010 by Western Copper. An upgrade of the Casino 
winter road and Freegold road is part of the Yukon Resource Gateway project designed 



14

to provide infrastructure to resources and is being funded by the Yukon and Federal 
governments, scheduled to be completed by 2025.  

Access is also available by fixed wing aircraft to the 650m long Rude Creek airstrip on 
the Poker 56 claim at approximately 620150mE, 6951750mN, Nad 83, Zone 7 (Figure 
2). A local road connects the airstrip, which is being maintained by the local placer 
miner, to the placer camp, about 1.3 km upstream. 

Water is primarily available from Rude Creek, which bisects the property, and its 
tributaries, as well as from other westerly flowing tributaries of Dip Creek. The creeks 
generally flow from May until October. 

Dawson City is the closest town of significant size, with a population of approximately 
2020, but draws some 60,000 visitors each year. Facilities include an airport (with 
regular air service from Whitehorse, Yukon Territory and Fairbanks, Alaska), fixed wing 
aircraft bases, two helicopter bases, a hospital, police station, service stations, two 
grocery stores, accommodation and restaurants. Industrial services include tire repair, 
propane sales, welding and machine shops, heavy equipment repair and rental, a 
lumber mill, and freight and trucking companies. Heavy equipment and a mining 
oriented labour force are available for contract exploration and mining work. Main 
industries are tourism and gold mining. More complete facilities and a larger mining 
oriented labour force are available in Whitehorse. 

Carmacks has a population of approximately 500, a seasonal helicopter base (Trans 
North Helicopters), and a gravel airstrip suitable for medium sized aircraft, but no 
aircraft base. Facilities include a grocery store, nursing station, police station, two 
service stations, accommodation, a restaurant and a café. Some heavy equipment is 
available for contract mining work. Whitehorse lies less than two hours by paved 
highway to the south.  

5.2     Physiography, Climate and Infrastructure (Figures 1 to 2) 

The Project is situated near the eastern margin, but within, the unglaciated portion of 
the Yukon Plateau in the Dawson Range of west-central Yukon (Figures 1 to 2). Local 
alpine glaciation occurred at Mt. Cockfield with evidence of a lobe, having extended 
along upper Victor Creek, at the southern margin of the Project. The topography is 
characterized by broad ridges, convex slopes and v-shaped valleys. The soil is 
dominated by colluvium, with weathered bedrock locally on the ridges, and permafrost is 
widespread but discontinuous, primarily on north facing slopes (Bond and Lipovsky, 
2012).

The Project area is drained by westerly flowing tributaries of Dip Creek, including Rude 
Creek, which bisects the property, and Victor Creek. Dip Creek flows into the Klotassin 
River to the Donjek, White, then into the Yukon River. The north and eastern Project 
area is drained by Battle Creek, which flows northerly into the Selwyn River and thence 
into the Yukon River. Elevation ranges from about 2,480 feet along Rude Creek to just 
over 5,400 feet above sea level on peaks in the northeastern property area (Figure 2).  



15

Vegetation is typical boreal forest consisting of white spruce, birch and poplar on well-
drained slopes and black spruce on poorly drained frozen north facing slopes with 
moss, talus and felsenmeer at higher elevations. Outcrop is commonly found as tors on 
ridgetops and as local exposures along creeks. 

The area has a northern interior climate characterized by a wide temperature range with 
warm summers, long cold winters and moderate precipitation. Summers are warm, with 
daily averages in July of about 20°C dropping to 8°C at night. Winters are cold, with 
January temperatures of -20°C during the day, dropping to -30°C overnight and -45°C is 
not uncommon. Annual precipitation is moderate with much of it as snow. The 
exploration season lasts from late May until October. 

Although there do not appear to be any topographic or physiographic impediments, and 
suitable lands appear to be available for a potential mine, including mill, tailings storage, 
heap leach and waste disposal sites, engineering studies have not been undertaken 
and there is no guarantee that areas for potential mine waste disposal, heap leach 
pads, or areas for processing plants will be available within the subject property. The 
nearest source of hydro-electric power is Minto. 

6.0 HISTORY (Figures 2, 3 and 15) 

The Rude Creek Gold Project covers the Haxe anomaly and Rude Creek showing, both 
documented as silver-lead-zinc+/-gold polymetallic vein occurrences (Minfile Numbers 
115J 020 and 021) by the Yukon Geological Survey (Deklerk, 2009 and 
http://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/) (Figures 2 and 15).

Documented historical exploration on the Project area, undertaken from 1922 to 1995, 
focused on base metal bearing veins and copper porphyry exploration and has included 
a 22m adit, minor trenching, prospecting, mapping and stream sediment, with minor soil 
and rock geochemistry. One old cat trench (1981) was found along the ridge, about 2 
km west of the Trombley zone. 

Placer mining on Rude Creek has been sporadic. It commenced in 1915 until the 
1920's, recommenced in 1933 to 1954, during 1980 and 1981, again from 1987 to 1991 
and once more in 2010, generally continuing to present. Reported placer gold 
production from 1978 to 2017 on Rude Creek is 5,286 crude ounces (Jeffrey Bond, 
personal communication, 2019). Current placer claims are shown on Figure 15. Gold in 
Rude Creek is reported to be flaky and bright with small nuggets, and a purity of 840 to 
860 fine (Kreft, 1994). Minor amounts of bismuth and scheelite (calcium tungstate), and 
significant amounts of magnetite and galena are also reported. 

A summary of the historical work completed by various operators on the Rude Creek 
Project (unless stated otherwise) as documented in Yukon Minfile (Government of 
Yukon, 2018), various government publications of the Yukon Geological Survey or its 
predecessor (Mineral Industry Reports and Yukon Exploration and Geology) and the 
Geological Survey of Canada, and company publications (primarily available as 
assessment reports filed with the government), is tabulated below. The locations of the 

http://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/


16

occurrences, known mineralized zones and important natural features are shown in 
Figures 2, 3, and 15 in relation to the outside property boundaries.  

Rude Creek showing: 

1915  An outcrop containing galena was discovered along Rude Creek during placer activity, 
but no work is documented at this time (Deklerk, 2009).

1921-4  The showing was restaked and explored by hand trenching and a 21.9m adit on the 
south side of the creek in 1922 to 1924. The showing consists of a 4.26m long and up 
to 1m wide, easterly trending carbonate (possible siderite) fissure vein mineralized with 
galena-sphalerite-pyrite returning, 0.34 g/t Au, 4198 g/t Ag and 37% Pb over 11 cm 
(Cockfield, 1927).

1947-53 The showing was restaked and explored by trenching but no results are documented 
(Deklerk, 2009). Four long trenches were later observed above the adit on the south 
side of the creek by Nordex Explorations Ltd. ("Nordex"). 

1965-6 Nordex visited and confirmed the grade of mineralization at the showing by sampling 
the dump (following restaking by prospectors Meloy and Proctor) and acquired the 
claims due to the discovery of significant silver-lead-zinc polymetallic veins at the 
Bomber showing (about 2 km south of Casino). Nordex subsequently staked additional 
claims and explored by silt sampling with about 66 samples (analyzed for Cu, Pb and 
Zn) on or draining the current Project area (Taylor, 1966). No significant silt results 
were obtained, but a northwest trending fault (Figure 4), thought to be associated with 
veins further northwest, was interpreted from airborne geophysical data to follow Jens 
Creek (Taylor, 1966). Polymetallic veins commonly occur peripheral to porphyry copper 
±molybdenum-gold deposits. 

This appears to be the origin of the Haxe Minfile anomaly, but no lead and zinc 
anomalies were found and the actual polymetallic vein exposures mentioned refer to 
the Rude Creek and Vic showings. The Haxe Minfile area was actually staked as a 
porphyry copper target as discussed below. 

1980-1 W.J. Crawford performed stripping and trenching in 1980 and 1981 on claims staked 
over the Rude Creek showing area, in conjunction with nearby gold placer mining 
(Deklerk, 2009). A bulldozer trench, observed along the ridge at 621667mE, 
6950428mN by Boomerang in 2011, was probably completed at this time to explore for 
the southern extent of the silver-lead-zinc fissure vein. A point silver soil anomaly 
occurs here, but no anomalous rock geochemistry was obtained (Andersen, 2011).  

Following the discovery of the Casino porphyry copper deposit in the late 1960's, 15 km 
northwest of the Project, work in the Dawson Range was aimed at porphyry copper 
exploration, with a small and poorly mineralized porphyry copper-molybdenum showing 
found 5 km southeast of the central Rude Creek Project (Mt. Cockfield, Minfile Number 
115J 017). Drilling of 1479.5m in 6 holes in 1970 averaged about 0.03% Cu and 0.013% 
Mo, associated with the Mt. Cockfield stock (Deklerk, 2009). Consequently a number of 
porphyry copper directed programs were completed over the Project area.  

1969-70 The current Trombley zone (Haxe Minfile area) was staked as the Axe and the 
headwaters to the east as the Hill claims by Montana Mines Ltd., which collected minor 
reconnaissance rock and 28 soil samples, analyzed for Cu, Pb, Zn, and Mo (Fulcher, 
1971). They reported anomalous peak values of 384 ppm Cu and 10 ppm Mo in soil 



17

associated with pyritic fractures in granite over a 250m length in the extreme eastern 
Project area, bordering SFN R-12A (Figure 2). 

1969-72 Newmont Mining Corporation completed stream sediment sampling in the Project area 
(analyzed for Cu, Mo and Zn) and staked the Co claims to the east of the current 
Project area. Follow up soils, a ground magnetic survey (Dolan and Costin, 1970) and 
drilling led to the discovery of the Mt. Cockfield porphyry copper-molybdenum showing 
which is covered by SFN R-12A (Figure 2).  

1970 A stream sediment survey conducted for Nickel Hill Mines Ltd., and Pathfinder 
Resources Ltd. by Alrae Engineering Ltd., the southeastern portion of which covered 
the current Project area, indicated anomalous copper along Rude Creek (Trowsdale, 
1970).  

1970 A reconnaissance grid soil survey, to follow up anomalous Cu and Mo in silts in Victor 
Creek, was conducted for Great Horn Mining Syndicate Inc., by International Mine 
Services Ltd., the northern portion of which covered the very southern current Project
area. Samples were analyzed for Cu, Mo and Pb and identified a copper anomaly in 
the headwaters of Victor Creek, just south of the southeast Project area (Waugh, 
1970).  

1991 The very western part of Walhalla Explorations Ltd.'s Battle Creek property extended 
onto the eastern Project area but no work was conducted on the current Project 
(Doherty, 1992). 

1995 The Battle claims were restaked by Cominco Ltd., including more ground to the west 
than previous, which covered the current Trombley zone as well as the headwaters of 
Rude Creek. About 82 contour soil samples were collected from the Project area at a 
100m spacing and analyzed for Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag and Au, but no significant results were 
obtained. Prospecting/mapping indicated trace chalcopyrite, malachite and 
molybdenite in a pyritic zone on the hilltop above the Haxe Minfile location and 
Trombley zone ("Hilltop" plug, now mapped as Casino suite). Disseminated 
molybdenite, chalcopyrite, magnetite ±malachite also occurs with pyrite on the ridge 
between Rude and Battle Creeks, associated with aplitic dykes. Strong disseminated 
pyrite (10-15%) with rare chalcopyrite was found at the western end of the current 
Northeast gold soil anomaly, associated with what appears to be Casino and 
Prospector Mountain suite dykes. 

In the 1980's, the emphasis generally switched to precious metal exploration through 
the Dawson Range due to the discovery of the Mt. Skukum mine and activity at the Mt. 
Nansen mine. There was a resurgence in gold exploration in the late 1990's with 
emphasis on intrusion related gold targets following the discovery of Fort Knox and then 
Pogo (originally thought to be of this type) in Alaska. Gold exploration was renewed and 
rocketed in 2009 with the discovery of the Golden Saddle deposit at White Gold by 
Underworld Resources Ltd. (now owned by White Gold Corp.) and subsequent 
discovery of the Coffee deposit in 2011 by Kaminak Gold Corp. (now owned and being 
developed by Goldcorp Inc.; there is currently a proposed transaction between 
Newmont and Goldcorp to merge as Newmont Goldcorp (Goldcorp Inc., 2019)). The 
recent discovery in 2018 of high grade gold at the Vertigo showing of White Gold Corp. 
has intensified exploration in the region. The above deposits will be discussed in more 
detail under section 8.0, "Deposit Type". Gold exploration on the Project is summarized 
below. 



18

1985-6 Archer, Cathro & Associates (1981) Ltd. added the Hen & Oke claims to their Mt. 
Cockfield property, which extended it into the southeastern portion of the current 
Project. It was sold to Nordac Mining Corporation, which explored for gold-silver 
mineralization, but no work was conducted on the Project area (Carne, 1987). This 
work is related to the Mt. Cockfield Minfile copper-molybdenum porphyry showing just 
southeast of the Project. Further southeast, gold-silver bearing veins, associated with a 
northwest trending shear zone (Koe Shear), were being explored by Kerr Addison 
Mines from 1983 to 1986 (Arscott, 1986). The area is now covered by SFN R-12A 
(Figure 2), but the shear zone may extend about 8 km to the northwest along trend to 
the vicinity of the Northeast zone. 

1999-2000 Prime Properties Syndicate staked the EIO claims within the current Project to cover 
the headwaters of Trombley Creek from which a 300 ppb Au in silt anomaly was 
obtained in a stream sediment survey by the Geological Survey of Canada ("GSC") 
with anomalous As, W, Sb, moderate Mo and lesser Sn; Bi and Te were not analyzed
(GSC, 1986). It was optioned to Prospector International Resources Inc. ("Prospector 
International "), which conducted geochemical sampling (91 soil, 1 silt and 4 rock 
samples) and prospecting, outlining a discontinuous 150 by 550m east trending Au-As-
Bi-Ag anomaly (Trombley soil anomaly) with peak values of 1254 ppb Au, 3.07 g/t Ag, 
163.1 ppm As and 17.84 ppm Bi (Jaworski and Meyer, 2000 & Jaworski and 
Vanwemeskerken, 2001). 

A fluid inclusion analysis by Cadence Mineral Resources Inc. on potassically altered, 
tourmaline bearing granodiorite from the Trombley area indicated high temperature 
alteration from a relatively shallow deposit (< 1 kbar depth) and/or the top of a system 
and was consistent with vein and intrusion related gold systems (Jaworski and Meyer, 
2000). The claims expired in 2004 to 2005. 

2007-8 The Royal 1-12 claims were staked by Shawn Ryan in 2007 to cover the Trombley soil 
anomaly and proximal magnetic high anomaly. About 74 ridge and spur soil samples 
were collected in 2008 from the current Project area at a 100m spacing, returning low 
level anomalies with peak values of 32 ppb Au, 62.5 ppm As and 2.3 ppm Bi (Ryan, 
2008). It should be noted that ridge and spur sampling over the Latte zone at the 
Coffee deposit would only have returned a point >50 ppb Au soil anomaly.  

2010 A program of reconnaissance geochemical sampling (224 soil, 13 rock and 2 bulk 
stream samples) and mapping was conducted on the Poker claims by Boomerang 
Exploration Ltd. ("Boomerang"). It was successful in relocating the Rude Creek 
polymetallic vein showing and returning anomalous soil results with a notable Cu, Mo, 
Bi, Sb, Sn, W, Ag ±Au anomaly at the boundary of Poker 79 and 81, about 500m south 
of the current Northeast soil anomaly. A bulk stream sample from near the mouth of 
Trombley Creek yielded 3.16 g/t Au (Andersen, 2011). The 2010 program was funded 
by Silver Quest Resources Ltd. (now Independence Gold Corp.) which optioned the 
claims later in the year. 

2010-11 The Ann claims were staked by 0890763 BC Ltd. in 2010, surrounding the Poker 
claims, and were also optioned to Silver Quest Resources Ltd. A program consisting of 
a 1351 line km helicopter-borne magnetic and radiometric geophysical survey over a 
larger area including the entire Project and a reconnaissance soil survey, with about 
133 samples at a 100m spacing on the current Project, was conducted by Silver Quest 
Resources Ltd. in 2011 under option. The geophysics survey confirmed a magnetic 
high anomaly centred around the headwaters of Rude Creek (Congdon, 2011) and the 
soil survey identified a roughly 2 by 3 km Au-Bi-As-W-Sn anomaly in the northeast 
property area (Northeast soil anomaly) with a peak value of 87 ppb Au (98

th
 percentile 

was 18.6 ppb Au) (Cote, 2015a).  



19

2011 Ethos Gold Corp. (formerly Ethos Capital Corp.) undertook a reconnaissance 
geological evaluation and a small 65 soil sampling program on the Royal claims under 
option from Ryan. More detailed sampling was recommended based on anomalous 
gold in soil results spatially associated with the mapped quartz feldspar porphyry plug 
on the hilltop (Hilltop plug) above the Trombley soil anomaly (Tallman, 2012). 

The Royal and Poker claims were optioned by 0890763 BC Ltd. in 2014 and together 
with its Ann claims form the current Rude Creek Gold Project. Work conducted on the 
Project by 0890763 BC Ltd. consisted of the collection of 496 grid and lesser contour 
soil samples, 2.49 km of IP geophysics, a property wide high resolution fixed wing aerial 
photographic survey, 219.5m of RAB drilling in 3 holes and 504.5m of RC drilling in 5 
holes as follows.  

Work by 0890763 BC Ltd.: 

2014 A program consisting of a 172 sample soil geochemical survey, to validate and infill 
previous geochemical surveys, and 2.49 km of IP geophysics was conducted all on the 
Trombley soil anomaly area (Cote, 2015a). The surveys identified strong anomalies 
with a northwest trend. 

2015 A program consisting of 129.8m of RAB drilling in 2 holes and a 166 sample soil 
geochemical survey to extend the Trombley anomaly to the west and to infill previous 
reconnaissance soil lines in the northeast was conducted. Additional anomalous soils 
were identified at the Northeast soil anomaly, but the drill program did not return 
significant results (Cote, 2015c). 

2016 A program consisting of a high resolution fixed wing aerial photographic survey over 
the entire property, one RAB drill hole on the Trombley soil anomaly and a 158 sample 
soil grid over the Northeast soil anomaly resulted in the delineation of a 600m long and 
300 to 400m wide strong gold in soil anomaly within a broader anomaly about 2 km 
northeast of the Trombley soil anomaly (Fage, 2016). The RAB hole encountered weak 
gold mineralization of 0.2 g/t over 7.6m (Fage, 2016). 

2017-18 Follow up with 504.5m of RC drilling in 5 holes on the Trombley soil anomaly returned 
0.53 g/t Au over 13.4m including 0.63g/t Au over 6.1m and 2.14 g/t Au over 1.53m in 
hole ROYRC17-05 and 0.52 g/t Au over 4.57m including 1.17 g/t Au over 1.52m in 
ROYRC18-07 (Fage, 2017 and 2018).  

The details and results of the more recent exploration programs will be discussed under 
their respective sections below. The drill programs will be discussed in detail under 
Section 10.0, "Drilling". The exploration work from 2014 to 2016 and on the Royal 
claims in 2008 and 2011 was completed by GroundTruth Exploration Inc. or their 
predecessor, a private mineral exploration consulting firm based in Dawson City, Yukon 
Territory.  

6.1    Geochemistry (Figures 3 to 7) 

At least 1,393 soil samples have been collected from the Rude Creek Gold Project, 
covering only about 15% of the property, of which only 1165 soils have been analyzed 
for gold. Recent soil surveys that were analyzed for gold include 357 samples for Silver 
Quest by Boomerang in 2010 and by Silver Quest in 2011, and 496 by 0892762 BC Ltd. 



20

between 2014 and 2016 (Figure 3). In addition, the 139 soils collected by Shawn Ryan 
in 2008 and Ethos in 2011, and the 91 soils collected by Prospector International in 
1999 and 2000 were also analyzed for gold. 

Ridge and spur soil samples were collected at a 100m sample spacing, with a 50m 
spacing on contour lines in the Northeast Anomaly area. Grid soils were collected from 
two separate grids (Trombley and Northeast) at a 25m sample spacing along north-
south lines spaced 100m apart at the Trombley zone and at a 50m sample spacing 
along east-west lines spaced 200m apart at the Northeast zone.  

All GroundTruth soil samples were collected from the C-B horizons with one meter soil 
augers, or with a mattock where necessary, depending on vegetative cover and the 
thickness of the organic horizon. Approximately 400-500 grams of soil were collected 
and placed in well marked pre-numbered Kraft soil bags. Sample stations were marked 
on the ground with an aluminum metal tag in 2011 and a plastic bar coded tag in 2014 
to 2016, along with pink flagging. Sample locations were recorded by GPS in the field 
using UTM coordinates, Nad 83 datum, Zone 7 projection and pictures taken of each 
sample and sample site. Field soil duplicates (collected from the same site, but separate 
holes) were collected every 25 samples for quality control from 2011 to 2016.

In Boomerang's 2010 program soil about 280g of material was collected with one meter 
soil augers, primarily from the B horizon at an average depth of 30 cm and locations 
were recorded by GPS in the field. In the 2011 Silver Quest program, soils were 
primarily collected from the B horizon at a depth of 10 to 40 cm. In the 1999 to 2000 
Prospector International programs, the 91 soils collected were primarily from the C 
horizon from pits at a depth of 30 to 60 cm, with the 75 Trombley grid samples collected 
along northeast trending lines at a 50m sample spacing on lines 100m apart. 

Two significant gold soil anomalies have been delineated on the Project. There is a 
good correlation of anomalous gold with anomalous bismuth ± tellurium, and peripheral 
arsenic, silver, ± antimony and lead. Gold in soil anomalies are shown in Figure 3, gold 
results from the detailed grids in Figures 4 and 5 and gold anomalies draped over the 
aerial photographic image in Figures 6 and 7. 

The Trombley anomaly (Figure 4), first identified in 1999 and 2000, covers a 
discontinuous (due to talus cover) easterly trending, 150m by 550m soil anomaly, 
defined by the 90

th
 percentile value of 38 ppb Au (historical outline in Figure 4), with 

peak values of 1254 ppb and 331 ppb Au, 39.35 ppm Bi, 157 ppm As and 3.07 ppm Ag. 
Subsequent sampling outlined a 150m by 350m more west-northwest trend with peak 
values of 339.9 ppb Au, 19.5 ppm Bi, 275.9 ppm As and 2 ppm Ag, and two northerly 
gold bearing structural zones are indicated by drilling. Consequently, the grid is not 
favourably oriented to detect the structures and anomalies remain open to the north and 
south and somewhat to the east.  

Multiple northerly anomalous trends are evident in the Northeast zone, with at least five 
distinct, linear, 800m long (limited by grid extent) gold anomalies over the 1.5 km wide 
grid, remaining open in all directions (Figure 5). Peak values of 366.9 ppb Au, 43.9 ppm 
Bi, 597 ppm As, 3.1 ppm Ag, 30.2 Sb and 167 ppm Pb were obtained.

6.2 Aerial Photographic Survey (Figures 6 and 7) 

A high resolution fixed wing aerial photographic survey using an XCAM sensor was 
completed over the Rude Creek Gold Project on June 25, 2016 for 0890763 BC Ltd. by 
GroundTruth Exploration Inc. of Dawson City, Yukon. The survey was flown to aid in 
geological, structural and surficial interpretations, mapping, survey planning, 
geomorphology and infrastructure analysis, and to provide a baseline for environmental 
impact assessment, up to date high resolution imagery and digital elevation models for 
control. The contoured soil geochemistry is draped over the image in Figures 6 and 7.  

6.3 Geophysics (Figures 8 to 13 and 16) 

A reconnaissance high resolution airborne magnetic, radiometric and VLF-EM 
geophysical survey was flown by Sander Geophysics Limited for the Geological Survey 
of Canada in 1993 over the Selwyn River area, including the Rude Creek Project, to aid 
in geological interpretation through this largely unglaciated region (Shives and Carson, 
1994). An oval shaped, northwest trending, magnetic high anomaly, within a large area of 
elevated magnetic signature, and a strong potassium anomaly were found to occur in the 
headwaters of Rude and Trombley Creeks, drained by the 300 ppb Au in stream sediment 
sample obtained by the GSC (GSC, 1986).  

A compilation of the geophysics of the Yukon Plateau was subsequently undertaken by 
Hayward et al. (2012) and is used to illustrate some of the major structures in the 
region. The Koe shear zone and Jens Creek fault are extrapolated from mapping and 
geophysical interpretation, respectively, from Arscott (1986), Carnes (1987) and Taylor 
(1966). The regional and property scale structures will be discussed in more detail 
under their respective sections within section 7.0, "Geological Setting and 
Mineralization".  

A 1,351 line km high resolution airborne magnetic and radiometric geophysical survey 
was completed over a larger area, but including the entire Rude Creek Project, in 2011 by 
Aeroquest Airborne of Mississauga, Ontario for Silver Quest Resources Ltd. to help 
identify regional scale structures, lithological contacts and zones of alteration. The survey 
block was flown in a 040°/220° direction with a line spacing of 100m and a nominal 
helicopter stinger terrain clearance of 30m utilizing a helicopter stinger mounted caesium 
vapour magnetometer sensor and Aeroquest's Airborne Gamma Ray Spectrometer 
(AGRS) system which was installed in the helicopter's cabin (Areoquest Airborne, 2011).  

The 2011 survey was successful in producing higher resolution of the magnetic and 
radiometric data. The anomalous gold in soil geochemistry at the Trombley and 
Northeast soil anomalies is associated with lower magnetic signatures at the margin of 
the magnetic high anomalies (Figure 9), structural intersections (Figure 10) and Th/K 
lows (Figure 11). The magnetic lows are likely due to magnetite destruction caused 
by alteration and the Th/K lows related to potassic alteration (probably sericite and 
possibly potassium feldspar).

A detailed 2.49 line km high resolution direct current ground resistivity/induced 
polarization survey was completed on the Trombley zone in 2014, which is summarized 
from Cote (2015a). The survey was conducted along six 415m long north trending lines 
at a 100m line spacing (Figure 16) using a 5m electrode spacing, which provides an 
optimal horizontal resolution of 2.5m and a maximum reading depth of 90m. Dipole-
dipole (optimal for vertical structures) and inverse Schlumberger (optimal for horizontal 
structures) arrays were used, merged and inverted. The purpose of the survey was to 
define the underlying structural controls and horizontal extent of mineralization and 
detect any significant conductors and resistive or chargeability features that may be 
related to mineralization or lithology.  

The terrain in the eastern quadrant of the survey is overlain by coarse talus, in which it 
is difficult to obtain good electrical contact. Resistivity data obtained for all lines is of 
good quality and the IP data is of moderate to good quality; the latter is more sensitive, 
with noise most apparent in lines 05 and 06 in the east, although there is a reasonable 
correlation with trends found on the western portion of the survey. 

The survey outlined a resistivity high feature, suggestive of the presence of a younger 
silicified or potassic altered plug possibly of the Casino plutonic suite, a small body of 
which has been mapped, but not dated, on the hilltop above the Trombley zone (Ryan et 
al., 2013a). 

The resistivity inversions show a large circular, near vertical resistivity high anomaly with 
the highest values centered over lines ROYIP14-02 and -03 (Figure 12). Line ROYIP14-
02 shows a prominent vertical resistivity low structure (between 200 and 240m) 
corresponding with a bordering chargeability high, indicating a favourable conductive, 
chargeable zone. The IP inversions also show a general northwest trending zone of 
chargeability characterized by a broad zone of high chargeability in the west, branching 
into two smaller lineaments to the east (Figure 12). 

Three dimensional resistivity and IP chargeability models are shown in Figure 13, 
illustrating a major break in the resistivity, which corresponds to a vertical chargeability 
low feature, an airborne magnetic lineament (Figure 10) and break in the anomalous 
gold geochemistry (Figure 16). The main gold in soil anomaly is associated with a 
resistivity low and generally a chargeability high anomaly (Figure 12). The feature is 
suggestive of a significant, possible controlling, structure.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology (Figure 14) 

The Rude Creek Gold Project lies within Yukon-Tanana terrane, a continental arc that 
developed along the ancient Pacific margin of North America from Late Devonian to 
Permian time, and is situated between the Tintina Fault, about 150 km to the northeast, 
and the Denali Fault, 100 km to the southwest. Both faults are steeply dipping 
transcurrent structures with hundreds of kilometres of dextral strike slip offset.  

The Stevenson Ridge (formerly Snag) map sheet (NTS 115J) was mapped at 1:253,440 
scale by the Geological Survey of Canada in the early 1970's (Tempelman-Kluit, 1974) 
and the Colorado Creek map sheet (115 J/10) at 1:50,000 in 1986 by Payne et al. 
(1987). Gordey and Makepeace produced a Yukon-wide geological compilation in 1999, 
with a revision in 2003. In 2011 to 2012 the MDRU investigated projects within the 
Dawson Range and released their findings in 2013 (Allan et al., 2013 and 2012). The 
Geological Survey of Canada completed 1:100,000 scale mapping through the area in 
2012 (Ryan et al., 2013a & b). The Yukon Geological Survey ("YGS") released an 
update of the Yukon compilation map with revised nomenclature (Colpron et al., 2016), 
recently updated in April, 2018 (YGS, 2018). The regional geology of the area is 
primarily summarized from Ryan et al. (2013), Allan et al. (2013) and YGS (2018). 

Yukon-Tanana terrane is dominated in the regional area by Devonian and older 
metasiliciclastic rocks of the Snowcap assemblage (PDS), which interfinger with, and 
are stratigraphically overlain by, Devonian to Mississippian intermediate to mafic 
metavolcanic rocks of the Finlayson assemblage and lesser felsic metavolcanic rocks 
(DMF). The metasiliciclastic rocks include metamorphosed fine clastic rocks, quartzite 
and conglomerate. The above lithologies include marble horizons and are 
metamorphosed to amphibolite grade.  

Abundant orthogneiss bodies of the Mississippian Simpson Range plutonic suite 
(MgSR) and Permian Sulphur Creek orthogneiss (PqS) occur throughout the region. 
The Mississippian orthogneiss compositions range from granite to potassium feldspar 
augen bearing to tonalite and diorite. The Sulphur Creek orthogneiss includes granitic 
and potassium feldspar augen orthogneiss and highly strained, mafic poor orthogneiss. 
Narrow bodies of Paleozoic ultramafic rocks, commonly serpentinized, also occur within 
the area. 

The above units are interpreted to represent two arcs: an older Devonian to 
Mississippian arc consisting of amphibolite (DMF) and associated subvolcanic 
intrusions (MgSR) built on a siliciclastic basement (PDS); and a Permian arc of granitic 
orthogneiss (PgS) and coeval metavolcanic rocks (PKs) built on the Devono-
Mississippian arc. 

The above lithologies are intruded by intermediate granitoid batholiths, plutons and 
stocks of the Early Jurassic to Late Triassic Minto suite (LTREJM) and Early Jurassic 
Long Lake suite (EJL), and generally equigranular granitic rocks of the Mid Cretaceous 
Whitehorse suite (mKW), which include the Coffee Creek (mKW1) and the Dawson 
Range phases (mKW2). These intrusive bodies and metamorphic basement rocks are 



34

unconformably overlain by intermediate to felsic flows, breccia and tuff of the Mid 
Cretaceous Mount Nansen Group (mKN).  

The early Late Cretaceous Casino plutonic suite (LKC) was then emplaced at 79 to 74 
Ma and typically consist of generally small intermediate stocks and related felsic quartz 
porphyry, quartz-feldspar porphyry or feldspar porphyry dykes, sills and small plugs. 
The Casino suite is intimately associated with porphyry copper deposits and many 
precious metal vein deposits in the Dawson Range. Most intrusions of this suite were 
previously assigned to the Prospector Mountain suite (LKP) or the Mount Nansen 
Group (mKN) and have not all been reclassified.  

All the above lithologies are locally intruded by late Late Cretaceous (72 to 68 Ma), 
primarily felsic to intermediate stocks and related felsic feldspar ±quartz porphyry dykes, 
sills and small plugs of the Prospector Mountain suite (LKP) and overlain by related 
massive, primarily mafic (with lesser intermediate to felsic), flows and breccias of the 
Carmacks Group (uKv), which includes localized coarse clastic sedimentary rocks at 
the base of the sequence (lKs).  

The Cretaceous aged, northwest trending, dextral strike slip Big Creek fault 
approximately borders the northeastern margin of the southern Dawson Range gold and 
copper belt, while the Coffee Creek fault lies proximal to this boundary further to the 
northwest (Figure 14). The Coffee Creek fault appears to be a sinistral strike slip 
Jurassic aged fault that was reactivated in the Cretaceous with dextral strike slip 
movement. It appears to be offset by the Big Creek fault system. The Dip Creek fault is 
a northeast trending fault just west of the Project with about 370m of sinistral strike slip 
offset in this area. 

The Rude Creek Gold Project is situated within the northwest trending Dawson Range 
gold and copper belt, historically considered to extend 250 km from the Mount Nansen 
area into Alaska, but recently extended another 100 km to the south into the Aishihik 
Lake area, where age dating has identified similar age intrusions and mineralization. 
The belt hosts several deposits and mineralized showings of various deposit models 
including calc-alkalic porphyry copper-goldmolybdenum, associated adjacent 
epithermal vein and breccia systems, and peripheral polymetallic veins, as well as 
orogenic gold and intrusion related gold. Many occur proximal to the Big Creek and 
Coffee Creek faults and splays. 

Significant deposits include Casino Mining Corporation's Casino porphyry copper-gold-
molybdenum deposit, the Klaza deposit of Rockhaven Resources (a transitional variant 
of an epithermal system), and Goldcorp's Coffee orogenic gold deposit. Mineralization is 
commonly associated with Late Cretaceous intrusions (primarily small plugs and breccia 
bodies of the Late Cretaceous Casino suite and, to a lesser extent, the Prospector 
Mountain suite), and is usually hosted by the Late Cretaceous intrusions, the older 
metamorphosed basement complex of the Yukon-Tanana terrane, and/or the Mid 
Cretaceous Dawson Range batholith (Whitehorse suite). The Rude Creek Gold Project 
lies 14.5 km to the southeast of the Casino deposit, 45 km to the southeast of the 
Coffee deposit and 75 km to the northwest of the Nucleus and Revenue deposits of 
Triumph Resources' Freegold Mountain project (Figure 14).

7.2      Property Geology (Figure 15) 

Property scale mapping has not been undertaken across the Rude Creek Gold Project, 
but some mapping was conducted in 1990 and 1996 by Cominco in the eastern half of 
the Project (Denton, 1980 and Wagner, 1996), and local prospecting with geological 
observations was conducted in the Haxe Minfile area by Prospector International
(Jaworski and Meyer, 2000 & Jaworski and Vanwemeskerken, 2001) and on the Poker 
claims by Boomerang (Andersen, 2011). The Yukon Geological Survey digital geology 
has been used as a base in Figure 15 (website at http://mapservices. 
gov.yk.ca/YGS/Load.htm). Outcrop is limited on the property, comprising 1 to 2 percent, 
and generally confined to ridge tops and creek exposures. Talus and felsenmeer is fairly 
common in the eastern property area, but can mask the underlying rock. 

The Project is shown by the YGS to be almost entirely underlain by generally 
equigranular granitic rocks of the Dawson Range phase of the Mid Cretaceous 
Whitehorse plutonic suite (mKW2), which is intruded by a small plug and related dykes 
and/or sills of the early Late Cretaceous Casino plutonic suite on the hilltop in the 
headwaters of Rude and Trombley Creeks (Hilltop plug), and by part of the late Late 
Cretaceous Mt. Cockfield stock of the Prospector Mountain suite (LKP) in the 
southeastern property area, and probable related dykes and sills (Figure 15). Variably 
micaceous quartzite and siliciclastic schistose metasedimentary rocks of the Devonian 
to Neoproterozoic Snowcap assemblage (PDS1) are exposed just east of the Project, 
and possibly along the eastern margin. 

The Hilltop plug consists of medium grained, hypabyssal, porphyritic hornblende 
rhyodacite with abundant, large, smoky quartz phenocrysts (Ryan et al., 2013a) and has 
not been dated. It is unknown at this point if it belongs to the Casino or Prospector 
Mountain suite due to strong similarities between the two. 

A table of Formations follows: 

Upper Cretaceous 
LKyP: Prospector Mountain suite: Mt. Cockfield stock: intermediate syenite to monzonite 
(72 to 68 Ma) 
LKyP: Casino suite: fine to medium grained quartz-feldspar porphyry monzonite, dacite 
(79 to 74 Ma) 

Middle Cretaceous 
mKgW2: Whitehorse suite: Dawson Range phase: white to beige, medium to coarse 
grained, unfoliated to weakly foliated, generally equigranular biotite-hornblende 
granodiorite, lesser granite, tonalite, quartz diorite and diorite

Devonian to Neoproterozoic 
PDS1: Snowcap assemblage: quartzite, micaceous quartzite, quartz-muscovite-biotite 
schist (±garnet and aluminosilicates), and minor metaconglomerate 

The Dip Creek fault, just west of the Project, is a northeast trending fault with about 
370m of sinistral strike slip offset in this area. A northerly trending normal fault, east side 
down, borders the eastern property boundary. A number of northwest trending faults 
appear to dissect the Project, which are primarily seen in the property airborne CVG 
magnetic map (Figure 10). The Jens Creek fault was initially interpreted from airborne 
geophysics (Taylor, 1966) and is evident in the airborne CVG magnetic map. A vertical, 



38

northwest trending fault (Trombley fault) is interpreted from the Resistivity/IP survey on 
the Trombley zone (Figures 10, 12 and 13). This fault shows a similar strike to a 25m 
wide shear zone, trending 130/34°NE, mapped in the Rude Creek canyon near the 
junction with Ray Creek (Andersen, 2011). East-northeast trending cross-structures 
were noted in the area with slickensides at 077°/69°S, noted 400m downstream and the 
Rude Creek fissure vein-fault was found to have an orientation of 060°/26°S (Andersen, 
2011). 

The Northwest trending Koe shear zone could trend through upper Battle and Rude 
Creeks, proximal to the western Northeast soil anomaly, which appears to be supported 
by the airborne CVG magnetic map (Figure 10). The Koe shear zone hosts gold-silver-
antimony-arsenic bearing chalcedonic, drusy and massive quartz veins and clay-
sericite-pyrite alteration approximately 8 km southeast of the Northeast zone.  

A northeast trending fault, also evident in the airborne CVG magnetic map (Figure 10), 
appears to divert the central, northerly trending gold soil anomalies at the Northeast 
zone. A northeast trending dyke of the Casino suite appears to follow this structure 
further to the northeast (Figure 15).  

7.3 Mineralization (Figures 3 and 15) 

The Rude Creek Gold Project covers the Haxe anomaly and Rude Creek showing, both 
documented as silver-lead-zinc±gold polymetallic vein occurrences (Minfile Numbers 
115J 020 and 021) by the Yukon Geological Survey (Deklerk, 2009 and 
http://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/) (Figure 15). The Rude Creek showing consists of a 
4.26m long and up to 1m wide, easterly (or possibly more north-northeasterly) trending 
carbonate (possible siderite) fissure vein, mineralized with galena, sphalerite and pyrite 
returning 0.34 g/t Au, 4198 g/t Ag and 37% Pb over 11 cm (Cockfield, 1927) and was 
explored by a 21.9m adit and trenching between 1922 and 1953. Other polymetallic vein 
occurrences are known in the general area, including the Victor (Minfile Number 115J 
021), just to the south of the Project, and the Idaho (115J 099) and Nordex (115J 023), 
both about 2 km to the north (Figure 15). No information is known about the Toad (115J 
024) occurrence.

The Rude Creek showing was re-located in 2010, approximately 250m upstream of its 
plotted location, at 621818mE, 6951357mN, Nad 83, Zone 7. An 8 cm wide 
representative sample of the 060°/26°S trending sulphide bearing fissure vein returned 
0.38 g/t Au, 1780 g/t Ag, >20% Pb, 0.15% Zn, 0.123% Cu, 140 ppm Mo, with >10,000 
ppm As, 1875 ppm Sb, 19.5 ppm Bi, and 10 ppm Hg and the wallrock yielded 3.77% Pb 
with 9.7 g/t Ag (Andersen, 2011). Tourmaline breccia float was observed just 
downstream, but did not contain significant results. Tourmaline and tourmaline breccias 
are commonly associated with porphyry copper deposits and can be associated with 
gold mineralization. This mineralization lies proximal to a northwest trending shear 
zone, with a similar trend to the Trombley fault. 

Two significant gold soil anomalies have been delineated on the Project (Figure 3) with 
a good correlation of anomalous gold with anomalous bismuth, ±tellurium, and 

http://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/


39

peripheral arsenic, silver, ±antimony and lead. The Trombley anomaly covers an 
easterly trending 150m by 350m, discontinuous to 550m (due to talus cover), >38 ppb 
Au soil anomaly (Figure 4) underlain by locally tourmaline bearing and chloritized, 
biotite-hornblende granodiorite. Multiple northerly gold anomalous trends are evident in 
the Northeast zone, with at least five distinct linear, 800m long gold anomalies over the 
1.5 km wide grid, and remain open in all directions (Figure 5). The area also appears to 
be underlain by biotite-hornblende granodiorite, intruded by a variety of dykes of the 
Casino and Prospector Mountain suites. Extensive pyrite (up to 15%) and trace 
chalcopyrite were noted associated with dykes in an outcrop in the western portion of 
the zone (Wagner, 1996).  

Only the Trombley soil anomaly has been drilled, with a total of 723.9m of RAB and RC 
drilling in 8 holes. Two north trending structures were intercepted returning 0.53 g/t Au 
over 13.4m including 0.63g/t Au over 6.1m and 2.14 g/t Au over 1.53m in hole 
ROYRC17-05 and 0.52 g/t Au over 4.57m including 1.17 g/t Au over 1.52m in 
ROYRC18-07 (Figures 17 and 18 and Table 3). A low grade intercept near the bottom 
of ROYRC18-07 correlates vertically down dip from the mineralized intercept in 
ROYRC17-05. The best gold grades are coincident with sericite altered granodiorite, 
with about 5 to 10% limonite after pyrite, ±pyrite and arsenopyrite, with minor (to 5%) 
fine quartz ±carbonate veining. 

The north trends obtained for the gold bearing structures in drilling indicate that the 
Trombley grid is not favourably oriented to detect the structures and anomalies remain 
open to the north and south and somewhat to the east. In addition, three of the drill 
holes (RAB16-03, RC17-06 and RC18-08) were drilled parallel to the direction of the 
gold bearing structures. Two additional holes (RAB15-01 and -02) were drilled away 
from the gold soil anomaly. 

Pyrite, minor molybdenite and chalcopyrite ±malachite mineralization occurs within the 
southern end of the Hilltop plug above the Trombley zone and within the Mt. Cockfield 
stock in the southeastern Project area where sheeted magnetite veins have also been 
noted (Figure 15). This mineralization and alteration may be associated with the 
Cockfield porphyry showing, about 1.5 km southeast of the southeastern Project area.  

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPE  

The Rude Creek Gold Project lies within the Dawson Range gold district, about 45 km 
southeast of Goldcorp's Coffee deposit where mid Cretaceous aged gold mineralization 
(dated at 97 to 92 Ma) is hosted by metamorphosed Paleozoic basement rocks of the 
Yukon-Tanana terrane (primarily a felsic orthogneiss) and the mid Cretaceous (99.5 
±0.9 Ma) Coffee Creek pluton, part of the Dawson Range Batholith. There is a strong 
structural control to the mineralization with northerly and easterly structures 
predominating (Figure 19). Gold mineralization is typically associated with pyrite or 
limonite (after pyrite) and occurs in brittle structures, breccias, ± with quartz, fracture 
fillings, quartz vein stockworks, silicified flooded zones and quartz-sericite-pyrite altered 
granite. Dolomite and illite alteration, hematite, arsenopyrite and stibnite also occur and 



40

there is some association of gold with arsenian pyrite. The mineralization has been 
classified as orogenic (Makarenko et al., 2014). 

The Rude Creek Gold Project is also situated 80 km south-southeast of the recent 
Vertigo discovery and 72 km southeast of the Golden Saddle deposit, both orogenic 
type gold systems owned by White Gold Corp. They occur just to the north of the 
Dawson Range gold district within the White Gold district, where gold mineralization 
typically exhibits an older Jurassic age compared to the Cretaceous ages typical within 
the Dawson Range. The author has not been able to independently verify the above 
information and it is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Rude Creek 
Gold Project which is the subject of this report.

Gold mineralization within the White Gold district is characterized by the orogenic type. 
Mineralization is controlled by a brittle to brittle-ductile D4 deformation event dated as 
Middle to Late Jurassic (155-160 Ma), which corresponds to the age of regional 
exhumation and cooling in the region (Allan et al., 2013). Epizonal features (breccias, 
rapid crystallization textures) are prevalent (Allen et al., 2013) and gold is commonly 
associated with oxidized cubic pyrite. A common host rock is the felsic orthogneiss, due 
to its competency. The alteration assemblage includes sericite, silicification, carbonate, 
pervasive potassium feldspar and hematite (typical in the footwall zone). Most gold 
prospects in the White Gold district share a common relationship with small-
displacement, easterly trending, sinistral strike-slip faults (Allen et al., 2013).  

Drilling on the Trombley zone at the Rude Creek Gold Project indicated that the best 
gold grades are coincident with sericite altered granodiorite, with about 5 to 10% 
limonite after pyrite, ±pyrite and arsenopyrite, with minor (to 5%) fine quartz ±carbonate 
veining. Structural control is strongly indicated by mapped and interpreted structures 
from airborne magnetic and ground resistivity/IP geophysics, dykes and long, linear gold 
soil anomalies. Mineralization on the property appears to be of the orogenic deposit 
type. 

9.0 EXPLORATION 

No exploration has been conducted by Michelin on the Rude Creek Gold Project. At 
least $316,000 (filed for assessment) was spent in exploration within the last three 
years on the Project by 0890763 BC Ltd. from 2016 to 2018. Exploration by 0890763 
BC Ltd., completed from 2014 to 2018, consisted of the collection of 496 grid and lesser 
contour soil samples, 2.49 km of IP geophysics, a property wide high resolution fixed 
wing aerial photographic survey, 219.5m of RAB drilling in 3 holes and 504.5m of RC 
drilling in 5 holes. This work has been discussed under the respective sections under 
section 6.0, "History".

10.0 DRILLING (Figures 16-18) 

A total of 723.9m of drilling in 8 holes was completed on the Rude Creek Gold Project 
between 2015 and 2018 by 0890763 BC Ltd., including 219.5m of RAB drilling in 3 
holes and 504.4m of RC drilling in 5 holes. All drilling targeted the Trombley soil 
anomaly and was directed by Bart Jaworski of 0890763 BC Ltd. The RAB drilling was 
executed by GroundTruth of Dawson City, Yukon and the RC drilling by Midnight Sun 
Drilling Inc. ("Midnight Sun"). The following discussion of the drill programs are primarily 
summarized from Cote (2015c), and Fage (2017 and 2018a & b). 

The RAB drilling was performed by GroundTruth in 2015 and 2016, using their remote 
controlled, tracked, air/hydraulically operated RAB drill with a 60 hp turbo charged 
Kubota diesel engine. The drill uses a stationary 300/200 air compressor and a 90 mm 
COP32 hammer. Drill rods are 1.5m long, drill hole diameter is 8.88 cm and rock chips 
range in size from 1/4 to 3/8". The RC drilling was conducted by Midnight Sun of 
Whitehorse, Yukon in 2017 and 2018 using their Grasshopper helicopter portable RC 
rig using 2

7
/8" dual wall RC rods (90 mm hole size) and a center sample hammer. Both 

the RAB and RC drills were mobilized and demobilized to/from the site by helicopter 
from a staging area at the Rude Creek airstrip. 

RAB chip trays are stored at the premises of GroundTruth Exploration Inc., Dawson 
City, Yukon Territory and RC chip trays are now stored at the Yukon Geological Survey 
core library, Alaska Highway, Whitehorse. Most of the drill sites were inspected by the 
author during the site examination on January 17, 2019 and the RC chips were 
reviewed on February 14, 2019 at the core library.  

Drill hole specifications are summarized in Table 3 below with drill hole locations shown 
in Figure 16 and cross sections in Figures 17 and 18. In the drill tables "Elev." denotes 
elevation and "Az." azimuth.

All holes encountered granodiorite throughout their entire lengths, except for a possible 
fine grained dyke at 62.5 to 64m in ROYRC17-08, which was associated with elevated 
gold and arsenic. Drill results are summarized in Table 4 below and are graphically

* Insufficient information is available to estimate the true thickness of these intercepts and, as such, the

true thickness may be less than the down-hole length intercept reported above. 

ROYRAB15-01 and -02 targeted the strongest soil geochemical anomaly in the 
Trombley zone, deliberately irrespective of IP geophysical data; however part of the soil 
anomaly relies on historical data from 1999 to 2000, the exact location of which is 
suspect. ROYRAB15-02, also did not reach target depth due to slow drilling attributed to 
hard ground. ROYRAB16-03 targeted coincident recent soil geochemical and IP 
geophysical anomalies and yielded the best gold intercept from the RAB drill program, 
which is 0.21 g/t Au over 7.6m, including 0.75 g/t over 1.5m. The IP anomaly consists of 
a chargeability high/low contact with a coincident resistivity high, interpreted to 
represent a fault.  

The best gold intercept from the RC drilling is 0.53 g/t Au over 13.4m in hole ROYRC17-
05, accompanied by anomalous copper, lead, zinc, arsenic, and silver and including 
2.14 g/t Au over 1.5m. Hole ROYRC18-07 was drilled as a 30m step out behind 
ROYRC17-05 to test its down dip extent, and returned similar values of 0.52 g/t Au over 
4.57m including 1.17 g/t Au over 1.52m near surface (<19.8m) within a 21.3m interval of 
elevated arsenic (>50 ppm) from surface. A low grade intercept near the bottom of 
ROYRC18-07 correlates vertically down dip from the 0.53 g/t over 13.41m intercept 
from ROYRC17-05. The near-surface intercept in ROYRC18-07 is interpreted as a 
second, near vertical gold bearing structure (Figure 17). The best gold grades are 
coincident with sericite altered granodiorite, with about 5 to 10% limonite after pyrite, 
±pyrite and arsenopyrite, with minor fine quartz ±carbonate veining. 

The north trends obtained for the gold bearing structures indicate that the Trombley 
drilling was not favourably oriented to detect the structures and soil anomalies remain 
open to the north and south and somewhat to the east. Three of the drill holes (RAB16-
03, RC17-06 and RC18-08) were drilled parallel to the gold bearing structures and two 
additional holes (RAB15-01 and -02) were drilled away from the soil anomaly. 

Drill sampling methods are discussed under Section 11.0, "Sample Preparation, 
Analyses and Security", below.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

All RAB samples from the 2015 and 2016 programs and almost all samples from the 
2017 and 2018 RC programs were collected at 1.5m intervals, and representative chips 
catalogued in chip trays, which were photographed, logged and stored for future 
reference. Cuttings are deposited from the cyclone into a 20 litre bucket, which is 
dumped into an 8:1 splitter, with approximately 2.25 kg bagged as a sample and the 
remainder deposited into a retention bucket from which another 2.25 kg is bagged and 
labelled as a duplicate for retention. A small plastic container of chips is collected, dry 
and then wet sieved, and washed chips catalogued in chip trays with hole and sample 
number and interval marked. The remainder in the retention bucket is discarded and 
buckets and splitter are cleaned with pressurized air. The analytical sample is bagged in 
a 12"x20" ore bag, sample number barcode inserted into bag and sealed with zip tie 
with external barcode sample number attached. The analytical sample is placed into a 
rice bag marked with client, project code, bag series and number of samples, with 
generally 10 samples per bag. The rice bag is sealed with a zip tie and security zip tie.  

The RAB samples were logged by Al Doherty, P.Geo. of Aurum Geological Consultants 
Inc., Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, in Whitehorse in 2015 and by Adam Fage in 2016. 
RC logging was completed by geologists Kel Sax in 2017 and Linda Lewis in 2018. All 
sample intervals, primarily 1.5m long, in each drill hole were sampled resulting in a total 
of 466 samples.  

The only record of quality assurance and quality control ("QAQC") is in the 2018 
program with a total of 12 samples, consisting of 4 blanks and 4 standards inserted by 
the geologist and 4 duplicates, which were requested of specific sample rejects at the 
laboratory. The blank used was CDN-BL-10 (<0.01 g/t Au), consisting of granitic 
material and the standard was CDN-GS-P7L (0.709 ± 0.072 g/t) 
(http://www.cdnlabs.com/Certificates.htm). The standards and blanks returned results 
within acceptable limits. This indicates that the analytical results had an acceptable 
degree of precision and were free from contamination during sample preparation. 

All RAB drill samples were delivered by GroundTruth to the sample preparation facility 
of Bureau Veritas Mineral Laboratories ("BVML") in Whitehorse, Yukon via Kluane 
Freight Lines Ltd. All RC drill samples were delivered by Midnight Sun to their shop in 
Whitehorse, where they were logged and then transported to BVML's facility in 
Whitehorse. 

Samples were prepared at BVML's Whitehorse facility, then internally sent to BVML's 
Vancouver, British Columbia facility for analysis. All drill and rock sample preparation 
from 1999 to present involved crushing 1 kg to 70% passing through 10 mesh, split 
250g and pulverize to 85% passing through 200 mesh (PRP70-250). Gold in the RAB 
drill samples was analyzed by BVML's Group FA430 analysis, which involves a fire 
assay pre-concentration with an atomic absorption spectrometry ("AAS") finish on a 30g 
sample. Over limit gold values were assayed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. The 
samples were additionally analyzed for 36 elements, including gold, by BVML's Group 
AQ200 analysis, a multi-element inductively coupled plasma ("ICP") package which 
involves an aqua regia digestion with a mass spectrometry ("MS") finish on a 0.5g 



47

sample. All 2017 and 2018 drill samples were analyzed for 36 elements, including gold, 
by BVML's Group AQ202 analysis, a multi-element ICP package which involves a 
modified aqua regia digestion with a mass spectrometry finish on a 30g sample. 

All soil sample preparation from 1999 to 2016 involved drying at 60°C and sieving to -80 
mesh and all rock sample preparation was completed as discussed under drill samples 
(PRP70-250). 

The 2014 to 2016 soil samples were sent to BVML's sample preparation facility in 
Whitehorse where they were prepared, then internally sent to their Vancouver, British 
Columbia facility for analysis. The samples were analyzed for 36 elements, including 
gold, by BVML's Group AQ201 analysis, a multi-element ICP package which involves 
an aqua regia digestion with an MS finish on a 15g sample. Ryan's 2007 and Ethos' 
2011 soils were analyzed as above but in 2007 they were sent direct to Acme Analytical 
Laboratories Ltd. ("Acme", now BVML) in Vancouver, British Columbia and the 2011 
samples were delivered by GroundTruth to Acme's preparation facility in Dawson City 
where they were prepared, then internally sent to their Vancouver, British Columbia 
facility for analysis.  

The 2010 samples by Boomerang and 2011 samples by Silver Quest were submitted to 
ALS Minerals ("ALS") in Whitehorse for preparation and internally sent to their North 
Vancouver facility for analysis. All samples were analyzed for gold by fire assay using 
an atomic absorption finish on a 30g sample and for 51 elements by the ME-MS41 
technique using aqua-regia digestion with an ICP-MS finish on a 0.5g sample.  

Prospector International's 1999 and 2000 samples were shipped to Acme (now BVML) 
in Vancouver, British Columbia. Silt samples were sieved to two fractions, -150 +230 
mesh and -230 mesh. Gold was analyzed using an aqua regia digestion with an ICP-MS 
finish on a 30g sample. 

Quality control procedures were also implemented at the laboratory, involving the regular 
insertion of blanks and standards and check repeat analyses and resplits (re-analyses on 
the original sample prior to splitting). There is no evidence of any tampering with or 
contamination of the samples during collection, shipping, analytical preparation or 
analysis. All sample preparation was conducted by the laboratory. The laboratory is 
entirely independent from the issuer. All samples since 1999, except for the 2010 and 
2011 samples were analyzed by Bureau Veritas Mineral Laboratories or Acme 
Analytical Laboratories Ltd. (now BVML) of Vancouver, British Columbia. The 2010 
Boomerang and 2011 Silver Quest samples were analyzed by ALS in North Vancouver. 
BVML and ALS are, and Acme was, IS0 9001 accredited facilities and their preparation 
facilities were accredited for the procedures performed. In the author's opinion the 
sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures were entirely adequate. 

A sampling protocol should be implemented by Michelin, involving the routine and regular 
insertion of blanks, standards and duplicates sent to the primary laboratory, and re-
assaying of selected mineralized pulps at a second independent laboratory in future drill 
programs on the project.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

The current geochemical data was verified by sourcing original analytical certificates 
and digital data. Analytical data quality assurance and quality control was indicated by 
the favourable reproducibility obtained in laboratory and company inserted standards, 
blanks and duplicates (repeats). Quality control procedures are documented in Section 
11.0, "Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security". 

There does not appear to have been any tampering with or contamination of the 
samples during collection, shipping, analytical preparation or analysis. In the author's 
opinion, the data provided in this technical report is adequately reliable for its purposes. 

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The Rude Creek Gold Project is at an early exploration stage and no metallurgical 
testing has been carried out. 

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

There has not been sufficient work on the Rude Creek Gold Project to undertake a 
resource calculation.  

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES (Figures 2 and 15) 

An abutment of one claim width of the AXS claims of Casino Mining Corp. adjoins the 
Rude Creek Gold Project in one location along the northern property boundary (Figures 
2 and 15, and http://mapservices.gov.yk.ca/YGS/Load.htm). The claims appear to have 
been staked to protect access to the Casino deposit, located 15 km northwest of the 
Project.  

The AXS claims are adjoined to the north by the approximate 1200 ha Idaho property of 
ATAC Resources Ltd. where limited drilling, not deep enough to test the main 
IP anomalies, and airborne radiometric data indicate the potential for a high level 
porphyry system (website at http://www.atacresources.com/for-option/idaho-creek). 
Polymetallic veins also occur at the Idaho property, which are probably distally related 
to the porphyry system. Mineralization consists of limonite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena 
and sphalerite with peak gold and silver values of 15 g/t Au and 1,389 g/t Ag (Deklerk, 
2009).

The author has not been able to independently verify the above information and it is not 
necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Rude Creek Gold Project which is the 
subject of this report.

(Refer to Figures 2 and 15, and website at http://gysde.gov.yk.ca.)

24.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

To the author's knowledge, there is no additional information or explanation necessary 
to make this technical report understandable and not misleading. 

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Two significant gold soil anomalies have been delineated on the Project with associated 
anomalous bismuth, ±tellurium, and peripheral arsenic, silver, ±antimony and lead. The 
Trombley anomaly covers an apparently easterly trending 150m by 350m, 
discontinuous to 550m (due to talus cover), >38 ppb Au soil anomaly underlain by 
locally tourmaline bearing and chloritized biotite-hornblende granodiorite. Drilling of the 
soil anomaly, with a total of 723.9m of percussion drilling in 8 holes intersected two 
north trending structures returning 0.53 g/t Au over 13.4m including 0.63 g/t Au over 
6.1m and 2.14 g/t Au over 1.5m in hole ROYRC17-05 and 0.52 g/t Au over 4.57m 
including 1.17 g/t Au over 1.5m in ROYRC17-07.

The best gold grades are coincident with sericite altered granodiorite, with about 5 to 
10% limonite after pyrite, ±pyrite and arsenopyrite, with minor fine quartz ±carbonate 
veining. Both the soil grid and most of the drilling were not favourably oriented or 
positioned to intersect north trending structures. The anomaly and gold bearing 
structures remain open to the north, south and somewhat to the east, as well as down 
dip. 

Multiple northerly gold anomalous trends are evident in the Northeast zone, with at least 
five distinct, linear, 800m long gold anomalies over the 1.5 km wide grid, open in all 
directions. The Northeast zone also appears to be underlain by biotite-hornblende 
granodiorite, intruded by a variety of dykes of the Casino and Prospector Mountain 
suites. Extensive pyrite (up to 15%) and trace chalcopyrite were noted associated with 
dykes in an outcrop in the western portion of the zone.   

The deposit model for the Rude Creek Gold Project is the orogenic type, such as at 
Goldcorp's Coffee deposit, and at the Golden Saddle and VG deposits and the newly 
discovered Vertigo zone of White Gold Corp. The Coffee deposit is hosted by 
metamorphosed Paleozoic basement rocks of the Yukon-Tanana terrane and the Mid 
Cretaceous Coffee Creek pluton, of the Whitehorse plutonic suite in the Dawson Range 
batholith, with a strong structural control. Northerly and easterly trends dominate (Figure 
19). Strong similarities exist between the Rude Creek Gold Project and the Coffee 

http://gysde.gov.yk.ca/


50

deposit as follows: both are located within the Dawson Range gold district and are, at 
least in part, hosted by phases of the Whitehorse plutonic suite; steeply dipping, north 
trending structures dominate at the Supremo zone within the Coffee deposit and have 
been intersected in drilling at the Trombley zone and are suggested by trends within the 
Northeast gold soil anomaly on the Rude Creek Gold Project; a strong structural control 
is indicated at both; and there is a similarity in the size, shape and tenor of the gold in 
soil anomalies (Figure 19). The author has shown the data from the Coffee deposit for 
comparison only and it is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Rude 
Creek Gold Project which is the subject of this report, and does not suggest that similar 
results will be obtained on the Rude Creek Gold Project.

Similarities in the soil anomalies include the presence of multiple, long, linear >30 ppb 
Au soil anomalies. Many are >300m long and some reach 800m long in the Northeast 
zone at Rude Creek, limited by the extent of the grid. The Trombley grid is, and some of 
the drill holes were, oriented parallel to the gold bearing structures intersected in the 
drilling. The Kona zone at Coffee and the Rude Creek Gold Project are both underlain 
by phases of the Whitehorse plutonic suite, which provide good competent host rocks. 
This allows for the development of persistent, continuous structures. Dacite to 
rhyodacite dykes occur on both properties and an association of increased gold grade 
proximal to the dykes was noted in trenches and drill holes at the Coffee deposit. 
However, the mineralization at Coffee has been dated at 97-92 Ma, just slightly younger 
than the 99.5 Ma date on the Coffee Creek pluton part of the Dawson Range batholith. 
The dykes appear to be younger, probably following the same structures that are 
related to the mineralization. Therefore, mapping the dykes may be useful in delineating 
the controlling structures. 

The orientation of mineralization related to the gold soil anomaly at the Supremo zone 
of the Coffee deposit was difficult to determine and trenches were originally excavated 
parallel to the structural trends. A cross trench at T3, aerial lineaments, detailed soil 
sampling, and detailed prospecting were useful in providing a more accurate 
understanding of the underlying source and structural orientations. Consequently 
structural analysis, geophysical interpretation and detailed soil sampling are initially 
recommended prior to further drilling as discussed in the following section, 
"Recommendations". 

The Rude Creek Gold Project is at an early stage of exploration, and as such 
considered a high risk. The above interpretations and the following recommendations 
for work are based on the results of geochemical and geophysical surveys, which are 
subject to a wide range of interpretation, with limited percussion drilling. There are no 
specific risks that the author foresees that would impact continued exploration and 
development of the property. Although the author believes that the surveys on the 
property are scientifically valid, evaluating the geological controls on mineralization is 
hampered by a lack of rock exposure. At the present time and for the foreseeable 
future, the project is not generating any cash flow.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS AND BUDGET 

Based on: favourable geological setting (Dawson Range gold district); competent host 
rocks (Dawson Range batholith); structural complexity (evident within the airborne 
magnetic data, resistivity/induced polarization data and presence of linear younger 
dykes); significant gold soil anomalies with associated bismuth, ±tellurium, and 
peripheral arsenic, silver, ±antimony and lead; significant initial drill intercepts on the 
Trombley zone despite limited drilling; and similarities and proximity to Goldcorp's 
Coffee deposit and other significant gold discoveries within the Dawson Range and 
White gold districts, further work is recommended on the Rude Creek Gold Project.  

A two phase exploration program is recommended with Phase 1 consisting of: 
additional grid soil sampling in the Northeast and Trombley areas; and detailed 
mapping, prospecting and structural analysis including a detailed integration and 
interpretation of the airborne geophysical data.  

Sample density on the Northeast soil grid is only at 50m stations along 200m spaced 
lines. Infill east-west trending lines at a 100m spacing is initially recommended with 
25m sample stations and extension of the grid to the north, west, east and somewhat to 
the south to delineate the extent, and better constrain the orientation, of the gold soil 
anomalies. Additional grid soil sampling is also recommended on the Trombley soil grid. 
Infill sampling is recommended along 7 infill lines in the eastern grid area and can 
continue along north trending lines with a 50m sample spacing. Additional east-west 
lines are recommended to the north (2 lines) and south (1 line) at a 25m sample 
spacing on lines 100m apart.  

Detailed mapping and prospecting is recommended across the property with emphasis 
on the two grids and a structural and airborne geophysical analysis.  

An initial Phase 2 drill program, contingent on results from Phase 1, is recommended 
with 1,000m of RC drilling in about 5 to 6 holes with a helicopter supported rig to test the 
gold mineralization intersected in the RAB and RC drilling on the Trombley zone and the 
multiple northerly trending gold in soil anomalies at the Northeast zone, and/or 
additional soil anomalies generated in Phase 1.
