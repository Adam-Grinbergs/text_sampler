1 SUMMARY 

Bannerman Resources Limited (Bannerman) is exploring for uranium mineralisation at its 

Etango Project which lies within the Welwitschia tenement (EPL 3345) in the Erongo Province 

of Namibia.  The main uranium enriched zones in the Etango Project are the Anomaly A, 

Oshiveli and Onkelo Prospects; which were previously referred to as the Goanikontes area.  

These three prospects form a five kilometre long contiguous zone of uranium mineralisation. 

This report summarises the work undertaken as part of the mineral resource estimation 

studies, reported in July 2009, on Bannerman's Etango Uranium Project in Namibia.  

Bannerman currently has assets in Namibia (the Etango and Swakop River licences) and 

Botswana (the Dukwe, Serule North and Serule South licences).  Based upon the 

demonstrated potential of the Etango Project in Namibia, the other projects at Swakop River 

and in Botswana are currently not material assets of Bannerman (the Company) and only brief 

comments are provided on these projects. 

The Etango Project currently represents the most significant asset for Bannerman due to the 

advanced nature of exploration and the identified mineral resources at the Anomaly A, 

Oshiveli and Onkelo deposits therein.  Bannerman is currently continuing with uranium 

exploration within this Project area and has commenced a preliminary feasibility study into the 

viability of a mining and processing operation at the Etango Project.  References made to the 

mineral resource or the Etango mineral resource in this report include the Anomaly A, Oshiveli 

and Onkelo mineral resources. 

In July 2009, Coffey Mining estimated an updated resource for the combined Anomaly A, 

Oshiveli and Onkelo deposits which included 3.8Mt at 240ppm U3O8 of Measured Mineral 

Resources, 231.2Mt at 207ppm U3O8 of Indicated Mineral Resources and 120.7Mt at 

197ppm U3O8 of Inferred Mineral Resources, reported above a 100ppm U3O8 lower cutoff. 

Other areas within the tenement (EPL 3345), in the vicinity of the Etango Project, also have 

the potential to host additional uranium resources; especially in the southern portions of the 

lease where there is soil and colluvium cover and where Bannerman is about to commence 

exploration drilling activities.  The western flank of the Palmenhorst Dome, which incorporates 

the Anomaly A, Oshiveli and Onkelo deposits, constitutes a prospective strike length of over 

10km.

2 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

2.1 Scope of Work 

In June 2009, Coffey Mining Pty Ltd (Coffey Mining) was requested by Bannerman to update 

the resource estimate for the Etango Uranium Project which incorporates the Anomaly A, 

Oshiveli and Onkelo uranium deposits and prepare an Independent Resource Update. 

Coffey Mining has previously prepared an Independent Technical Report (ITR) on 

Bannerman's Namibian operations in 2007 and prepared updated resource and ITRs in 

January and September 2008 and February 2009. 

Bannerman currently has assets in Namibia (the Etango and Swakop River licences) and 

Botswana (the Dukwe, Serule North and Serule South licences). 

Based upon the demonstrated potential of the Etango Uranium Project, located on the Etango 

(previously called Welwitschia) licence in Namibia, the other projects at Swakop River and in 

Botswana are currently not considered to be significant material assets of the Company and 

only brief comments are provided on these projects. 

This report is intended to comply with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the 

Toronto Stock Exchange Manual, National Instrument 43-101, Companion Policy 43-101CP, 

and Form 43-101F1. 

This report complies with Canadian National Instrument 43-101, for the 'Standards of 

Disclosure for Mineral Projects' of December 2005 (the Instrument) and the resource and 

reserve classifications adopted by CIM Council in November 2004.  The report is also 

consistent with the 'Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 

Resources and Ore Reserves' of December 2004 (the Code) as prepared by the Joint Ore 

Reserves Committee of The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian 

Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia (JORC). 

Furthermore, this report has been prepared in accordance with the 'Code for the Technical 

Assessment and Valuation of Mineral and Petroleum Assets and Securities for Independent 

Expert Reports' of 2005 (the Valmin Code) as adopted by the Australasian Institute of Mining 

and Metallurgy (AusIMM).  The satisfaction of requirements under both the JORC and Valmin 

Codes is binding on the authors as Members of the Australasian Institute of Mining and

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Introduction 

4.1.1 Namibian Projects 

Bannerman, through a Namibian-registered subsidiary company, holds 80% of two exclusive 

prospecting licences within the central Swakopmund district of Namibia, which hosts the 

world's largest open cut uranium mine at Rössing (majority owned by Rio Tinto), and Paladin 

Resources Limited's Langer Heinrich uranium project. 

The Etango Uranium Project contains a number of identified uranium prospects and uranium 

anomalies.  The Anomaly A, Oshiveli, Onkelo (historically referred to as Rabbit Valley) and 

Rössingberg Anomalies are identified in historic reports and papers, dating from the 1970's.  

The Etango Project is based around the main three of the identified prospects (Anomaly A, 

Oshiveli and Onkelo).  The Etango Project contains alaskite hosted mineralisation similar to 

the significant Rössing open cut uranium mine, located 20km to the northeast, and is the 

subject of the current report. 

The Swakop River Exclusive Prospecting Licence surrounds Paladin Resources Ltd's Langer 

Heinrich uranium mine, which contains an extensive palaeochannel with carnotite 

mineralisation in calcrete and channel sediments.  Limited exploration drilling has been 

completed, targeting similar uranium mineralisation, within the Swakop River lease.  Swakop 

River is not currently considered to be a material asset of Bannerman and will be commented 

on only briefly. 

4.1.2 Botswana Projects 

Bannerman also holds three Prospecting Licences for uranium, precious metals, base metals 

and platinum group minerals in Botswana.  These licences are referred to as the Serule South, 

Serule North and Dukwe Licences and are located in the Foley and Sua Pan regions in 

Botswana.  These tenements total 1,153.9km² in area.  Bannerman's Botswana licences are 

not currently considered to be material assets of Bannerman and will not be commented on 

further. 

4.2 Background Information on Namibia 

Namibia is a stable, independent republic with a total surface area of 825,418km², situated 
north of South Africa, west of Botswana and south of Angola.  It is bordered to the west by the 

Atlantic Ocean (Figure 4.2_1).  Namibia forms part of the Southern African Region.  The 

following description is based largely upon information from the World Fact Book (The World 

Fact Book, 2007).

Etango Uranium Project 

Geography of Namibia 

 
 

Namibia gained independence from South African mandate on 21 March 1990 following multi-

party elections and the establishment of a constitution.  This independence was the outcome 

of a war fought by the South West Africa People's Organisation ('SWAPO'), against South 

African rule, that commenced in 1966 and a United Nations peace plan for the region that was 

agreed in 1988.  The inaugural President Sam Nujoma served for the first three terms 

(14 years) and was then succeeded by the current President Hifikepunye Pohamba, in March 

2005 following a peaceful election.  Namibia was the first country in the world to incorporate 

the protection of the environment into its constitution. 

The capital city of Windhoek has a population of 230,000 and is located in the Khomas Region 

in the centre of the country.  The largest harbour is located at Walvis Bay, on the central west 

coast, south of Swakopmund.  The country is mostly arid or semi-arid, comprising a high 

inland plateau bordered by the Namib Desert along the coast and the Kalahari Desert to the 

east. 

The population comprises approximately 87.5% indigenous people, 6% people of European 

descent and 6.5% of mixed origin.  About 50% of the population belong to the Ovambo tribe 

and 9% to the Kavangos tribe.  Other ethnic groups include the Herero (7%), Damara (7%), 

Nama (5%), Caprivian (4%), Bushmen (3%), Baster (2%) and Tswana (0.5%). 

The official language is English; however Afrikaans is the common language for most of the 

population and German is spoken by one-third of the population.  Various indigenous 



Bannerman Resources Limited 

July 2009 Resource Update  Page:  9 
Etango Uranium Project, Namibia – MINEWPER00614AE 
43.101 Technical Document – 31 August 2009 

languages are also spoken, including Oshivambo, Herero and Nama.  According to World 

Bank standards, 84% of the population is literate. 

The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction and processing of minerals for export.  

Mining accounts for approximately 25% of GDP.  Major operating metalliferous mines are 

present at Rössing (uranium), Skorpion (zinc), and Navachab (gold).  Namibia also has an 

important traditional subsistence agricultural sector. 

Namibia is serviced by a network of sealed highways connecting Windhoek in the central 

plateau region of Namibia with the coast at Walvis Bay, and with Botswana, Angola and South 

Africa.  Generally unsealed but well-maintained access roads provide regional access 

throughout Namibia and power is available via an extensive regional electricity grid originating 

in South Africa.  A railway line also extends from the port of Walvis Bay to Tsumeb, where a 

copper smelter is in operation.  Mobile phone communication is well established near most 

population centres. 

Water is potentially available to the various projects via underground resources within the 

major river systems, or can be supplied by pipeline from the coast.  The Government water 

authority, NamWater, provides assistance in the development of water resources for existing 

and potential new users. 

Areas within the Namib-Naukluft National Park, which includes the Etango and Swakop River 

Projects are granted for exploration, subject to appropriate environmental commitments. 

4.3 Mineral Tenure 

In Namibia, all mineral rights are vested in the State.  The Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) 

Act of 1992 regulates the mining industry in the country.  The Act has been designed to 

facilitate and encourage the private sector to evaluate and develop mineral resources.  The 

Mining Rights and Mineral Resources Division in the Directorate of Mining is usually the first 

contact for investors, as it handles all applications for and allocation of mineral rights in 

Namibia. 

An individual Exclusive Prospecting Licence (EPL) can cover an area of up to 1,000km² and 
the specific mineral group being explored for must be stated.  According to Section 140 of the 

Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act, 1992A, Part 5, uranium mineralisation is classified 

under the nuclear fuel minerals group.  This is defined as any 'source material containing - 

(a) uranium, expressed as uranium oxide (U3O8), of more than 0.006 per cent; (b) thorium, 

expressed as thorium oxide (ThO2), of more than 0.5 per cent, and of which the mass is more 

than a half kilogram'. 

An EPL is valid for an initial term of three years, with two renewals of two years each.  The 

size of the EPL should be reduced after three years and the size of the reduction is at the 

discretion of the Mining Commissioner.  There may be scope, if the Commissioner sees 

reason, to waive the reduction of the size of the EPL's after the initial three year period of the 

licences.  There is currently no set reduction size and an approved Mining Licence may count 

as a reduction in size of the EPL.

July 2009 Resource Update  Page:  10 
Etango Uranium Project, Namibia – MINEWPER00614AE 
43.101 Technical Document – 31 August 2009 

 
Section 67 of the Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act, 1992A details the rights of the holder 

of an EPL.  These include entitlement to carry out prospecting (in respect of the mineral group 

specified in the licence) and to remove mineral samples (except for sale or disposal and other 

than controlled minerals). 

Other licence types include: 

 Non-Exclusive Prospecting Licence ('NEPL') – Which are valid for 12 months and permit non-
exclusive prospecting on any open ground which is not restricted by other mineral groups. 

 Reconnaissance Licences ('RL') – Which allow remote sensing techniques and are valid for 
6 months. 

 Mineral Deposit Retention Licences ('MDRL') – Which allow the prospector to retain rights to 
mineral deposits that are uneconomic to exploit immediately, for future mining operations.  These 
are valid for up to 5 years and can be renewed subject to work and expenditure obligations for up 
to two years at a time. 

 Mining Licences ('ML') – Which allow the applicant to carry on mining operations.  These can be 
awarded to accredited agents, companies registered in Namibia or any Namibian citizen.  These 
are valid for life of the mine, or an initial period of up to 25 years, and are renewable for 
successive periods of up to 15 years. 

Granting of licences is determined by a committee and granting is based on the committee's 

perception as to the ability and intention of the applicant to complete exploration as outlined in 

the application and the validity of the proposed programme to determine resources.  Each 

licence must outline commodities of interest (in this case "Nuclear Fuels" covers uranium) and 

the licence granted only pertains to these commodities.  Therefore, overlapping licences for 

differing commodities may coexist.  Licences may list multiple commodity categories.  Grant 

determination takes between three to six months from the time of application. 

An environmental contract must be completed with the Department of Environment and 

Tourism by applicants for EPL's, MDRL's and ML's.  Environmental impact assessments 

(where relevant) must be made with respect to land disturbance, protection of flora and fauna, 

water supply, drainage and waste water disposal, air pollution and dust generation. 

4.4 Project Location 

4.4.1 The Etango Project Area (EPL 3345) 

The main focus of the Etango Uranium Project (formerly named Goanikontes) comprises the 

Anomaly A, Oshiveli and Onkelo Prospects, located approximately 41km (by road) east of the 

major town of Swakopmund and 47km northeast of the port town of Walvis Bay 

(Figure 4.4.1_1).

Figure 4.4.1_1 
Etango Project 

Namibian Project Locations and Regional Geology 

 
 

The sealed C14 highway connects Swakopmund to the port at Walvis Bay and the sealed B2 

highway connects Swakopmund to the Capital at Windhoek.  Access to the Etango Project, 

from Swakopmund, is gained via the B2 highway and then the partially sealed/unsealed C28 

road, then by well maintained unsealed road on the D1991 into the Namib-Naukluft National 

Park area.  The unsealed Welwitschia Drive then provides access to the project area. 

The Etango Uranium Project is situated on the flat Namib Desert sands of the Namib 

peneplain and approximately 5km south of the Swakop River.  To the north of the peneplain, 

erosion associated with the Swakop River has resulted in deeply incised gullies.

4.4.2 Swakop River Project Area (EPL 3346) 

The Swakop River project area (Figure 4.4.1_1) is located approximately 67km east of 

Swakopmund.  Access is gained by the sealed and unsealed C28 road, then by unsealed road 

into the Namib-Naukluft National Park area. 

The Swakop River project area is not currently considered to be a material asset of 

Bannerman and will not be discussed in any detail in the remainder of this document. 

4.5 Tenement Status 

4.5.1 Licences 

The Etango Project EPL 3345 and Swakop River EPL 3346 (Figure 4.4.1_1) are owned by the

On 17 December 2008, Bannerman announced that its Namibian subsidiary, Bannerman 

Mining Resources (Namibia) (Pty) Ltd (Bannerman Namibia), had entered into an agreement 

to settle the litigation previously brought by Savanna Marble CC (Savanna) and certain 

associated parties.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Savanna agreed to 

discontinue its review application in the High Court of Namibia by which Savanna had sought 

a declaration that the grant by the Minister of Mines and Energy of Namibia of EPL 3345, on 

which the Etango Project is situated, was void.  This settlement involves payments and the 

issue of shares to Savanna (as Bannerman has previously disclosed in public documents) and 

has removed the threat to Bannerman's title to the Etango Project. 

4.6 Royalties and Agreements 

4.6.1 Third Parties 

Bannerman owns 80% of Bannerman Namibia, which in turn holds EPL 3345 and EPL 3346.  

The remaining 20% is owned by another party (see Section 4.5.1). 

There are no other land holders over the area of the Anomaly A, Oshiveli and Onkelo 

Prospects (which contains Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources), and as such 

no royalties or agreements are required.  However, there are privately owned farms elsewhere 

within the area of EPL 3345.

Etango Uranium Project, Namibia – MINEWPER00614AE 
43.101 Technical Document – 31 August 2009 

 
4.6.2 Government Royalties 

According to Section 114, Part 1(c) of the Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act, 1992A, a 

royalty rate of 'not exceeding five per cent, as may be determined by the Minister from time to 

time by notice in the Gazette, of the market value, determined as provided in subsection (3), of 

such mineral or group of minerals' will be payable.  Section 114, Part 3, defines the market 

value as: 

a) determined in accordance with any term and condition, if any, of the licence of the holder 
concerned; or 

b) if no such term and condition exists, determined in writing by the Minister, having regard 
to the value agreed between the holder in question and the person to whom such mineral 
or group of minerals was sold or disposed of in an at arm's length sale and prices which 
were in the opinion of the Minister at the time paid on international markets for such 
mineral or group of minerals, less any amounts deducted in respect of fees, charges or 
levies which are in the opinion of the Minister charged on international markets. 

The mining royalty is currently stipulated by the Namibian Government to be 3% of revenue. 

4.7 Environmental Liabilities 

The southern portion of the Etango Project Area (EPL 3345) falls within the Namib-Naukluft 

National Park and the northern portion of the tenement falls within the West Coast 

Recreational Area. 

According to Speiser (2006), activities in the licence area are covered by a number of acts, 

policies and bills.  These include (amongst others): 

 The Namibian Constitution – Article 95. 

 The Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act, No 33 of 1992. 

 The Environmental Assessment Policy, 1994. 

 The Environmental Management Bill, 2004 

 South African Legislation still in force since Namibian independence in 1990 – Specifically the 
Nature and Conservation Ordinance, No. 4 of 1975. 

 The Policy for Prospecting and Mining in Protected Areas and National Monuments. 

A detailed Environment Clearance and Environmental Management Plan ('EMP') was 

required to be submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Tourism ('MET') to meet the 

environmental licensing of the Project.  The EMP was prepared by independent consultancy 

A. Speiser Environmental Consultants (ASEC) in July 2006 (Speiser, 2006).  The plan 

included a detailed summary of potential environmental impacts and a list of the mitigation 

measures that would be taken for access and works on the licence area.  A bi-annual 

environmental audit report is also required for the Project.  The EMP was approved on 

28th July 2006.

43.101 Technical Document – 31 August 2009 

Bannerman understands that the relevant Ministries allow mining and exploration in the park 

areas and is unaware of any current regulations that may significantly restrict access to the 

Projects areas for exploration.  It is important to note that other exploration and mining 

activities are currently underway within the Namib-Naukluft National Park by companies such 

as Extract Resources Limited (exploration activities) and Langer Heinrich Uranium Pty Ltd 

(uranium mining). 

4.8 Permitting Status 

The status of the EPLs is discussed in Section 4.5.1 and the EMP is discussed in Section 4.7.  

Other permits which are current include: 

 Park Entry Permits – Ministry of Environment and Tourism (Etango and Swakop River Areas).  
Visitors to the Namib-Naukluft National Park are required to obtain a park entry permit.  
Bannerman has ongoing Park Entry Permits (one for each employee) which are updated on an 
annual basis. 

 Water Abstraction Permit – Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry (Swakop River Area).  
Allows for the extraction of water from an existing borehole for mineral exploration on EPL 3346.  
This permit is valid until 15th September 2011 (Permanent Secretary, 2006).

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Project Access 

The Etango Project is located approximately 31 kilometres east of the major town of 

Swakopmund and 47 kilometres northeast of the port town of Walvis Bay (Figure 4.2_1).  Year 

round access to the Project area is gained by the sealed and unsealed C28 road from 

Swakopmund, then by well maintained unsealed road on the D1991 into the Namib-Naukluft 

National Park area. 

5.2 Physiography and Climate 

The Project area is located in the western region of the Namib Desert.  The bulk of the project 

area lies on the Namib Peneplain where there is poor soil development over eluvial, colluvial 

and alluvial material, and bedrock.  Due to the very low rainfall, these soils have gypsum 

crusts over large areas and vegetation in the area is very sparse, often consisting of lichen, 

low bushes or shrubs. 

The area of the Etango deposit is generally flat (Figure 5.2_1) with occasional low undulating 

hills with sparse sub-crop of bedrock.  Remnant shallow drainage channels in the desert can 

also be seen around the Project area.  The region around the Swakop River is characterised 

by deep gully erosion and exposure of outcrops of the underlying rock sequences.  There is 

good access to the areas of the desert plains and the Etango deposit, whilst access to areas 

of the river valleys can be difficult.

Rainfall in the area is very sporadic.  The highest annual rainfall in the last ten years occurred 

in March 2000 with 21.8mm of rainfall.  Figure 5.2_2 summarises the average monthly rainfall 

for the years 1996 to 2005.  The Project area also receives moisture from fogs which are 

caused when moist air which has been cooled by the Benguela oceanic current is blown on-

shore.  As a result of the moist air feeding off the Atlantic, the air along the coast line remains 

humid throughout the year (between 60% and >80% relative humidity).  The nearby town of 

Walvis Bay experiences more than 125 fog days per year (Speiser, 2006).

The Namib Desert region does not experience the extremes of temperatures that are typical to 

most other deserts, due to the presence of the cold current offshore.  However, the 

temperature can peak at over 40ºC in the summer months, while in the coldest month of 

August, the minimum can fall to 9ºC (Figure 5.2_3).  The hottest month on average is April 

with an average maximum temperature of 27ºC (Speiser, 2006).

5.3 Local Infrastructure and Services 

The town of Swakopmund (31km west of the Project area) has excellent services and 

infrastructure, with a population of approximately 28,000 people.  Services include financial, 

shopping, construction, trades and medical support.  The port city of Walvis Bay is located 

30km south of Swakopmund along the sealed C14 highway.  Locally trained technical and 

non-technical personnel are employed from Windhoek and Swakopmund, while expatriate 

workers in the area typically reside in Swakopmund.  Bannerman has an office and storage 

complex in Swakopmund which it uses as a base for the Etango Uranium Project.  Most other 

mining and exploration companies in the area also utilise Swakopmund as the base for their 

operations. 

Drilling services and water for the drilling are supplied by a local drilling contractor (Metzger 

Drilling) which owns the nearby Weitzenberg and Goanikonties Farms on the Swakop River.  

The national water utility, NamWater, has discussed plans with several mining companies to 

install a desalination plant to supply water for industrial purposes. 

Power lines are located near the Project area and the national power utility, NamPower, has 

plans to increase power supplies to the region to cope with expected future demand.  These 

plans include installation of the Caprivi Link Interconnector which will allow access to the 

electricity networks of Zambia, Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 

Mozambique.

6 PROJECT HISTORY 

The area of EPL 3345 has been the target of significant previous exploration which included 

both ground work (traverses and drilling) and aerial and ground based geophysical 

investigations. 

While uranium mineralisation was first discovered in the Central Zone of the Damara Orogen in the 
early 1900s, there was no further exploration in the area until the 1950s.  In the 1960s, Rio Tinto South 
Africa commenced an extensive exploration programme in the area; and a regional airborne radiometric 
survey and subsequent detailed spectrometer-magnetometer survey were conducted by the South West 
African Geological Survey in the 1970s. 

A broad uranium anomaly along the western flank of the Palmenhorst Dome was identified and this 
was followed up by an initial exploration programme in 1975.  From 1976 to 1978, Omitara Mines (a 
joint venture between Elf Aquitaine SWA and B & O Minerals) (Omitara) completed extensive 
reconnaissance drilling along the western Palmenhorst Dome position, with much of the work in the 
Anomaly A area. 

A dramatic decrease in the price of uranium in the 1980s resulted in exploration for uranium all 

but ceasing in the area (Mouillac et al, 1986) until 2005. 

In 2005 Turgi Investments (Pty) Ltd (Turgi) applied for and was granted the titles for uranium 

minerals over Licences 3345 and 3346.  The area around the Anomaly A, Oshiveli and Onkelo 

deposits was identified as being prospective, due to the earlier work completed, including a 

non-JORC resource reported for the area by Mouillac et al (1986).  Turgi later became 

Bannerman Mining Resources (Namibia) (Pty) Ltd which is 80% owned by Bannerman 

Resources Ltd. 

After acquiring its interest in the Welwitschia lease (EPL 3345) in 2006, Bannerman undertook a 
process of capturing and digitising the historic drillhole, geological mapping and ground geophysical 
data that was obtained from the Namibian Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of South 
Africa.  Airborne radiometric and geophysical data was purchased from the government and 
reprocessed for uranium, identifying anomalous trends along the western flank of the Palmenhorst 
Dome.  This dataset was part of the Erongo survey derived from an airborne survey conducted by 
World Geoscience in 1994/1995.  

Bannerman also sourced a high resolution Quickbird LandSat image that covers the region of 
EPL 3345.  A detailed mapping programme was then completed along the western and eastern flanks of 
the Palmenhorst Dome.  An extensive programme of reverse circulation (RC) and diamond drilling has 
since been completed at the Etango Uranium Project.  The main focus for this exploration has been to 
drill out and develop the Anomaly A, Oshiveli and Onkelo uranium prospects (in the previously 
explored Goanikontes area) and to determine continuity of mineralisation along strike, at depth and to 
the west of the Palmenhorst Dome.  The drilling completed is discussed in more detail in Section 11.2.

In April 2007, Bannerman estimated a maiden Inferred Resource of 56Mt at 219ppm U3O8 

above a 100ppm U3O8 lower cutoff (Inwood, 2007).  Subsequent resource estimation studies 

were completed in January and September 2008 and February 2009 (Inwood, 2009).  These 

estimates have now been superseded by the current resource estimation study.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Introduction 

Primary uranium mineralisation in the Etango Project area is related to uraniferous 

leucogranites, locally referred to as alaskites.  The alaskites are often sheet-like, and occur 

both as cross-cutting dykes and as bedding and/or foliation-parallel sills.  The sheet-like 

alaskites often amalgamate to form larger, composite granite plutons or granite stockworks, 

made up of closely-spaced dykes and sills.  These alaskite intrusions can be in the form of thin 

cm-wide stringers or thick bodies up to 200m in width. 

The alaskite bodies have intruded into the metasediments of the Nosib and Swakop Groups of 

the Damara Supergroup.  These metasediments and alaskite intrusions flank the 

Mesoproterozoic (1.7 - 2.0Ga) Palmenhorst Dome which is cored by partial melts of the 

Abbabis Metamorphic Complex. 

Six episodes or stages of Alaskite intrusions, from A (earliest) to F (last), have been 

recognised and classified by Nex, et al. (2001) of which the D and E types are significantly 

uranium mineralised, and form the bulk of the intrusions in the Project area. 

7.2 Regional Geology 

The Neoproterozoic (pre-550Ma) to early Palaeozoic (post 550Ma) Damara Orogen consists 

of a north-trending coastal branch, and a northeast-trending intracontinental branch which 

runs from Walvis Bay, through Namibia towards Botswana and Zimbabwe (Figure 7.2_1).  In 

Namibia the Damara Orogen has been interpreted as a result of the collision between the 

Congo, Kalahari and Rio de la Plata Cratons around 550-500Ma. 

Nex, 1997, suggests that events that led to the formation of the Damara Orogenic Belt can be 

summarised as follows: 

The pre-Gondwanaland continent rifted and the segments parted, accompanied by minor 

volcanic activity.  Fluvial material was deposited within the rift valley and, as the basin 

deepened, sedimentation evolved to include marine and carbonaceous sediments, marine or 

terrestrial glacial deposits, and argillaceous marine sedimentation. 

The tectonic regime then changed from divergence to convergence, including subduction, with 

the onset of a major orogenic event, including polyphase deformation and associated 

metamorphism and igneous activity. 

The 400km-wide inland branch of the Damara Orogenic Belt, between the Congo and Kalahari 

Cratons, is divided into a number of zones (Miller, 1983) based on lithostratigraphic, structural 

and metamorphic criteria.

The Central Zone (indicated in Figure 7.2_1 as the North Central zone (nCZ) and the South 

Central Zone (sCZ)) contains voluminous granites and gneisses, including basement Abbabis 

augen gneiss, synmetamorphic red granite, the Salem granite suites and late to post-

kinematic intrusions such as the Donkerhuk Granite (Basson & Greenway, 2004).  Domal 

structures are relatively widespread within the southern Central Zone (sCZ) and the Rössing, 

Palmenhorst and Ida Domes host notable uranium-enriched, sheeted leucogranites known as

alaskites.  This zone is characterized by elongate basement-cored domes, abundant granitoid 

intrusions and a metasedimentary cover sequence which has been metamorphosed at high 

temperature and low pressure to upper amphibolite–granulite facies (Miller, 1983 & Nex, et al., 

2002). 

During the Damara Orogenic event, the metasedimentary cover was subjected to numerous 

phases of deformation, commencing with an early folding (F1) which produced overturned and 

recumbent structures that were accompanied by thrusting and shearing.  The second major 

deformation event (D2) resulted in a prominent gneissosity (S2) and lineation (L2) which is 

close to parallel to the earlier S1 and S0 (bedding) layering.  This gneissosity was then further 

deformed by a later D3 deformation event which resulted in the elongate basement-cored 

domes which are characterized by constrictional fabrics.  Uraniferous alaskite sills and bodies 

that wrap around the Palmenhorst Dome are confined to dilational sites in the D2 high-strain 

zones, with the alaskite sills generally trending from north-northwest to north-northeast in 

strike and dipping to the west. 

The stratigraphy of the Damara Sequence is divided into two major groups: the basal Nossib 

Group (comprising the Etusis and Khan Formations) and the upper Swakop Group 

(comprising the Rössing, Chuos, Karibib and Kuiseb Formations).  The stratigraphy is 

summarised in Table 7.2_1 and for the Khan Formation is after Nex (1997); while the Rössing 

Formation is after Nash (1971).  The Damara Orogen is underlain by the gneissic and 

migmatitic lithologies of the Abbabis Metamorphic Complex.  A map of the region within and 

around EPL 3345 is shown in Figure 7.2_2.

7.3 Project Geology 

In the Etango Project, uranium occurrences are located along the western and eastern flanks 

of the Palmenhorst Dome (Figure 7.3_1).  The Palmenhorst Dome consists of pre-Damara 

basement, with a core of reddish leucocratic gneiss (quartz, microcline and accessory 

plagioclase biotite) that is commonly referred to as the 'red granite gneiss'.  The central gneiss 

is surrounded by migmatites and other basement rock types (Mouillac, et al., 1986). 

Sedimentary rocks of the Etusis Formation occur on the edges of the dome and comprise of 

arkosic quartzite.  The contact with the underlying units is transitional and migmatitic in nature.  

The upper boundary of the Etusis Formation is arbitrarily defined by the presence of dark 

biotite gneiss indicating the presence of the more pelitic Khan Formation (Mouillac, et al., 

1986). 

The Khan Formation can be subdivided into two units: the lower unit is characterised by dark 

grey biotite-amphibole-pyroxene schist and gneiss (with amphibolite and calc-silicate beds); 

while the upper unit is characterised by scattered quartz pebbles and is lighter in colour due to 

a higher quartz and feldspar content and a lower proportion of biotite, amphibole and 

pyroxene (Mouillac, et al., 1986). 

The Rössing Formation is not prominent in the immediate Anomaly A/Oshiveli/Onkelo area.  

Where present, it has a restricted lateral extent and consists of alternating sequences of 

diopside marble, quartzite and biotite-garnet schist (Mouillac, et al., 1986).

The Chuos Formation is traditionally described as a tillite and consists of pebbles and 

boulders of variable size and composition in a brown pelitic matrix.  The rocks have an 

aluminosilicate character and contain abundant biotite, sparse diopside and brownish green 

amphibole.  The Karibib and Kuiseb Formations are not found near the Anomaly A/Oshiveli 

deposit (Mouillac, et al., 1986).

A high-potassium, reddish granite referred to as the 'Red Granite' occurs between the 

migmatites and the Etusis Formation and as dykes and plugs in the Lower Khan Formation.  

This granite is a separate unit to the red granite gneiss found in the core of the dome 

(Mouillac, et al., 1986).  Figure 7.3_2 shows the mapped distribution of alaskites along the 

western flank of the Red Granite gneiss. 

The uraniferous sheeted leucogranite (SLG) bodies intrude a high strain zone between pre-

Damaran basement and the Damara metasedimentary sequence.  These bodies are generally 

referred to as alaskite, which is defined petrologically as a granitic rock that contains less than 

5% mafic minerals (Mouillac, et al., 1986).  Local variations in texture and mineral composition 

do occur and the composition can vary from alkali-feldspar granite to tonalite.   

Nex, et al. (2001) classified the alaskite into six different types, based on field characteristics of 

colour, grain-size, structural setting and mineralogy, to which he also assigned a chronological 

order (from A to F).  This type and chronological sequence is shown in Table 7.3_1.

The uraniferous intrusive alaskites are late-stage leucocratic granites that often have a 

pegmatitic texture.  Petrographically, an alaskite is granitic rock that contains less than 

5% mafic minerals (Mouillac, et al., 1986).  However, in the field local variations in texture and 

mineralogical composition are common and the composition can vary from alkali-feldspar 

granite to tonalite (Nex et al., 2001).  Mineralogically, the alaskites consist mainly of quartz 

and feldspar with minor, but variable accessory minerals.  Accessory minerals include 

ilmenite, biotite, apatite, topaz, garnet, tourmaline, uraninite, betafite, zircon, and monazite.  

Quartz varies in colour from colourless through smoky to almost black (indicating the presence 

of higher grade uranium mineralisation) (Batten, et al., 2007). 

Nex, et al. (2001) proposed a 6 stage classification scheme for the sheeted leucogranites 

(commonly referred to as alaskites) in the Anomaly A/Oshiveli/Onkelo area based upon field 

characteristics (Table 7.3_1).  The Type D and E alaskites are the principal host for uranium 

mineralisation within EPL 3345. 

The alaskites are associated with the regional F4 tectonic event and have intruded the Nosib 

and Swakop Group metasedimentary sequences.  They generally occur as bodies parallel to 

the main S3 foliation (but can sometimes be transgressive to the foliation) and can vary in 

thickness from a few centimetres to 100m.  The alaskite bodies can have a strike continuity of 

up to several hundred metres, although along the down-dip direction, they can exhibit 

bifurcation and can truncate after several tens of metres.  Crystallisation of the alaskites is 

interpreted to have occurred pre-, syn- and post- the regional F4 deformation (Mouillac, et al., 

1986).

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

Uranium mineralisation at the Anomaly A, Oshiveli and Onkelo deposits occurs within a 

stacked sequence of leucogranite (alaskite) dykes, of varying thickness, that have intruded 

into the host Damara Sequence of metasedimentary rocks.  This style of primary uranium 

mineralisation is commonly referred to as 'Rössing type' mineralisation.  Other nearby 

examples of this style of mineralisation include the Rössing uranium mine, the Valencia 

deposit, which is currently under development, and the Rössing South deposit which is under 

exploration.

9 MINERALISATION 

Uranium mineralisation in the Etango Project area is mainly located in the post-F3 alaskite 

granites.  Minor uranium mineralisation is also found in the metasedimentary sequences close 

to the alaskite contacts.  The major mineralised alaskite bodies are associated with the lower 

part of the Khan formation and occur within 400m of the contact between the Etusis and Khan 

Formations (Mouillac, et al., 1986). 

The sheeted alaskites have been classified into six types (A to F) by Nex, et al. (2001).  

Types A to C pre-date the D3 deformation event and are barren, while types D to F post-date 

the D3 deformation and contain elevated uranium levels.  Types D and E are considered to 

host the bulk of the uranium mineralisation at Anomaly A/Oshiveli/Onkelo.  Type D alaskites 

have a generally irregular and anatomising geometry, are white in colour, equigranular and 

contain smoky quartz, with accessory topaz.  Type E alaskites are recognised by a reddish 

colouration and the presence of ubiquitous 'oxidation haloes' (or 'alteration rings') which are 

irregular sub-circular features with a red rim and a grey core (Batten, et al., 2007).  These 

'alteration rings' are interpreted to have formed as oxidation fronts which have affected the 

distribution of uranium within the alaskite dykes (Mouillac, et al., 1986).  Smoky quartz is 

common and the reddened parts of the oxidation haloes may contain more biotite and Fe-Ti 

oxides than the rest of the alaskite (Batten, et al., 2007). 

Figure 9_1 shows the contact of an E-Type alaskite with the Khan Formation at the Onkelo 

deposit (historically referred to as Rabbit Valley) which is located at the northern end of the 

Anomaly A/Oshiveli/Onkelo deposit.  Note the banded biotite layers associated with elevated 

uranium grades along the alaskite contact in the inset photograph. 

The dominant primary uranium mineral is uraninite (UO2) but minor betafite 

(Ca,U)2(Ti,Nb,Ta)2O6(OH) is also present.  The primary uranium mineralisation occurs as 

disseminations within rock fractures, at crystal interfaces, and as inclusion within other 

minerals.  Secondary uranium minerals such as autunite (Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·10-12H2O) and 

uranophane (Figure 9_2) (Ca(UO2)2(SiO3OH)2·5H2O) occur as replacements to the primary 

minerals or as coatings along fractures.  The uraninite is commonly associated with chloritised 

biotite in the alaskites within the lower Khan Formation and with ilmenite and magnetite within 

foliated alaskites.  At higher uranium levels (e.g. 400ppm U3O8) the Th/U ratios have been 

found to be between 0.05 and 0.3.  Nuclides of the uranium decay series have been found to 

be in equilibrium or near-equilibrium (Mouillac, et al., 1986). 

Recent Scanning Electron Microscopy studies by Townend (2008) on the mineralised 

alaskites have also identified other uraniferous minerals such as: 

 Brannerite ((U,Ca,Ce)(Ti,Fe)2O6) occurring within the basal cleavage planes of biotite and 
chlorite; and  

 Thorium-uranium minerals such as uranothorite ((Th,U)SiO4) in apatite and plagioclase, polycrase 
((Y,Ca,Ce,U,Th)(Ti,Nb,Ta)2O6) in plagioclase and thorium uranium bearing monazite ((Ce, La, 
Nd, Th, U, Y)PO4).

The southern part of the deposit has been affected by the Namib peneplanation which has 

resulted in the leaching of uranium from generally a few metres up to ten metres from surface 

(Mouillac, et al., 1986).  Further details of the mineralisation are discussed in Section 17.

10 EXPLORATION 

10.1 Previous Exploration  

The following section is based upon information from Speiser (2006), Batten, et al. (2007), 

Mouillac, et al. (1986) and Roesener and Schreuder (1997).  Exact details on some of the 

historic exploration programmes were not available at the time of this report. 

Regionally, uranium mineralisation was first discovered in the Central Zone in the 1900s when 

uranium-bearing beryl (heliodor) was discovered near Rössing Mountain.  Exploration in the 

area lapsed until the 1950s and in the 1960s Rio Tinto South Africa commenced intensive 

exploration in the area. 

In the 1970s the then South West African Geological Survey conducted a regional 

reconnaissance airborne radiometric survey that was followed by a further detailed 

spectrometer-magnetometer survey in 1974 over an area exceeding 100,000ha.  Analysis of 

the airborne survey identified a broad thorium and uranium/thorium anomaly along the 

western flank of the Palmenhorst Dome.  Prospect scale exploration within the Etango project 

area commenced in 1975 with 134 percussion holes being drilled in the Anomaly A area.  The 

exploration by previous owners was not conducted on behalf of or by Bannerman and little 

information remains available on this work. 

10.1.1 Omitara Mines 

From 1976 to 1978, Omitara Mines (a joint venture between Elf Aquitaine SWA and B & O 

Minerals) (Omitara) drilled 224 mostly vertical percussion drillholes on a reconnaissance grid 

of 400m north by 75m to 100m east along the western Palmenhorst Dome position and a 

reduced grid in some areas of 200m to 100m by 75m near the Anomaly A area.  The 

percussion drillholes totalled 13,383m with depths ranging from 50 to 100m.  An additional 

9 diamond drillholes were drilled for a total of 2,100m. 

Holes drilled during this period were analysed variably by chemical assaying (X-ray 

fluorescence) and downhole gamma-ray spectrometry (calibrated at Pelindaba).  Chemical 

assay results in the region of Anomaly A ranged up to the low thousands of ppm U3O8. 

A total of 6,800m of trenching was completed using a Poclain Excavator to obtain exposure of 

the alaskites which were under the superficial cover of the Namib plain in the southwest of the 

Project area.  The remnants of the trenching can still be seen today.  Omitara also performed 

airborne radiometric surveys. 

Mouillac, et al. (1986) mentions that by the beginning of 1978 "potential reserves are 

estimated to be several tens of millions of tons with a low average ore-grade". 

The leases were relinquished in 1981.

10.1.2 Western Mining Group (Pty) Ltd 

From 1982 to 1986 Western Mining Group (Pty) Ltd conducted regional mapping and drilled 

22 percussion drillholes for 1,017m and conducted surface scintillometer surveys. 

A resource was estimated in 1986, but no historic figures are available.  As a result of a 

dramatic decrease in the price of uranium in the 1980s exploration for this commodity all but 

ceased until 2005. 

10.1.3 Others 

According to verbal reports, Anglo American performed some exploration work in the northern 

portion of the area in the 1970s and Rio Tinto South Africa drilled three anomalies south of the 

Rössingberg Dome in the 1970's. 

10.2 Exploration by Bannerman Resources 

After acquiring the lease in 2005, Bannerman undertook a process of capturing and digitising 

the historic drillhole and mapping data for the area.  This data was mainly obtained from the 

Namibian Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of South Africa. 

10.2.1 Airborne and Ground Geophysics 

In 2006, airborne radiometric and geophysical data was purchased from the government and 

reprocessed for uranium, identifying anomalous trends along the western flank of the 

Palmenhorst Dome and the eastern flank of the Rössingberg Dome.  The dataset was part of 

the Erongo survey that was flown by World Geoscience in 1994/1995.  The survey recorded 

256 channel radiometric data with a sodium iodide (NaI) crystal detector and was flown north-

south on 200m line spacing, with a nominal terrain clearance of 80m. 

The results from the historic surface-scintillometer survey were digitised by Bannerman and 

imported into geographic information system (GIS) software for interpretation. 

Bannerman has also sourced a high resolution Quickbird LandSat image that covers the 

region of EPL 3345.  Re-processing of the image in the areas near the Swakop River has 

enabled exposure of the alaskites to be made readily identifiable as an aid for further mapping 

and target generation (Figure 10.2.1_1).  A lease-scale, 5m contour, surface digital terrain 

model ('DTM') has been created which covers the area of the lease. 

Ground radiometric surveys have been completed by G Symons Geophysics over certain 

target areas on the eastern side of the Rössing Dome and to the south and east of the 

Palmenhorst Dome.  The ground radiometric surveys were conducted on a 40m to 80m line 

spacing.

An Aerial LIDAR Survey was completed south of the Swakop River in EPL 3345 during 

September 2008.  The survey was done by Southern Mapping Company from South Africa 

using an aircraft mounted LIDAR system that scanned the surface with a 70kHz laser resulting 

in a dense Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of the area.  Digital colour images were also taken 

from the aircraft to produce accurate orthophoto's of the area.

A Horizontal loop EM (HLEM) survey was conducted over certain areas of EPL 3346 to 

investigate ground radiometric targets, and to confirm the presence of any associated 

palaeochannels.  Equipment used for the survey was a Max Min II Horizontal loop EM using 

100m coil spacing and 4 frequencies, namely 888Hz, 3.5kHz, 7.5kHz and 14 kHz.  Readings 

were collected at 25 and 50m station spacings at the abovementioned frequencies on 

selected lines. 

10.2.2 Re-logging of Historic Diamond Holes 

The core from nine historic diamond drillholes was located and re-logged (GOADH001 – 

GOADH009).  Unfortunately government restrictions meant that the core could not be re-

assayed chemically. 

10.2.3 Mapping 

Regional mapping over the Project area is ongoing and detailed mapping over the Anomaly 

A/Oshiveli/Onkelo deposit has been completed.  Certain areas of interest throughout the EPL 

have also been mapped in fine detail in zones of some 100m by 200m. 

10.2.4 Verification Drilling and Re-Surveying  

In 2006/2007, Bannerman drilled 43 RC drillholes (GARC001-GARC043) and 13 diamond core 

drillholes (GOADH0010 – GOADH0022) over the area of the Etango deposit.  Using the results 

from the verification drilling, in April 2007, Bannerman conducted a study to confirm the 

veracity of the historic drillhole data along the 1.7km strike of the Anomaly A/Oshiveli resource 

area.  This study included comparing the results from the 13 diamond holes drilled by 

Bannerman to 40 nearby historic drillholes, and the re-probing of 19 historic drillholes using an 

ElectroMind optical / scintillometer / deflection probe and a spectrometer probe (operated by G 

Symons Geophysics) (see Section 14.1). 

The ElectroMind probe has a ½ inch by 1¾ inch NaI crystal.  It operates using two systems; 
one is a scintillometer measuring total count and the second system is a 3 channel 

spectrometer measuring total count K, U and Th channels.  Bannerman also uses an Auslog 

scintillometer (27mm diameter, ½ inch by 1¾ inch NaI crystal) which measures total count 

only. 

Bannerman concluded that the historic assaying data was accurate and suitable for use in 

estimation studies.  However, none of the historic drilling data or geological data has been 

used in the current resource estimate. 

10.2.5 Resource Estimation and Drilling by Bannerman Resources 

An initial Inferred Mineral Resource was estimated by Bannerman for the Anomaly A deposit, 

based on the historic and recent drilling, in May 2007.  Bannerman has since continued an 

aggressive drilling programme over the resource area from April 2007 up to the present time, 

with this work remaining underway.  All of these drilling and exploration works are supervised 

by Bannerman staff geologists.

In January and August 2008, Coffey Mining independently estimated Mineral Resources for the 

Anomaly A/Oshiveli area based only on the recent Bannerman drilling.  A further Coffey Mining 

Mineral Resource estimate was then completed in February 2009 and this is now again updated 

by the current Coffey Mining Mineral Resource estimate in July 2009 (see Section 17). 

Exploration on EPL 3345 is focussed on the expansion of the existing mineral resource along 

strike to the north of Anomaly A, at Oshiveli and Onkelo, and to the south at Ondjamba.  The 

Oshiveli and Onkelo anomalies have been the target of previous exploration which included 

drilling as well as aerial and ground geophysical investigations. 

10.3 Exploration Data Collection 

Little information is available regarding data collection from previous owners.  The data 

collection practices employed by Bannerman are outlined in Sections 11 and 12.

11 DRILLING 

11.1 Drilling by Previous Owners 

The drilling by previous owners has been outlined in Section 10.1.  Historic drilling in the 

region of the Etango deposit was typically performed on a 400m north by 75m to 100m east 

grid with further infill drilling completed to a nominal 100m north by 75m to 100m east spacing, 

and some to 100m by 25m.  Figure 11.1_1 shows the location of drilling completed by 

Bannerman for the current resource estimate.

11.2 Drilling by Current Owners 

As of mid-July 2009, Bannerman had drilled a total of 628 RC and 72 diamond drillholes for a total of 
187,635m over the area of the Anomaly A/Oshiveli resource.  The RC drillholes range from 23m to 
480m in depth and the diamond drillholes range from 84m to 528m in depth.  A total of eleven diamond 
holes were drilled for metallurgical testing purposes, nine for geotechnical testing purposes and four for 
hydrogeological purposes.  Lithological contacts were considered whilst modelling for these holes 
which were not assayed.  The drillhole database for Onkelo consists of 57 RC holes for 11,913m.  The 
RC drillholes were drilled by Metzger Drilling using a bit diameter of 4.72" to 5.5".  The bulk of 
the RC drilling has been designed on a nominal 50m by 50m, to 50m by 100m drill spacing.  
The bulk of the 50m by 50m drilling has targeted the area of the likely open-mineable 
resource.  Drilling along strike and down-dip of the main mineralisation has targeted 
extensions to the mineralised zones and has been drilled on a nominal 100m by 50m spacing. 

The majority of the diamond drilling for resource delineation and grade estimation purposes 
was drilled using NQ diameter core barrels (47.6mm core).  Nine holes were drilled using a 
NQ3 core barrel (45.1mm core) for purely geotechnical purposes.  All geotechnical samples 
were sent to Rocklab in Johannesburg for testwork.  The majority of the core is orientated by 
spearing each run 

Ten drillholes were also completed in HQ core diameter (63.5mm core) for metallurgical 
testwork; and the whole HQ core was sent to Ammtec Laboratories in Perth. 

Selected significant drill intercepts for the Bannerman RC and diamond drilling are presented 

in Tables 11.2_1 and 11.2_2 for diamond and RC drilling respectively.  Further statistics 

regarding the Anomaly A/Oshiveli samples are discussed in Section 17.3.2.  Due to the 

shallow dip (approximately -30° to -44º to the west) of the mineralised alaskites and the angle 

of intercept of the RC and diamond drillholes, the true thickness of the significant intercepts is 

close to the stated mineralised interval. 

Drilling of other target areas within EPL 3345 is in progress and to date 159 RC drillholes have 

been completed at the Rössingberg, Ombuga, Gohare, Ondjamba, and Ombepo prospect 

areas (Figure 11.2_1) including 87 sterilisation drillholes in the proposed Plant and TSF areas.

11.3 Surveying 

All drillhole collars are surveyed by licensed surveyors after drilling. 

For diamond drillholes, downhole surveys were taken using an Eastman single shot camera at 

nominal 30m intervals up to drillhole GOADH0022.  The practice is now for all drillholes to be 

surveyed by a Verticality magnetic survey tool performed by G Symons Geophysics/terratec 

(G Symons).

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

The exact sampling methods used for the historic drilling are not available and are not 

considered relevant to this report, as this drilling has not been included.  For the Omitara 

drilling, the percussion holes were typically sampled on 1m intervals.  When taken, chip 

samples were assayed by X-ray fluorescence.  Downhole gamma ray spectrometry was also 

taken for selected intervals from most of the drillholes. 

The following discussion details the sampling methods used by Bannerman.  Bannerman 

routinely sample all intersected alaskite intervals.  The location of the sampling for the 

resource studies is shown in Figure 11.1_1. 

12.1 RC Drilling 

The following methodology is applied to the RC drillhole sampling: 

 Drill samples are collected off the rig cyclone in large plastic bags at 1m intervals.  The sample 
bags are pre-marked and tags are also prepared for the laboratory sample which identifies the 
sample number (Figure 12.1_1A). 

 The 1m sample is split in the field by Bannerman staff using a 75/25 riffle splitter 
(Figure 12.1_1B) and the 75% sample is placed into a bulk sample bag from which rock chip 
samples are taken and placed into a chip tray for logging by the geologist.

Sampling details are sent to the assaying laboratories electronically as well as a paper copy 

which is sent with the samples.  A sample submission sheet is sent with each sample 

dispatch: 

 The primary sample sent to the laboratory is obtained by splitting the 25% sample until a sample 
of approximately 500g to 1kg is obtained.  A count per minute (CPM) reading is taken from this 
sample using a handheld scintillometer and recorded along with the sample condition (wet, dry, 
and moist).  If the bulk sample is wet, a spear sample is taken. 

 The sample that is to be sent to the laboratory for analysis is placed into a clear plastic bag that is 
labelled with the drillhole identification and sample depth.  A collection of the samples are placed 
into larger plastic bags for transport to the secure sample storage facility in Swakopmund 
(Figure 12.1_1). 

 A library reference sample is obtained by again splitting the reject of the 25% split until another 
500g to 1kg sample is obtained.  The reference sample is stored in Bannerman's warehouse in 
Swakopmund. 

 Sample sheets are drawn up by the responsible geologist and given to the Senior Field 
Technician.  He assigns the sample string numbers to the relevant samples.  The primary sample is 
transferred into a new clear plastic bag which has the reference sample number written on the bag 
and a sample stream ticket is placed within the bag. 

 Samples are sent from the secure sample storage facility in Swakopmund (Figure 12.1_2) to SGS 
Lakefield in Johannesburg (SGS Johannesburg') and Genalysis Laboratory Services in 
Johannesburg (Genalysis Johannesburg') three time a week via Coastal Couriers.  Field duplicate 
samples sourced from the 75% reject are taken at the rate of 1 in every 20 primary samples.  The 
sampling method is the same as used for the primary sample.  Field duplicate samples are sent to 
Genalysis Johannesburg and since 12/01/2009 to SGS Johannesburg for assaying. 

 Since December 2008, samples are sent from the secure sample storage facility in Swakopmund to 
the SGS Sample Preparation Facility in Swakopmund.  The sample is prepared by SGS and sent to 
their relevant facilities in Johannesburg for assaying. 

 The RC chips trays are stored in a separate secure facility in Swakopmund (Figure 12.1_3).  Since 
December 2007, standards and blanks have been routinely inserted into the sampling stream at a 
nominal rate of 1:20.

12.2 Diamond Drilling 

The following methodology is applied to the diamond drillhole samples: 

 After drilling, the diamond core is placed into core trays by the drilling contractor. 

 The core is then taken to the Bannerman core logging and storage facility in Swakopmund 
(Figure 12.1_2) where it is orientated, measured, marked for sampling and logged by the staff 
geologists. 

 Sample intervals are determined by the geologist after logging.  The sample lengths are nominally 
1m; however shorter intervals are sampled where a lithological boundary is intersected.  No 
sampling is undertaken across lithological boundaries.   

 Up to drillhole GOADH0022, the core was cut in half using a diamond saw, with the primary 
sample sent to SGS Johannesburg for crushing and analysis.  Subsequent to GOADH0022, only 
quarter core is used for primary analysis.  The core depths (in metres), sample intervals and 
sample numbers are marked on the core for later identification (Figure 12.2_1). 

 Field duplicates are taken for every 20th sample.  Where a field duplicate is taken, ¼ core 
is submitted to the laboratory.  One ¼ sample is sent to SGS Johannesburg for primary 
analysis, whilst the other ¼ sample is sent to Genalysis Johannesburg for preparation.  
Since January 2009 all field duplicates are sent to SGS Johannesburg for assaying.  As with the 
RC samples, the diamond samples are placed in numbered bags for dispatch.

12.3 Adequacy of Procedures 

The drilling, sampling and storage procedures used by Bannerman meet industry acceptable 

standards.  The samples are considered to be of good quality and representatively for the 

purposes of mineral resource estimation. 

RC samples observed in the field were of suitable size and generally of consistent high 

recovery.  Coffey Mining previously recommended that the RC sample recovery be routinely 

recorded and entered into the drillhole database.  Based on this recommendation, Bannerman 

field staff undertook an analysis the RC sample recovery in 2008.  The samples were weighed 

before they were split and all samples returned a weight ±20kg.  The rocks in the mineral 

resource area are competent with very little cavities.  Based on the results of the investigation 

Bannerman determined that a routine recording of this data was superfluous.  

It is worth noting that recovery is recorded and entered into the drillhole database from all the 

diamond holes.  From this data it is clear that the rock is very competent with very little risk of 

sample loss.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

13.1 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

13.1.1 SGS 

All primary RC and diamond core samples are sent to SGS Johannesburg for crushing, 

pulverisation and chemical analysis.  Since December 2008, all field duplicate samples are sent 

to the SGS sample preparation facility in Swakopmund.  Pulverised samples are then couriered 

to SGS in Johannesburg for analysis.  SGS Johannesburg is a SANAA accredited laboratory 

(T0169).  Samples are analysed by pressed pallet X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for U (U3O8 is then 

calculated from the U analysis), Nb, Th and borate fusion with XRF for Ca and K.  Analysis for 

Ca and K was discontinued in March 2009.  Upon arrival at SGS Johannesburg, a barcode is 

attached to the sample to enable tracking during the preparation and analysis process.  The 

primary sample is dried in an electric oven at ~105° then crushed to -2mm, then pulverised using 

a Labtech LM2 pulveriser to 95% passing 75µm. 

Barren rock is run through the crushing and pulverisation circuit after every sample.  The last 

barren rock sample from each batch is analysed using XRF and reported to the client. 

After pulverisation, a 200g sub-sample is taken.  From this sub-sample approximately 20g is 

taken for XRF analysis and 0.5g to 2g for inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry 

analysis.  Typically SGS Johannesburg will conduct ICP analysis in conjunction with XRF 

analysis on every fifth submitted sample. 

SGS Johannesburg introduces standards and blanks at the rate of 1:22 into the sample stream.  

Replicate samples from the 200g pulverised sub-samples are taken at the rate of 2:20. 

A pulp duplicate sample is sent to Genalysis Johannesburg at the rate of 1 sample in every 20. 

For U3O8 (actually U), Nb and Th XRF analysis, a 17g (approximately) sample is combined with 

approximately 3g of wax binder then pressed for 2 minutes to produce a compact pellet.  The 

pellet press is cleaned using a vacuum blow after each press.  Bannerman samples are 

analysed using a Panalytical Axios XRF machine. 

For Ca and K between 0.2g to 0.7g of sample is mixed with a borate flux and cast followed by 

analysis by XRF (discontinued in April 2009).  During periods of high demand, some 200g 

sachets may be sent to SGS Perth for XRF analysis.  The procedures used in the SGS Perth 

laboratory are similar to those used in the SGS Johannesburg laboratory. 

13.1.2 Genalysis 

Sample preparation at Genalysis Johannesburg consists of drying the sample at ~105° C then 

milling the entire sample in a LM2 mill.  Barren silica flush is put through the mill after each 

sample.  Every 20th pulverised sample is screen checked to determine the percentage passing 

-75µm.

July 2009 Resource Update  Page:  49 
Etango Uranium Project, Namibia – MINEWPER00614AE 
43.101 Technical Document – 31 August 2009 

U3O8 (actually U), Th and Nb are determined by pressed pallet XRF using a Philips PW1480, 

PW1400 and PW2400 Axios machine.  Samples are prepared using 20g of sample with 3g of 

binder which are mixed in a grinding vessel for 4 minutes and pressed in a 20 tonnes hydraulic 

press. 

One duplicate is re-analysed for every 20 samples and one reference standard is inserted for 

every 20 samples.  One reagent blank is inserted per shift. 

13.1.3 Density 

Bulk density determinations are taken by Bannerman staff using either the water immersion or 

calliper method on diamond core billets.  Density estimates have also been made on selected 

pulp samples from the RC drilling programmes using the gas pycnometer method by 

Genalysis Perth. 

13.1.4 Security 

The diamond core and RC samples that are to be sent for assaying are stored in Bannerman's 

secure storage facility in Swakopmund prior to pick up via courier.  All crushing, pulverising 

and splitting of the samples subsequent to the generating of the field splitting is performed by 

a reputable assaying laboratory.  RC samples are taken daily from the field to the storage 

facility after the initial field splitting. 

13.1.5 Adequacy of Procedures 

Drilling and sampling operations are supervised by Bannerman geologists and samples are 

promptly bagged and taken to the storage facility in Swakopmund prior to shipment to the 

assay laboratory.  It is considered that Bannerman currently has appropriate provisions in 

place to safeguard the sample security. 

Coffey Mining have visited the SGS Johannesburg facility and considers it to be well run and 

that the preparation and analytical methods used by SGS Johannesburg are appropriate. 

13.2 Quality Control Procedures 

13.2.1 Umpire Pulp Checks 

Umpire pulp check samples are taken at the rate of 1 in every 20 from primary samples at 

SGS Johannesburg.  The umpire pulp samples are analysed at Genalysis in Perth by XRF.  

The check sample intervals are determined by the logging geologist and the identification 

details are emailed to both laboratories in question. 

13.2.2 Field Re-Splits 

Field re-split samples are sent to Genalysis Johannesburg for preparation, and then a sub-

sample of pulverised material is sent to Genalysis Perth for assaying by XRF.  Since January 

2009 field duplicates are analysed at SGS in Johannesburg.

43.101 Technical Document – 31 August 2009 

13.2.3 Standards and Blanks 

Bannerman has obtained and uses standard samples from the following sources: 

 Two certified uranium standards made from Bannerman pulp reject samples sent to SGS. 

 Two commercial standards sourced from Witwatersrand material. 

These standards are currently inserted at a rate of 1:20 samples. 

SGS Johannesburg inserts certified standards as part of the laboratory based QAQC system.  

The barren crush at the end of each batch is also analysed and the results reported. 

Genalysis Perth inserts certified standards as part of its internal QAQC procedures. 

13.2.4 Adequacy of Procedures 

After the initial submitting of the sample to the laboratories, all sample preparation is undertaken 

by independent laboratory staff.  Bannerman currently employ appropriate protocols with the 

routine collection and submission of standards, field duplicates, pulp duplicates and the analysis 

of these samples by an umpire assay laboratory (Genalysis Perth).  Laboratory replicate data is 

also captured in the current database system.

14 DATA VERIFICATION 

The quality control analysis of the Bannerman assaying information has relied upon field 

duplicates, pulp duplicates, blanks and standards submitted by Bannerman to an umpire 

laboratory and internal laboratory replicates, blanks and duplicate samples. 

14.1 Collar and DTM Survey 

A topographic survey has been conducted over the project area.  The survey was performed 

by licensed surveyors using the following main instruments: 

 Six Ashtech dual frequency GPS receivers. 

 Leica RTK 1200 GPS System (two receivers)  

 Leica TC1000 single second Total Station with 3" accuracy. 

 Leica TC600 single second Total Station with 5" accuracy. 

All survey controls were surveyed and calibrated using the Post Processing method employing 

the Ashtech GPS receivers and the "Ashtech Solutions" proprietary software. 

Most of the drillhole collars were surveyed prior to the resource estimate using the Leica RTK 

GPS or the Leica Total Stations. 

14.2 Assessment of Quality Control Data 

The quality control data related to RC and diamond core drilling has been assessed 

statistically using a number of comparative analyses for each dataset.  The objectives of these 

analyses were to determine relative precision and accuracy levels between various sets of 

assay pairs and the quantum of relative error.  The results of the statistical analyses are 

presented as summary statistics and plots, which include the following: 

 Thompson and Howarth Plot, showing the mean relative percentage error of grouped assay pairs 
across the entire grade range, used to visualise precision levels by comparing against given control 
lines. 

 Rank % HARD Plot, which ranks all assay pairs in terms of precision levels measured as half of 
the absolute relative difference from the mean of the assay pairs (% HARD), used to visualise 
relative precision levels and to determine the percentage of the assay pairs population occurring at 
a certain precision level.  For pulp-based duplicate samples, a limit of 10% HARD is a useful limit 
to compare and analyse precision from different datasets.  For field duplicates, a limit of 20% 
HARD is a useful limit to compare and analyse precision from different datasets. 

 Mean vs. % HARD Plot, used as another way of illustrating relative precision levels by showing 
the range of % HARD over the grade range.

July 2009 Resource Update  Page:  52 
Etango Uranium Project, Namibia – MINEWPER00614AE 
43.101 Technical Document – 31 August 2009 

 
 Mean vs. %HRD Plot is similar to the above, but the sign is retained, thus allowing negative or 

positive differences to be computed.  This plot gives an overall impression of precision and also 
shows whether or not there is significant bias between the assay pairs by illustrating the mean 
percent half relative difference between the assay pairs (mean % HRD). 

 Correlation Plot is a simple plot of the value of assay 1 against assay 2.  This plot allows an 
overall visualisation of precision and bias over selected grade ranges.  Correlation coefficients are 
also used. 

 Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot is a means where the marginal distributions of two datasets can be 
compared.  Similar distributions should be noted if the data is unbiased. 

 For standards and blanks, the Standard Control Plot shows the assay results of a particular 
reference standard over time.  The results can be compared to the expected value, and the ±10% 
precision lines are also plotted, providing a good indication of both precision and accuracy over 
time. 

14.2.1 Standards Analysis 

This section will discuss the analysis of both the Bannerman and laboratory inserted 

standards. 

Bannerman Submitted Standards 

Bannerman has routinely inserted blanks and certified standards into their sampling stream 

since December 2007.  The standards include two certified commercial standards by African 

Mineral Standards (AMIS) (AMIS0029 and AMIS0045) sourced from the Dominion Reef and 

Witwatersrand area; and two AMIS certified standards sourced from Anomaly A mineralised 

material (ANMIS0085 and AMIS0086).  The standards ANMIS0085 and AMIS0086 were 

prepared by AMIS for commercial use and have been subject to an international round robin test 

regime. 

All of the datasets analysed exhibited multiple instances (quantum in the 10's) of outlying data.  

The bulk of these outliers matched values for existing standards and are assumed to be 

present due to the mixing of standards during the submission/sample recording process and 

were trimmed from the analysis for each population.  The summary statistics for these 

standards are presented in Table 14.2.1_1.  Summary control plots are in Appendix 1. 

It is noted that standard AMIS0029, which is sourced from the Dominion Reef, has a known 

complex mineralogy and metallurgy which may be affecting the EV of the batches analysed.  

Both Genalysis Perth and SGS Perth exhibit similar positive biases up to June 2008 where after 

no more of these standards were submitted to SGS Johannesburg (See Appendix 1). 

The AMIS standards submitted by Bannerman to SGS Johannesburg (the primary laboratory) 

exhibit a positive bias ranging from 3% to 8%, whereas the same standards submitted to the 

Umpire laboratory (Genalysis) exhibit 0 to 1% bias.  With the exception of AMIS0029 (which has 

known issues) the SGS standards report >90% within the tolerance limits.

% Bias 4 1 8 1 3 4 35 

 
The bulk of the blanks reported less than 5ppm U.  However, even with trimming of obvious 

outliers (e.g. results close to values of known standards), some 13 assays reported greater 

than 10ppm U and up to 108ppm U.  It is suspected that some of the higher grade results may 

reflect the mixing of blanks with actual samples during the sampling process; and that some of 

the elevated grades may be due to sample contamination. 

SGS Internal Standards 

Two separate blank standards (Waste Rock and Lab Blank) and three internal certified 

standards (UREM2, UREM4 and UREM9) were identified in the database for SGS 

Johannesburg.  One blank standard (Waste Rock) and one certified standard (SY3) were 

identified for SGS Perth.  The summary statistics for these standards are shown below in 

Table 14.2.1_2.  Summary control plots are in Appendix 1.

For SGS Perth, the certified standards display acceptable accuracy, with the bulk of the 

assays within the expected value range and no significant bias indicated.  The three internal 

standards for SGS Johannesburg all report within tolerance limits, but all three standards 

exhibit a slight positive bias of 2% to 4%.  This trend is in line with that seen for the 

Bannerman submitted standards.

July 2009 Resource Update  Page:  54 
Etango Uranium Project, Namibia – MINEWPER00614AE 
43.101 Technical Document – 31 August 2009 

The blank standard Waste-Rock (n=1,336) from SGS Johannesburg exhibits some minor 

contamination throughout the sample runs, with seven samples reporting above 5ppm U.  The 

laboratory blank (n=5,786) reports consistently at 0ppm U.  The blank samples do not indicate 

any significant contamination during the assaying process. 

The blank standard Waste Rock from SGS Perth (n=196) has 9 samples over 5ppm U3O8, 

indicating minor contamination.  The results are considered acceptable. 

Genalysis Perth Internal Standards 

Five internal standards (BL-1, SARM1, UREM2, 4 and 9) and one laboratory blank were 

identified in the database.

All of the standards except SARM1 report good accuracy with the bulk of the samples 

returning assays within the set precision limits.  Bias in the laboratory standards ranged from  -

2% to 1.8%.  Control blank standards (n=187) were identified for analysis (see Appendix 1).  

None of the results for these exhibited significant contamination. 

14.2.2 Duplicates and Umpire Assaying Analysis - Precision 

The database for the Etango deposit contains duplicate sample information for field re-splits 

(RC and ¼ core diamond), umpire pulp re-assays and laboratory pulp replicate assays.  No 

intra-laboratory pulp re-splits were identified. 

For the SGS assays, the original sample was crushed and pulverised at SGS Johannesburg 

and analysed at either SGS Johannesburg or SGS Perth.  The field duplicate samples were 

crushed and pulverised at Genalysis Johannesburg.  All primary field duplicate and umpire 

pulp samples were analysed at Genalysis Perth. 

The summary statistics for the duplicate analyses are shown in Table 14.2.2_1 and summary 

charts are presented in Appendix 1.  For the purposes of the precision analysis, a lower limit of 

10ppm U was applied to the data prior to analysis.

Umpire Field Duplicates 

The umpire laboratory field duplicates overall exhibit good precision.  The samples assayed at 

SGS Johannesburg show moderate to good precision with the Genalysis duplicates with 

85% of RC field (n=1,817) duplicates and 90% of the diamond duplicates (n=222) within a 

20% Rank HARD limit.  Both laboratories also reported similar means for each dataset 

(151ppm versus 147ppm U for the RC and 188ppm versus 188ppm U for the diamond 

duplicates). 

SGS Perth (n=272) exhibits a good precision when compared to Genalysis with 90% of the 

RC duplicates within a 20% Rank HARD limit.  However Genalysis reports a significantly 

higher mean (11%) of 160ppm U versus 143ppm U.  The bias is most pronounced for original 

samples having greater than 500ppm U. 

Umpire Pulp Duplicates 

The RC pulp duplicates for SGS Johannesburg (n=2,178) exhibit moderate precision, with 

75% of the data within a generally acceptable limit of 10% RANK HARD, a correlation 

coefficient of 0.99.  Comparative means between the two laboratories of 130ppm versus 

122ppm U indicate a 6% overall relative positive bias in the results from SGS Johannesburg. 

The diamond core pulp duplicates for SGS P (n=173) exhibit good precision, with 81% of the 

data within a generally acceptable limit of 10% RANK HARD and a correlation coefficient of 

0.99.  Comparative means between the two laboratories of 145ppm versus 138ppm indicate a 

5% overall positive bias in the results from SGS Johannesburg. 

The RC pulp duplicates for SGS Perth (n=149) exhibit moderate to good precision, with 75% of 

the data within a generally acceptable limit of 10% RANK HARD, a correlation coefficient of 0.98 

and comparative means between the two laboratories of 125ppm versus 133ppm U for SGS 

Johannesburg and Genalysis Perth respectively, indicating an 6% relative bias between the two 

laboratories.  The relative bias is most pronounced for samples above 200ppm U.

Internal Field Duplicates 

The RC field duplicate assayed at SGS Johannesburg (n=785) show moderate to high 

precision with 97% of the duplicates within a 20% Rank HARD limit.  Both campaigns also 

reported similar means for each dataset (107ppm versus 106ppm U). 

The diamond core field duplicate assayed at SGS Johannesburg (n=10) show low to moderate 

precision with 90% of the duplicates within a 20% Rank HARD limit and means of 86ppm 

versus 109ppm U.  The low number of samples in this dataset precludes meaningful 

extrapolation of the results. 

Laboratory Pulp Repeats (Replicates) 

The internal laboratory RC and diamond core pulp replicates for SGS Johannesburg and 

Perth exhibit a general high precision with between 85% and 99% of the data within a 10% 

Rank HARD limit.  The means for all of the pulp repeats are very similar. 

Inter-Laboratory and XRF versus ICPMS Comparisons 

The results from the inter-laboratory comparison conducted in September 2008 indicate that 

for all laboratories, relatively low to moderate precision (47% to 55% of the data within a 10% 

Rank HARD precision limit) is achieved when comparing the pulp samples. 

The results indicate that Setpoint and SGS report similar means (203ppm versus 202ppm U, 

n=488) and that both Setpoint and SGS report higher than ALS-Chemex (ALS): with the 

comparison of Setpoint versus ALS (n=920) reporting means of 230ppm U versus 197ppm U 

(a 16% relative global bias); and the comparison of SGS versus ALS (n=459) reporting means 

of 214ppm U versus 188ppm U (a 14% relative global bias). 

The comparison of XRF to ICPMS analysis conducted at SGS Perth indicates that for the 

406 samples analysed, the ICPMS method results in a slightly higher global mean for 184ppm 

versus 174ppm U (or 5.7%). 

Discussion 

Analyses of the Bannerman inserted standards indicate that the SGS Johannesburg 

laboratories are reporting a relative bias of between 3% and 8% higher than the expected 

values for these standards.  It is also noted that the SGS internal standards exhibit a bias of 

2% to 4% whereas Genalysis reports a negative bias of ~-2% for the same standards 

(UREM 2, 4 and 9). 

The duplicates data for SGS Johannesburg indicates that whilst the internal repeatability is 

good, there is a bias in the order of 3% to 6% compared with pulp duplicates sent to Genalysis 

in Perth.  This bias is not however seen with the field duplicates sent to Genalysis (particularly 

when outliers are removed).  It is interesting to note that the Inter-Laboratory comparison 

conducted in September 2008 shows that ALS and Setpoint in Johannesburg report similar 

means overall and both laboratories report 14% to 16% higher than ALS (Table 14.2.2_2).

43.101 Technical Document – 31 August 2009 

The trend of the bias seen at SGS Johannesburg is of minor concern; however this is 

tempered with the relatively good correlation seen with the field duplicates and the overall 

similar correlation seen between the SGS and Setpoint assays. 

The results of the pulp duplicates for SGS Perth indicate a general negative bias with respect 

to Genalysis in the order of 6% to 11%.  This potential bias should be tested with the insertion 

of industry standards to the SGS Perth laboratory for any future samples sent and further 

action taken as necessary. 

The following recommendations are made in relation to the QAQC protocols for the Etango 

Project: 

 Follow up investigations should be undertaken with SGS Johannesburg regarding the cause of the 
potential bias seen in the internal laboratory standards and Umpire assaying. 

 Standards AMIS85 and AMIS86 (and any other Bannerman standards) be regularly sent to 
Genalysis along with the regular Umpire duplicate samples.  

 Intra-Laboratory (i.e. same laboratory) blind pulp replicates should be undertaken at a nominal 
rate of 1:20. 

 A further high grade standard should be sourced to supplement AMIS0029. 

14.3 Independent Sampling 

Coffey Mining visited the Anomaly A/Oshiveli site during April 2008 and collected samples for 

the purposes of independent sampling (Figure 14.3_1).  A total of 40 RC samples from 

GARC0362 were placed into plastic bags with numbered security tags attached by the author 

directly after drilling and splitting in the field.  Once tagged, the bags were sent to 

Bannerman's sample storage yard for processing. 

Ten diamond samples were also collected from GOADH042.  These were collected from the 

core tray located at Bannerman's core shed, then placed in plastic bags with numbered 

security tags attached.  The tagged samples were then sent to the SGS Johannesburg 

laboratories where the security tags were inspected by Coffey Mining personnel, prior to 

sample preparation. 

The assay results from the samples are shown in Table 14.3_1.  The results illustrate typical 

examples of mineralisation from the property, with a maximum value of 1,392ppm U3O8 from 

sample A26295.  The average of the 40 RC samples collected from hole GARC0361 was 

235ppm U3O8.  The average of the 10 diamond samples collected was 13ppm U3O8.

14.4 Assessment of Project Database 

Based upon Coffey Mining's analysis of the duplicates data and the laboratory based 

standards data, the Bannerman assaying is considered to meet industry acceptable standards 

for sample accuracy and precision and is acceptable for use in resource estimation studies. 

From November 2007, Bannerman has used the Acquire commercial database software 

system to manage their drillhole data.  The use of such database management software is 

considered to be of high industry standard as it enables the incorporation of large datasets 

into an organised, auditable structure.  Checks by Coffey Mining have identified no material 

issues with the database and it is considered acceptable for use in resource estimations.

15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The Bannerman EPLs are situated within the highly prospective Central Zone of the Damara 

Orogenic Belt, which is currently subject to intensive exploration and development by a 

number of international mining and exploration companies.  Significant nearby uranium 

projects include the Rössing Mine, the Langer Heinrich Mine, and the nearby Husab project 

(Figure 4.4.1_1 in Section 4). 

15.1 Rössing Mine 

The Rössing Mine is controlled by Rössing Uranium Limited which in turn is owned by 

Rio Tinto (69%), the Government of Iran (15%), the Industrial Development Corporation of 

South Africa (10%), the Namibian Government (3%), and private ownership (3%).  The mine is 

located approximately 6.25km from the north-eastern boundary of EPL 3345 and is the largest 

granite-hosted uranium mine in the world.  Production commenced in 1976. 

Uranium mineralisation is associated with post-D3 Type D and E alaskites (Basson and 

Greenaway, 2004) which have preferentially intruded into pyroxene-hornblende gneiss and 

biotite-amphibole schist units of the Khan Formation in the northern ore zone, and into biotite-

amphibole schist/lower marble/lower biotite-cordierite gneiss of the Rössing Formation in the 

central ore zone (Roesener and Schreuder, 1997).  The main, primary uranium mineral is 

magmatic uraninite (Basson and Greenaway, 2004). 

The alaskites range in size from small quartzo-feldspathic lenses to large intrusive bodies, 

with the bulk of the economic mineralisation being contained in alaskite on the northern limb of 

the 'mine' synclinorium (Roesener and Schreuder, 1997). 

The stratigraphic trend which hosts the Rössing Mine is interpreted to extend into the centre of 

EPL 3345, highlighting the highly prospective nature of this tenement. 

15.2 Langer Heinrich Mine 

The Langer Heinrich uranium mine, which is owned by Paladin Resources Ltd, is located 

directly within the excised portion of EPL 3346 (Figure 4.4.1_1 of Section 4).  The mine came 

into production in December 2006. 

The Langer Heinrich deposit is a calcrete related uranium deposit that is associated with 

valley fill sediments in a Tertiary palaeodrainage system.  The uranium occurs as carnotite.  

The deposit occurs over a 15km strike length and has up to 8m of river sand and scree cover 

(Paladin, 2007b). 

Due to the proximity of such a large, proven calcrete-hosted system, this type of mineralisation 

will be prospective within Bannerman's EPL's.

15.3 Husab JV Project 

The Husab Joint Venture project is controlled by Extract Resources Ltd (Extract).  It consists 

of two EPL's with a total area of 637km² and is located directly between Bannerman's 
tenements (EPL 3345 and EPL 3346).  In July 2009, Extract publically reported a mineral 

resource upgrade for this project comprising an Indicated Resource of 21Mt at 527ppm U3O8 

and Inferred Resource of 126Mt at 436ppm U3O8 at Zone 1, and an Inferred Resource of 102Mt 

at 543ppm U3O8 at Zone 2, both above a 100ppm U3O8 lower cutoff, at its Rössing South 

prospect. 

The tenements contain primary alaskite hosted mineralisation (the main exploration focus) 

and secondary carnotite and calcrete hosted mineralisation.  Mineralised alaskites occur along 

the contact between the Khan Formation and marbles of the Husab Formation (Morel, 2007).

16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

No further work has been completed since the September 2008 Technical Report (Inwood, 2008) on 
mineral processing and metallurgical testing.  Various metallurgical methods are currently being 
trialled and tested, but this work all remains at a preliminary stage.  

Bannerman is undertaking an extensive and systematic metallurgical testwork programme.  Drilling is 
currently underway to obtain a 15-20 tonne bulk metallurgical sample of drill core, for further larger 
scale heap leach column testwork for use in confirming the design layout and costs of the modelled 
heap leach operation to a greater confidence level. 

Initial laboratory testwork has also been commenced on beneficiation through flotation methods and 
this has returned encouraging results.  Further beneficiation testwork is now continuing in an attempt to 
confirm the technical and commercial viability of these preliminary results. 

For information on the completed metallurgical work please refer to the technical report from August 
2008 (Inwood, N. A. 2008b, Etango Project, Namibia, Technical Report by Coffey Mining Pty Ltd for 
Bannerman Resources Limited).

17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

In July 2009, Coffey Mining completed resource estimate for the Anomaly A/Oshiveli uranium 

deposit and Onkelo uranium deposit.  The Anomaly A/Oshiveli uranium deposit has had 

resource estimates completed in 2008 and also in January 2009 and has again been updated.  

A maiden resource estimate was carried out for the Onkelo deposit.  

The Qualified Person responsible for the Anomaly A/Oshiveli resource estimate was Mr Neil 

Inwood, who is a Specialist Resource Geologist with the consultancy Coffey Mining Pty Ltd.  

The Qualified Persons responsible for the Onkelo resource estimate were Mr Neil Inwood and 

Mr Iain Macfarlane.  Mr Iain Macfarlane is a Senior Consultant Resources with the 

consultancy Coffey Mining Pty Ltd.  The Qualified Persons' certificates for Mr Inwood and 

Mr Iain Macfarlane are included in Appendix 3.  The details of the resource estimations are 

summarised later in this section. 

No formal Reserve estimate has been completed for the Anomaly A/Oshiveli or Onkelo 

deposit.  Bannerman is currently conducting a feasibility study for the project. 

17.1 Resource Database and Validation 

17.1.1 Database 

For the July 2009 resource update, only holes drilled by Bannerman were used. 

At Anomaly A/Oshiveli, the drillhole database in the vicinity of the estimation consists of 

628 RC and 72 diamond drillholes totalling 187,635m.  A total of 24 holes were drilled for non-

estimation purposes (eleven for metallurgical testing, nine for geotechnical testing and four for 

hydrogeological testwork).  The lithological contacts were considered whilst modelling for 

these holes which had not been assayed for testing purposes. 

The drillhole database for Onkelo consists of 57 RC holes for 11,913m.  

At Anomaly A/Oshiveli, the drillholes were oriented typically at 60º dip to the east (UTM grid) 
with a drill spacing ranging from 50m by 50m to 50m by 100m and 100m by 100m.  At Onkelo, 

the drillholes were drilled in three orientations to allow for the topography, these orientations 

typically being vertical, at 60º to the southeast (UTM grid) or at 60º to the northwest.  Many of 
the inclined holes were paired, sharing collar positions but drilled in directions 180º from each 
other.  This resulted in a nominal drill spacing of 50m along section, sections being 100m 

apart. 

A combination of chemical assaying (XRF and ICP- 39,843 samples or 96% of the total and 

3,821 data or 98% of the total) and factored radiometric data (1,599 and 92 1m composites) 

was used for the estimation of the mineralised zones at Anomaly A/Oshiveli and Onkelo 

Deposits respectively.

Where the chemical assays were returned below detection limit, half the detection limit was 

assigned to the intervals.  Intervals which were not sampled internal to mineralised zones 

were normally given a grade of 0.001ppm U3O8.  On a case by case basis, some intervals 

were treated as null (i.e. no samples) for drillholes which contained mineralised intervals and 

had not received any assaying results yet. 

17.1.2 Validation 

The 2009 drillhole database was checked by a variety of methods including: 

 Checks of the top 200 assays against original laboratory certificates. 

 Database and visual comparison of assay, collar and survey data against the 2008 validated 
database. 

 3D analysis of collar positions and downhole survey traces. 

No significant data related issues were identified and the resulting database was considered 

to be robust and appropriate for use in resource estimation. 

17.2 Geological Interpretation and Modelling 

17.2.1 Geological and Mineralisation Model 

Separate three dimensional (3D) models were created for both the alaskite bodies and the 

mineralised zones.  The majority of the uranium mineralisation is associated with the alaskite 

bodies and follows the trends of the alaskite contacts, with typically little significant 

mineralisation occurring in the surrounding sediments.  The alaskite contacts were therefore 

considered at the time of modelling and used to guide 3D modelling of the mineralisation 

shapes. 

To establish appropriate grade continuity, the mineralisation model for the Anomaly A/Oshiveli 

deposit was based upon a nominal 75ppm U3O8 mineralisation halo.  This nominal 

mineralisation outline typically also represented the natural cutoff of U3O8 mineralisation 

exhibited in the drillholes, with grades typically falling below 30ppm to 20ppm U3O8 away from 

the logged alaskite contacts. 

The mineralisation boundaries within the alaskites bodies were often extended to the alaskite 

contacts for up to 3m, even if these intervals were not mineralised above the nominal 

75ppm U3O8 cutoff. 

The mineralisation constraints were generated based upon sectional interpretation and three 

dimensional analyses of the available drilling data.  At Anomaly A/Oshiveli, the mineralised 

zones (Figure 17.2.1_1) were modelled as 56 distinct zones (3m to 168m thick) with a 

northerly trend.  The zones dip from -30° to -40° to the west.  Individual zones were modelled 

from 150m to 1,400m long.  At Onkelo, the mineralised zones (Figure 17.2.1_2) were 

modelled as ten distinct zones (3m to 35m thick) with a north easterly trend.  The zones dip at 

about -25° to the northwest.  Individual zones modelled were from 300m to 1,100m long.

zones, alaskite interpretation and the contact zone between the Chuos, Khan and Etusis 

meta-sediments.  Figure 17.2.1_4 displays the equivalent at Onkelo (without the 

metasediment contact zones which were absent).  Individual mineralised zones which did not 

have more than two drillhole intersections on two consecutive 50m or 100m spaced sections 

were typically not estimated.

17.2.2 Weathering Profile 

The pedolith mainly consists of <1m of transported sands.  In places minor calcrete or 

gypcrete is encountered within the transported sand and where present it often binds the sand 

grains together to form a surface cap.  At Anomaly A/Oshiveli, the base of the weathering 

profile in the alaskites and surrounding meta-sediments was logged to extend typically less 

than 50m from the surface.  At Onkelo, the base of weathering where recorded was typically at 

3m or less.  Consequently, the weathering profile was modelled for the resource estimate at 

Anomaly A/Oshiveli only.  A brief analysis was conducted to determine the effect of density 

and U3O8 grades within the profile. 

Some leaching of uranium from the alaskites near surface was evident.  This is thought to be 

associated with oxidation observed in the upper parts of the deposit.  Based upon the 

available core density measurements, the effect of weathering on density within the profile is 

considered to be negligible. 

17.3 Statistical Analysis 

For the Anomaly A/Oshiveli estimate, the vast bulk of the assays (96%) used in the resource 

estimates were analysed by XRF, with the remainder being predominantly factored gamma 

log eU3O8 analysis sourced from the Auslog tool. 

In 2008, a comparative analysis was conducted between the radiometric and XRF data to 

determine the robustness of the radiometric datasets for Anomaly A (Inwood, 2008).  The 

analysis indicated that the radiometric datasets were positively biased with respect to the XRF 

assaying.  As the radiometric data constituted such a small portion of the resource dataset, the 

factors obtained from the 2008 study were applied to the radiometric data for 2009 for

Anomaly A/Oshiveli.  Factoring of the radiometric datasets for Onkelo is discussed in 

Section 17.3.1. 

The linear regressions used for the factoring of the Auslog eU3O8 data to minimise any relative 

bias are shown below: 

 Bin 1 – 0ppm to 1,100ppm eU3O8 

 Factored Auslog = Auslog eU3O8ppm * 0.86 -  26 

 Bin 2  - 1,100ppm to 1,700ppm eU3O8 

 Factored Auslog = Auslog eU3O8ppm * 1.03 -  67 

 Bin 3  - > 1,700ppm 

 Factored Auslog = Auslog eU3O8ppm * 0.96 + 79 

17.3.1 Onkelo Radiometric Data and Factoring 

At Onkelo, statistical analysis was undertaken for 9,070 matching pairs of chemical (XRF) 

U3O8 1m data and the Auslog eU3O8 1m composite data.  Figure 17.3.1_1 presents summary 

statistics and charts for the Auslog and XRF data pairs. 

Scatter plots of both datasets indicate a broad scatter with correlation coefficients of 0.6.   

Q-Q plots for both datasets illustrate that the bias is most pronounced for the grade population 

above 1,600ppm U3O8.  For the grade population above 1,600ppm U3O8, the Auslog grades 

are generally higher than those of the chemical data. 

Analysis of the matching data pairs indicated that the Auslog radiometric data exhibited a 

positive bias relative to the XRF data.  From the raw statistics, the Auslog had a higher mean 

(125ppm eU3O8 versus 101ppm U3O8) although a lower standard deviation (174 versus 188) 

compared to the XRF data.  

The linear regression used for the factoring of the Auslog eU3O8 data is shown below: 

 y = 1.06x -31.62 

The results of the factoring of the radiometric datasets can be seen in Figure 17.3.1_2. 

After factoring, the Auslog data had a mean of 107ppm eU3O8 versus a mean grade of 

101ppm U3O8 for the XRF data with matching data pairs.  The standard deviations of the two 

datasets were similar (188 for the XRF data versus 181 for the factored Auslog data).  The  

Q-Q plot on Figure 17.3.1_2 indicates a good correlation between the data populations up to 

about 1,000ppm U3O8 and then a relative negative effect is introduced into the Auslog data 

population.  The maximum factored value used in the resource estimation was 722ppm U3O8. 

The results of the factoring of the radiometric datasets were inspected visually against the 

XRF data using Vulcan mining software over the mineralised zones of interest.  The results of 

the radiometric factoring were considered appropriate for use in resource estimations.

17.3.2 Statistical Analysis of Composites and Top Cuts 

The bulk of the sampled intervals were 1m in length.  To emulate any potential mining sub-

bench size (i.e. 2.5m) it was decided to use 3m U3O8 composites at Anomaly A/Oshiveli, for 

the estimation with a minimum allowable length of 1.2m.  Any residuals (composites <1.2m) 

were not used in the estimates.  Further statistical investigations were performed upon the 

3m U3O8 composites from within each of the mineralised zones. 

At Onkelo, 2m U3O8 composites were used for the estimation with a minimum allowable length 

of 1.0m.  Any residuals (composites <1.0m) were not used in the estimates.  Further statistical 

investigations were performed upon the 2m U3O8 composites from within each of the 

mineralised zones. 

Summary statistics of the U3O8 composites are presented in Tables 17.3.2_1 and 17.3.2_2 for 

Anomaly A/Oshiveli and Onkelo respectively. 

Full statistical plots from all of the mineralised zones are shown in Appendix 2. 

Figures 17.3.2_1 and 17.3.2_2 show typical histogram and log-probability plots of the 

3m U3O8 composite data from within Zones 2 and 14 respectively at Anomaly A.  Both plots 

demonstrate the strong positive tail typical of the deposit; however both datasets also have a 

relatively low coefficient of variations (standard deviation/mean) of  0.76 for Zone 2 and 1.04 

for Zone 14, indicating that positive outliers do not necessarily heavily impact upon the mean 

of the data population  

Figures 17.3.2_3 and 17.3.2_4 show typical histogram and log-probability plots of the 2m U3O8 

composite data from within Zones 10 and 40 at Onkelo.  Both plots demonstrate the strong 

positive tail typical of the deposit; however both datasets also have a relatively low coefficient of 

variations (standard deviation/mean 0.63 for Zone 10 and 0.84 for Zone 40) indicating that 

positive outliers do not necessarily heavily impact upon the mean of the data population. 

Assessment of the high grade U3O8 composites was completed to determine the requirement 

for high-grade cutting to be used for resource estimation.  The approach taken included: 

 Detailed review of histogram and probability plots, with significant breaks in populations used to 
interpret possible outliers; 

 Detailed review of spatial distribution plots; and 

 Ranking of the composite data and the investigation of the influence of individual composites on 
the mean and standard deviation. 

The top cuts used and their effect on the mean of the mineralised zones average grade are 

shown in Tables 17.3.2_1 and 17.3.2_2 for Anomaly A/Oshiveli and Onkelo respectively.  The 

effect of applying top cuts to the bulk of the zones was to reduce the naïve mean by between 1 

to 7%.  However some zones were highly sensitive to the cutting of a relatively few high grade 

samples (e.g. Zone 35, where the cutting of 5 samples resulted in a 15% decrease in the 

mean) due to extreme high-grade outliers.

17.3.4 Variography 

As the 2009 resource update for Anomaly A/Oshiveli predominantly consisted of infill drilling, 

the variography used for the 2009 resource update was predominantly based upon on the 

analysis conducted for the 2008 resource, which is described below.  The additional zones in 

the north of the deposit (Zones 51-56) were checked separately and were ultimately based 

upon the variography derived from Zone 2. 

In this document, the term 'variogram' is used as a generic word to designate the function 

characterising the variability of variables versus the distance between two samples.  The Isatis 

geostatistical software was used to analyse the Anomaly A/Oshiveli variography.  Both 

traditional semi-variograms and correlograms were used to analyse the spatial variability of 

the U3O8 3m composites for four of the major mineralised zones.  Downhole variography was 

calculated and used to determine the nugget for each of the zones. 

Table 17.3.4_1 summarises the resulting variogram models used in the resource estimate for 

Anomaly A/Oshiveli.  All zones exhibited a well structured downhole variogram with a relative 

nugget between 27% and 43% and a total range of between 18m and 30m.  The variography 

in the major and semi-major axis were generally poorly defined having a spherical structure 

with a relative sill of between 35% and 50% at ranges of between 35 to 50m in the major axis.  

This has typically resulted in most of the zones having 68% to 75% of the total variance 

modelled within the range of the first structure.  The total range of the major axis varies from 

90m to 150m. 

Figure 17.3.4_1 shows an example of the obtained variography from Zone 3.  Summary plots 

of the variography for the main zones are included in Appendix 2. 

After investigation of the variography of the remaining zones, it was decided to base the 

variogram parameters of these zones upon those of either Zones 2, 3, 13, 14, 18 or 23 

(see Table 17.3.4_1) based upon similarities in grade and geometry.  The variogram 

orientations for these zones were changed as required to follow the orientation trend of the 

zones, as indicated in Table 17.5.1_1. 

Table 17.3.4_2 summarises the resulting variogram model used in the resource estimate for 

Onkelo.  By zone, the variography in all axes was poorly defined.  Consequently, samples 

from all zones were combined for modelling.  The nugget was obtained from modelling the 

downhole variogram which had a relative nugget of 30% and a total range of 30m.  The 

resultant directional model (Figure 17.3.4_2) had a spherical structure with a relative sill of 

30% having a range of 80m in the major axis.  This has typically resulted in 73% of the total 

variance modelled within the range of the first structure.  The total range of the major axis was 

230m.  This model was subsequently used for all zones in the estimation process.

17.4 Block Model Construction 

For Anomaly A/Oshiveli, a block model was created using Surpac mining software with a 

parent cell size of 25m (Easting) by 25m (Northing) by 10m (RL) which was sub-blocked down 

to 12.5m (Easting) by 12.5m (Northing) by 1.25m (RL).  No rotation was applied to the block 

model.  The block model parameters are summarised below in Table 17.4_1.  The variables 

coded into the block model are presented in Table 17.4_2.

For Onkelo, a block model was created using Vulcan mining software with a parent cell size of 

50m (X) by 30m (Y) by 10m (RL) which was sub-blocked down to 5m (X) by 5m (Y) by 

2.5m (RL).  A rotation of 45º from north was applied to the block model.  The block model 
parameters are summarised below in Table 17.4_3.  The variables coded into the block model 

are shown below in Table 17.4_4.

17.5 Grade Estimation 

17.5.1 OK Estimate 

Grade was estimated into the block models using Ordinary Block Kriging (OK) for U3O8 related 

variables.  At Anomaly A/Oshiveli, no mathematical change of support was applied to emulate 

selective mining scenarios as it was considered that the parent cell block size of 25m by 25m 

by 10m would be similar in size to likely selective mining blocks for a bulk-mining scenario.  

Coffey Mining recommends that emulation of potential smaller selective mining units be 

considered for future estimates. 

Sample neighbourhood testing was conducted using Isatis geostatistical software to 

determine an appropriate search strategy for the OK estimation.  The neighbourhood testing 

included investigations into the minimum and maximum number of samples used for 

estimation, block discrimination, negative kriging weights, the slope of regression and the 

resulting kriging variance. 

As the Bannerman drilling had been completed on a regular grid pattern, drillhole data 

clustering was not significant and the same sample selection criteria were used for all 

mineralised zones.  The resulting staged sample search strategy is summarised in 

Table 17.5.1_1 for Anomaly A/Oshiveli, the sample search was orientated the same as for the 

variogram orientations in Table 17.3.4_1.

The sample selection criteria for Onkelo are presented in Table 17.5.1_2.  The variogram 

parameters used for the estimation were based upon the variography discussed in 

Section 17.3.4 and summarised in Table 17.3.4_2.  Domain control was used for the OK 

estimate using whole block discretisation of 5 points in the x-dimension, 5 points in the y-

direction and 3 points in the z-dimension for a total of 75 points for Anomaly A/Oshiveli and 6 

points in the x-dimension, 4 points in the y-direction and 2 points in the z-dimension for a total 

of 48 points for Onkelo per whole block estimate.  Any sub-blocks within the 3D limit of each 

whole block were assigned the whole block OK estimate.

17.5.2 Validation 

A detailed visual and statistical review of the OK estimate was conducted including: 

 For Anomaly A/Oshiveli, a comparison of the block model whole block estimate versus the mean 
of the composited dataset, including weighting where appropriate to account for data clustering 
(see Table 17.5.2_1); and 

 Visual and graphical comparison of the input composites data with the block grade estimates in 
various cross section views and in plan.  Figure 17.5.2_1 and 17.5.2_2 show examples of the 
validation plots from Anomaly A/Oshiveli and Onkelo respectively. 

Zones which exhibited large grade differences to the input composites were checked in 3D 

(e.g. Zone 35) for potential errors, these differences typically being found to result from the 

proportional effect of a low number of composites in smaller zones of irregular geometries. 

Overall, the grade estimates showed a good reproduction of the composite datasets with 

internal grade zonation within larger blocks being appropriately delineated.

17.6 Density 

The density values used for the resource model were based upon the data analysed in 

Section 17.3.3.  A value of 2.63t/m³ was used for all material within the modelled alaskite 
bodies.  The same value was coded into all modelled mineralised zones. 

Densities of 2.69t/m³, 2.76t/m³ and 2.77t/m³ were coded for the Chuos, Khan and Etusis 
lithologies respectively. 

Based upon the available core density measurements, the effect of weathering on the density 

of the profile is considered to be minor and no change was applied to the density of the 

different lithologies based upon the weathering profile.

17.7 Resource Reporting and Classification 

17.7.1 Introduction 

The resource estimate for the Anomaly A/Oshiveli and Onkelo uranium deposits have been 

categorised in accordance with the criteria laid out in the Canadian National Instrument  

43-101 ("CNI43") and the JORC Code.  For Anomaly A/Oshiveli, a combination of Measured, 

Indicated and Inferred Resources have been defined using definitive criteria determined 

during the validation of the grade estimates, with detailed consideration of the CNI43 

categorisation guidelines.  For Onkelo, an Inferred Resource only has been defined. 

17.7.2 Criteria for Resource Categorisation 

The resource has been classified as a combination of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral 

Resources based on the confidence level of the key criteria that were considered during 

resource classification as presented in Table 17.7.2_1.  Figures 17.7.2_1 and 17.7.2_2 illustrate 

the classification applied to the Anomaly A/Oshiveli and Onkelo resources respectively.

Measured Resources 

A Measured category was assigned based on blocks estimated in pass one or two of the 

estimate, for mineralised zones with a strong geological understanding, consistent 

mineralisation shape, and a nominal 25m by 25m drillhole coverage. 

Indicated Resources 

An Indicated category was assigned based on blocks estimated in pass one or two of the 

estimate, for mineralised zones with a strong geological understanding, consistent 

mineralisation shape, and a nominal 50m by 50m to 50m by 100m drillhole coverage. 

Inferred Resources 

An Inferred category was applied to all mineralisation zones (apart from Zone 44) which were 

not classified as Indicated. 

17.7.3 Grade Tonnage Reporting 

The reported resources for the Anomaly A/Oshiveli and Onkelo deposits reported above 

various cutoffs are summarised in Tables 17.7.3_1 and 17.7.3_2 respectively. 

Coffey Mining is unaware of any mining, metallurgical, infrastructure or other relevant factors 

which may materially affect the resources.  The availability of suitable water and power 

supplies may be key factors in any future mining studies. 

Bannerman had previously estimated a resource for the Anomaly A deposit in January 2008, 

August 2008 and February 2009 based upon a combination of chemical assaying and factored 

radiometric data.  The previous, now superseded, resources are tabulated below 

(Tables 17.7.3_3 to 17.7.3.5) for reference.

17.8 Comments and Recommendations 

The July 2009 resource update for the Anomaly A/Oshiveli deposit and the new resource for 

Onkelo have resulted in an incremental increase in the resource endowment when compared 

to the January 2009 estimate.  The 50m by 50m infill drilling at Anomaly A/Oshiveli has both 

firmed up the geological control of many of the mineralised zones and demonstrated that the 

continuity of uranium mineralisation which can be variable throughout the alaskites. 

Coffey Mining has the following recommendations for the ongoing resource estimation studies: 

 The sample collection and assaying schemes used by Bannerman are considered industry 
acceptable practice and should be maintained and monitored. 

 Though not analysed in detail, the initial results of the comparison of the RC and Diamond twin 
drilling programmes indicate that no bias between the two drilling methods is present.  The close 
spaced twin drilling does indicate that, in some instances, alaskite contacts and mineralisation can 
be highly variable over short distances. 

 Based upon the density data available there is no significant difference between the densities of 
the weathered and unweathered alaskite and meta-sedimentary lithologies.

18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

18.1 PFS Study 

Bannerman announced, on 27 July 2009, that the preliminary feasibility study (PFS) on the 

Etango Uranium Project had been extended to enable consideration of the impact of additional 

metallurgical and processing testwork and an increase in the mineral resource estimate.  No 

further work has been completed, although these works remain in progress.  Please refer to 

the previous technical report from August 2008 (Inwood) for associated text. 

18.1.1 Mining 

The PFS has at this stage has identified a conventional open pit mining operation as the preferred 

option, although no further work has been completed on this section.  Please refer to the previous 

technical report from August 2008 (Inwood) for associated text. 

18.1.2 Geotechnical and Hydrogeology Input 

Nine geotechnical holes have been drilled and logged as at mid March 2009.  Samples are 

sent to Rocklab in South Africa for Direct Shear, Uniaxial Compressive Strength, Elastic 

Modulus & Poisson's Ratio Stress (UCM) and Triaxial Compressive Strength, Elastic Modulus 

& Poisson's Ratio Stress (TCM) tests.  Testwork results for the last four holes are pending. 

Eight hydrological holes were drilled around the proposed pit, plant and TSF areas.  Holes 

were drilled vertically to a depth of 100m.  Water samples were analysed for major anions and 

cations, pH, acidity, alkalinity, total salts and electric conductivity.  Further tests will be 

completed during the March 2009 quarter.  

18.1.3 Operating Costs 

No further work has been completed in this section.  Please refer to the previous technical 

report from August 2008 (Inwood) for associated text. 

18.2 Mineral Processing 

A Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS) is under preparation and Bannerman has engaged 

Coffey Mining and GRD Minproc, two specialist Australian consultancies to prepare the Study 

volumes with input from Bannerman and other consultancies as appropriate.  This PFS 

involves additional metallurgical testwork.  It is expected that the PFS will be lodged at the end 

of 2009.  Subject to this PFS reaching required technical and economic hurdles, a Definitive 

Feasibility Study (DFS) would then be undertaken in 2010.  

Please refer to the previous technical report from August 2008 (Inwood) for associated text.

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

19.1 Geology and Resources 

The region of EPL 3345 currently represents the most significant asset for Bannerman due to 

the advanced nature of exploration and the identified Measured, Indicated and Inferred 

Mineral Resources at Anomaly A, Oshiveli and Onkelo.  Bannerman's other assets include 

projects in the region of EPL 3346 and in Botswana, although these are not currently 

considered to be material assets of the Company. 

The Etango Project hosts a significant uranium resource and represents an advanced 

exploration project which is now undergoing feasibility studies.  The western flank of the 

Palmenhorst Dome represents a prospective strike length of over 15km which incorporates 

the Anomaly A, Oshiveli and Onkelo deposits.  The eastern flank of the Palmenhorst Dome is 

also highly prospective, as are other soil and sand covered areas in the south portion of EPL 

3345, in the vicinity of Anomaly A. 

EPL 3345 is located within the highly prospective Central Zone of the Damara Orogenic Belt.  

Currently 12 historic uranium anomalies have been identified over the EPL 3345 area, some 

of which correspond to radiometric anomalies associated with the Rössingberg Dome and the 

Palmenhorst Dome.  EPL 3346 is considered prospective for primary and calcrete hosted 

uranium mineralisation, although most of the current work is focussed upon the Etango 

Uranium Project within EPL 3345. 

Coffey Mining has reviewed the drilling, sampling and assaying procedures used by 

Bannerman and finds them to be acceptable by industry standards.  Follow up investigations 

should be undertaken with SGS Johannesburg regarding the cause of the potential bias seen 

in the internal laboratory standards and Umpire assaying. 

19.2 Mining 

Preliminary mining studies based upon the current resource indicate that there is potential for 

a 15Mtpa conventional open pit mining operation that could be economically viable. 

19.3 Metallurgical 

Additional metallurgical testwork has been completed on drill core samples to further define 

the comminution, leaching and other characteristics of the Anomaly A deposit alaskite 

mineralisation.  To date, the testing indicates ore properties suitable for standard comminution 

and acid leach metal recovery.  Chemical analysis indicates that the supplied composite 

sample is characterised by low levels of impurity elements. 

Further metallurgical testwork is proposed and underway to provide detailed ore performance 

parameters for ongoing process and general engineering studies.

19.4 Geotechnical and Hydrology 

The establishment of geotechnical parameters for both the mine and plant site areas that was 

recommended in the previous report is underway.  Similarly, the recommendations regarding 

the hydrological drilling to establish the groundwater conditions of the Anomaly A, Oshiveli 

and Onkelo area are being carried out. 

19.5 Project Development 

Bannerman is continuing with the PFS activities currently underway at Coffey Mining, 

GRD Minproc and others to establish the economic potential of the Etango Project.  Related 

activities include environmental assessment and permitting, human resourcing and economic 

modelling.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Bannerman has commissioned both PFS and BFS level reports to demonstrate the economic 

potential of the Etango Project.  The studies are multi-discipline and interdependent and 

include the following activities: 

20.1 Resource Definition 

Bannerman is continuing its exploration efforts on defining the full extents of the mineralisation 

around the Anomaly A, Oshiveli and Onkelo deposits.  Several drilling rigs are currently in 

operation in the project area and these are engaged in resource definition, infill, metallurgical 

bulk sample and geotechnical drilling programmes.  The current QAQC regime should be 

expanded to ensure that Bannerman supplied standards are sent to the SGS Perth 

laboratories.  Also, in addition to a standard 1:20 Umpire analysis ratio, it is recommended that 

a suite of pulp duplicates be analysed by the umpire laboratory in Perth to supplement the QA 

process of the SGS Johannesburg laboratory. 

20.2 Mining Studies 

Pending the outcomes of the resource upgrade activities described above, further pit 

optimisation and design activities are planned.  The culmination of this work will be the 

development of the final feasibility study mine plan and associated capital and operating cost 

estimates. 

20.3 Geotechnical and Hydrology 

The establishment of geotechnical parameters for both the mine and plant site areas has 

commenced as part of the PFS and, similarly, work has also commenced on establishing the 

groundwater conditions of the project area via a definitive hydrological study. 

20.4 Metallurgical Testwork 

The additional metallurgical testwork described in Section 19.3 is underway in order to provide 

improved confidence in the ore characteristics determined to date and to provide information 

required for continued process and general engineering development. 

20.5 Project Development 

On the basis of the information presented in this report, it is recommended that Bannerman 

continue with the PFS activities currently underway by GRD Minproc and others to establish 

the economic potential of the Etango Uranium Project.  Related activities include 

environmental assessment and permitting, human resourcing and economic modelling. 

The estimated budget to achieve the above recommendations is summarised in Table 20_1 

below.
