SUMMARY 

 
 
    JNR Resources Inc. ("JNC") is earning a 100% interest, subject to a 2.0% net smelter return 
(NSR) royalty in the Triple 9 property, a Kuroko styled massive sulphide project, by paying 
$1,035,000 and issuing 2,050,000 shares over the next three years. The road accessible Triple 9 
property lies 6 kilometres northwest of Sicamous, British Columbia and consists of 2 claims 
totaling 717.22 hectares. 
 
     The Triple 9 property is underlain by the Hadrynian? to Paleozoic Eagle Bay Assemblage, a 
belt of meta sedimentary to meta volcanics rocks lying in south central British Columbia. This 
assemblage, a target for massive sulphide deposits, stretches from Barriere to Sicamous.   
 
       In May 2019, JNC undertook a grid and roadside soil sampling program, a stream sediment 
sampling and a rock sampling program to investigate the mineral bearing potential of the Triple 
9 property. The soil program identified an elongate 2200 metre, northeasterly trending 
coincidental Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn anomaly beginning near the Bluenose showing and extending to 
the property boundary. The rock sampling program identified mineralization at the upper 
Bluenose showing area and the Road Zone.  The upper Bluenose area returned anomalous rock 
samples with a highlight select grab sample from the dump grading 14.8 grams per tonne silver 
and 1.6% copper (TRC-49).  The second area returning anomalous values is termed the Road 
zone and is an area extending some 200 meters.  Channel sampled returned weighted average 
results of 10.2 g/t silver and 0.14% copper over 1.40 meters (samples Y003385-87) and 4.31 g/t  
silver and 0.23% copper over 2.30 meters (sample Y002297). Selected grab samples from this 
area returned 83.2 g/t silver, 1.23% copper 0.97% lead and 0.79% zinc (sample TRC-58) and 62.3 
g/t silver, 0.929% copper, 0.413% lead and 0.265% zinc (sample TRC-59). In addition, several 
float samples returned interesting values with sample TRC-40 returning 1.96 g/t silver, 0.215% 
copper 0.01 % lead and 1.585% zinc and sample 851 returning 35.2 grams per tonne silver, 
1.235% copper, 0.633% lead and 6.37% zinc.  The rock sampling program outlined 
mineralization occurring as massive sulfide pods and lenses with associated quartz veins and 
breccias in both the meta-volcanics and in the orthogniess. 
 
    The 2019 soil sampling program successfully identified a broad geochemical anomaly with 
coincidental anomalous rock geochemistry.  A 3 dimensional induced polarization survey is 
recommended to aid in identifying and outlining conductive zones occurring within the 
geochemical trend.  In conjunction to the IP survey the company should conduct backhoe 
trenching of coincidental geophysical and geochemical anomalies.  The cost of this program is 
estimated at $125,000.

     There are no environmental liabilities associated with the Triple 9 property to the best of the 
author's knowledge. The next phases of exploration on the property will be induced 
polarization trenching and drilling, which require a permit through the British Columbia 
Ministry of Energy and Mines Notice of Work application process. The Ministry is quoting a 90 
day period to complete the permitting process. The company plans to submit the Notice of 
Work Permit Application shortly. 
 
     The author is not aware of any other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, 
or the right or ability to perform work on the Triple 9 property. 
 

 
ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
 

     The Triple 9  property lies 6 kilometres north of Sicamous, British Columbia. Access is by a 
network of logging roads taken northward for 11 kilometres to the southeastern border of 
Tenure 1052831.  
 
     The topography is steep, with elevations on the property ranging from 356 metres ASL on 
Shuswap lake along the western boundary of the property to 1375 metres ASL on the 
southeastern boundary. The claims are generally covered with dense stands of cedar, balsam, 
spruce and fir with occasional clear cuts from logging.  The underbrush is thin except within 
creek drainages and along north slopes where blow down can be severe. Gravel roads provide 
fairly reasonable access to the ground on the claim block. 
 
     The climate of this part of the province is typical of the southern interior of British Columbia. 
The summer field season is generally warm and dry and runs from mid- to late- April through 
to late-October. Winters are cold with significant snow accumulations. Temperatures can dip to 
minus 20 Celsius for extended periods. 

 
     As this is a greenfields exploration project, detailed surveys with respect to potential tailings 
storage areas, waste disposal areas, heap leach pad areas or potential processing plant areas 
have not been undertaken. The claims are on crown land, so the surface rights are held by the 
crown. Power lines run down Highway 1 thus power is within 11 kilometres of the property. 
Water is available from the numerous creeks throughout the claim block. Mining personnel, 
accommodation, heavy equipment, supplies and fuel are readily available locally in Sicamous, 
Revelstoke or Kamloops.   
 

HISTORY 
 

      The first recorded work on the Triple 9  property is reported in the BC Department of Mines 
("BCDM") Annual Report of 1900 which reported assays averaging 1.48 oz per ton gold ($29.62 
per ton Au  converted at $20 per ounce Au) with values as high as 34.90 oz  per ton gold($698 
per ton Au converted at $20 per ounce Au) in a vein 50 feet (15.2 metres) wide and not less than 
300 feet (91.4 metres) in length.  In 1901 and 1902 the BCDM Annual Reports document work 
performed on the Iron Mask Claims which covered the Bluenose south showing referring  to 
numerous  pits and trenches along with 700 feet (213.4 metres) of adit being built.

No work was recorded on the property until 1968 when Royal Canadian Ventures performed 8 
kilometres of ground magnetometer and EM-16 VLF geophysics on ground that is now covered 
by tenure 1052831.   In 1969, Tranquility explorations completed 14.5 line kilometers of 
magnetometer geophysics over ground now covered by the tenures 1052831 and 1052827. 
 
The present property vendors acquired the Triple 9 property through map staking in 2014. They 
commissioned a 2016 structural interpretation report authored by L. Sookochof P.Geo. This 
report identified preferred structural orientations on the property.  In 2017 a prospecting report 
was filed by Chris Delorme covering the tenures. A total of 17 grab rock samples were taken, 12 
around the upper Bluenose showing and 5 elsewhere on the property. Analysis was completed 
for gold only; the best sample ran 1.07 g/t Au.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

(Summarized from Schiarizza and Preto, 1987) 
Regional Geology 
 
     The Triple 9 project lies within the Kootnay terrane at the south end of the Omineca Belt in 
the central interior of British Columbia. The Kootnay terrane is a belt of lower to mid-Proterzoic 
rocks that lie approximately along the suture between North America and the Intermontane 
superterrane. (Figure 3). 
 
    The map area covers a belt of structurally complex low grade metamorphic rocks lying along 
the western margin of the Omineca Belt. These rocks are flanked by high-grade metamorphic 
rocks of the Shuswap Complex to the east and by rocks of the 1ntemontane Belt to the west. The 
area is underlain mainly by Paleozoic meta-sedimentary and meta-volcanic rocks of the Eagle 
Bay Assemblage and Fenneli Formation. Late Devonian granitic orthogneiss locally intrudes 
Eagle Bay rocks.  The Paleozoic rocks are cut by mid-Cretaceous granodiorite and quartz 
monzonite of the Raft and Baldy batholiths, and by Early Tertiary quartz feldspar porphyry, 
basalt and lamprophyre dykes. They are locally overlain by Eocene sedimentary and volcanic 
rocks of the Kamloops Group and by Miocene plateau laws.  
 
     The Paleozoic rocks occur in four structural slices separated by southwesterly directed thrust 
faults. The upper three fault slices contain only Eagle Bay rocks, while the lowest slice 
comprises Eagle Bay strata structurally overlain by the Fennell Formation. 
 

 
Property Geology 
     The Triple J property has not yet been mapped. According to the BC government mapping, 
the property is underlain by rocks of the Hadrynian? to Paleozoic Eagle Bay assemblage. These 
comprise quartzite, marble, hornblende-rich skarn and pink to grey paragneiss. In general, 
bedding or gneissosity dips at low angles to the east. The rocks are highly deformed and minor 
tight folds are very abundant.  
 
     The upper Bluenose zone lies on a relatively flat shelf above a series of high cliffs. The rock 
exposed along the cliffs is largely gently dipping paragneiss with sections of limy skarn and 
marble.  
 
 
Mineralization 
    The upper Bluenose showing consists of a shaft, partly collapsed and filled with water. 
Material on the dump is heavily mineralized with pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite, mostly in a 
quartz breccia. An adit, 91 metres in length, is about 61 metres vertically below the shaft and 
cuts paragneiss and marble dipping about 10 degrees east. Very minor pyrite and pyrrhotite are 
present in several patches. A second adit at the same elevation as the shaft and about 61 metres 
south, cuts entirely barren gneiss for 15 metres. A pit, about 91 metres south of the shaft, 
exposes light colored quartz-rich marble with abundant malachite and minor chalcopyrite. 

 
     The 2019 soil program successfully highlighted a 2200 metre, northeasterly trending 
coincidental Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn anomaly beginning near the Bluenose showing and extending to 
the property boundary.

GEOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS CAPSULE DESCRIPTION: One or more lenses of massive 
pyrite, sphalerite, galena, and chalcopyrite commonly within felsic volcanic rocks in a calcalkaline 
bimodal arc succession. The lenses may be zoned, with a Cu-rich base and a Pb-Zn-rich top; low-grade 
stockwork zones commonly underlie lenses and barite or chert layers may overlie them.  
 
TECTONIC SETTING: Island arc; typically in a local extensional setting or rift environment within, or 
perhaps behind, an oceanic or continental margin arc. 
 
DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT / GEOLOGICAL SETTING: Marine volcanism; commonly 
during a period of more felsic volcanism in an andesite (or basalt) dominated succession; locally 
associated with fine-grained marine sediments; also associated with faults or prominent fractures.  
 
AGE OF MINERALIZATION: Any age; In British Columbia typically Devonian; less commonly 
Permian-Mississippian, Late Triassic, Early (and Middle) Jurassic, and Cretaceous. 
 
HOST / ASSOCIATED ROCK TYPES: Submarine volcanic arc rocks; rhyolite, dacite associated with 
andesite or basalt; less commonly, in mafic alkaline arc successions; associated epiclastic deposits and 
minor shale or sandstone; commonly in close proximity to felsic intrusive rocks. Ore horizon grades 
laterally and vertically into thin chert or sediment layers called informally "exhalites". 
 
DEPOSIT FORM: Concordant massive to banded sulphide lens which is typically metres to tens of 
metres thick and tens to hundreds of metres in horizontal dimension; sometimes there is a peripheral 
apron of "clastic" massive sulphides; underlying crosscutting "stringer" zone of intense alteration and 
stockwork veining. 

 
TEXTURE / STRUCTURE: Massive too well layered sulphides, typically zoned vertically and laterally; 
sulphides with quartz, chert or barite gangue (more common near the top of the deposit); disseminated, 
stockwork and vein sulphides (footwall).

GANGUE MINERALOGY: Barite, chert, gypsum, anhydrite and carbonate near top of lens, carbonate, 
quartz, chlorite and sericite near the base. 
 
ALTERATION MINERALOGY: Footwall alteration pipes are commonly zoned from the core with 
quartz, sericite or chlorite to an outer zone of clay minerals, albite and carbonate (siderite or ankerite). 
 
ORE CONTROLS: More felsic component of mafic to intermediate volcanic arc succession; near centre of 
felsic volcanism (marked by coarse pyroclastic breccias or felsic dome); extensional faults.  
 
ASSOCIATED DEPOSIT TYPES: Stockwork Cu deposits; vein Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Au. 
 
EXPLORATION GUIDES GEOCHEMICAL SIGNATURE: Zn, Hg and Mg halos, K addition and Na 
and Ca depletion of footwall rocks; closer proximity to deposit - Cu, Ag, As, Pb; within deposit - Cu, Zn, 
Pb, Ba, As, Ag, Au, Se, Sn, Bi. 
 
GEOPHYSICAL SIGNATURE: Sulphide lenses usually show either an electromagnetic or induced 
polarization signature depending on the style of mineralization and the presence of conductive sulphides. 
In recent years borehole electromagnetic methods have proven successful. 
 
OTHER EXPLORATION GUIDES: Explosive felsic volcanics, volcanic centres, extensional faults, 
exhalite (chert) horizons, pyritic horizons. 
 
ECONOMIC FACTORS GRADE AND TONNAGE: Average deposit size is 1.5 million metric tonnes 
(1.65 million tons) containing 1.3% Cu, 1.9% Pb, 2.0% Zn, 0.16 g/t (0.047 oz/ton) Au and 13 g/t (0.38 
oz/ton) Ag ... British Columbia deposits range from less than 1 to 2 million metric tonnes (1.1 to 2.2 
million tons) to more than 10 million metric tonnes (11 million tons). The largest are the H-W 10.1 
million metric tonnes (11.1 million tons) with 2.0% Cu, 3.5% Zn, 0.3% Pb, 30.4 g/t (0.89 oz/ton) Ag 
and 2.1 g/t (0.061 oz/ton) Au ,and Kucho with a combined tonnage of 17 million metric tonnes (18.7 
million tons) of 1.6% Cu, 2.3% Zn, 0.06% Pb, 29 g/t (0.85 oz/ton) Ag and 0.3 g/t (0.009 oz/ton) Au. 
 
IMPORTANCE: Noranda/Kuroko massive sulphide deposits are major producers of Cu, Zn, Ag, Au and 
Pb in Canada. Their high grade and commonly high precious metal content continue to make them 
attractive exploration targets.

EXPLORATION 

 
     JNC Resources undertook a grid and roadside soil sampling program a stream sediment 
sampling and rock sampling program in May 2019 to investigate the mineral bearing potential 
of the Triple 9 property.  The soil grid portion of the survey was designed to identify potential 
geochemical trends.  The grid was oriented in a north south direction, with lines spaced 
approximately 100 meters apart with sample stations established approximately every 25 
metres. The road sampling portion of the program was designed to test between grid lines in 
the northern portion of the property and to extend coverage to the southern portion of the 
property. The grid portion of the survey covered 12.2 line kilometers of grid, while the road 
survey covered 11.5 km of road, resulting in the collection of 871 soil samples for analysis. The 
stream sediment sampling portion of the program was designed to identify potential metallic 
anomalies occurring in streams draining the property. A total of 21 samples were collected and 
sent for assays. The rock sampling portion of the program was designed to test by chip 
sampling, any potential metallic anomalous areas occurring in rock outcrop. Finally, a program 
of sampling utilizing a portable backpack drill was used to test for continuity of identified 
mineralization.  In total 119 samples were delivered for assay. 
 
     For the soil sampling program each sample site was located by a handheld GPS unit. At each 
sample location a 500 to 1000 gram sample of the soil from the "B" horizon was taken and 
placed in the corresponding soil bag. Each sample location was marked as a waypoint in a GPS 
unit in the map datum NAD 83.   The sample site was marked with pink flagging. Particulars on 
depth, color and proximal outcrop were recorded in a field book along with actual UTM 
coordinates as back up. 
 
     For the silt sampling program, the procedure for recording the station information and 
marking the station in the field used was the same as for the soil sampling except that 500 to 
100grams of silt material was extreacted from the stream beds.  In 5 instances, dry stream beds 
were encountered and thus 1000 grams of moss matt was collected at the sample site.   
 
      For the rock sampling program, the procedure for recording the location of the sample was 
the same as the procedures described for the soil and silt sampling.  Rock samples were 
described as being either float or grab.  A float sample is a rock sample taken from rock that is 
not attached to an outcrop, while grab samples are samples taken from outcrop but are select 
samples of the out crop. Channel sample are samples of rock taken from 5 to 7 centimetre 
channels cut into the outcrop to a prespecified distance. The rock lying within the channel is 
then chiseled out to a depth of 2.5 to 4.0 centimetres.   
 
     The author is not aware of any sampling or recovery factors that could materially impact the 
accuracy and reliability of the assay results. The author believes the samples collected by JNC to 
be representative and does not feel there are any factors that may have resulted in sample bias. 
There is no chance of bias in the soil sampling as these samples are just blind samples taken at 
regular intervals.

      The results of the soil geochemistry for copper, lead, zinc and silver are displayed in figures 
5 through 8.  The plots for these four elements show a coincidental, elongated trend beginning 
near the Bluenose showing then bisecting the property in a northeasterly direction for some 
2200 meters to the property boundary. This anomalous trend is open to the southwest and to 
the northeast.    
 
     The stream sediments results for the same four elements are shown in figures 9 through 12. 
The creek cutting the Road Zone and the next creek to the northwest both appear to be 
anomalous in all four elements: silver, copper, lead and zinc. 
 
     A total of 84 rock samples were collected throughout the property with anomalous results 
obtained from two zones, the "Upper Bluenose" showing area and the "Road Zone".  The 
sample locations are shown in Figures 13 through 17. 
 
     Twelve samples were taken at the Upper Bluenose showing area, as shown in Figure 4b.  
Five were float samples from the immediate area and seven were from the showing area, with 5 
of those being grab samples from the adit dump. The best result, a selected dump grab sample, 
returned 14.8 grams per tonne silver and 1.6% copper (TRC-49).   
 
     Thirty eight samples were taken from the Road Zone, an elongate area of some 200 metres. A 
total of eleven short channels were cut through the area, Table 4a. Channel sample weighted 
average highlights include Channel 2 â€“ 10.2 g/t silver and 0.14% copper over 1.40 meters 
(samples Y003385-87) and Channel 5 â€“ 4.31 g/t  silver and 0.23% copper over 2.30 meters 
(sample Y002297). Selected grab samples from the Road Zone returned 83.2 g/t silver, 1.23% 
copper 0.97% lead and 0.79% zinc (sample TRC-58) and 62.3 g/t silver, 0.929% copper, 0.413% 
lead and 0.265% zinc (sample TRC-59). In addition, several float samples returned high values 
with sample TRC-40 returning 1.96 g/t silver, 0.215% copper 0.01 % lead and 1.585% zinc and 
sample  851 returning 35.2 grams per tonne silver  1.235% Copper, 0.633% lead and 6.37% zinc 
respectively.   
 
     An additional 32 samples were also taken throughout the property, with one float sample 
returning 35.2 g/t Ag, 1.23% Cu and 6.37% Zn (sample 851). 
 
     The rock sampling program outlined mineralization occurring as massive sulfide pods and 
lenses with associated quartz veins and breccias occurring in both the meta-volcanics and in the 
orthogniess.

DRILLING 

 
     In addition to the ground geochemistry program the company employed a backpack 
diamond drill program over areas that hosted visible mineralization.  A total of 11 holes were 
drilled in an attempt to test the mineralized areas for continuity.  The backpack drill is capable 
of drilling to depths of up to 6 meters although on this program the drilling only tested to 
depths of 1.83 meters.  The drill is capable of recovering drill core of 33 mm in diameter.  The 
drill can be oriented at angles ranging 0 to 90Â° to the horizontal. For this program holes were 
generally drill between 80Â° and 90Â° to the horizontal. Drill core was sampled every 0.305 metres 
( 1 foot) interval. Due to poor recovery, no technical logs were generated and cursory geological 
descriptions taken.  Due to the shallow depths drilled no downhole surveys were attemepted.  
The core from the drilling was placed in a 3mill plastic sample bag with the drill hole number 
and interval written on the bag.

     The Backpack drill returned significant results from holes BD-1 and BD-2 drilled at the 
Bluenose showing:  returning 6.37g/t Ag and 0.32% Cu over 1.22 metres and 7.94g/t Ag and 
0.24% Cu over 1.83 metres, respectively.  Drill  holes BD-4, BD-5 and BD-6 drilled at the Road  
zone returned 10.25 g/t Ag, 0.13% Cu, 0.20% Pb and 0.11% Zn over 0.305 metres 6.32g/t Ag, 
0.074% Cu 0.18%Pb and0.057% Zn over 0.61 metres and   8.47g/t Ag, 0.14% Cu,0.32% Pb and 
0.12% Zn over 0.305 metres, respectively.  (Note the reported results are reported over 
intercept lengths and are not true widths).   

 
     The location of the collars of the backpack drilling are shown on Figure 17, while the results 
from the from the drilling are shown in Table 5.    
 
     The Backpack drill program was successful in intersecting anomalous mineralization at both 
the upper Bluenose and Road showings. While the drill could not penetrate to sufficient depths 
to determine the ultimate thickness of a particular zone, it did demonstrate that the 
mineralization can be measured to intercept lengths of 1.83 metres.   
 
 

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 
 
     At the end of the field day, all samples were brought back to town. The soil and stream 
sediment samples were put in sequence and placed 12 to 15 in a 13 by 18 poly bag. Three poly 
bags were then placed in a rice bag. Standard reference material packaged in a kraft styled 
paper bag, was also placed in the rice bag. The bag was then zap strapped and stored in the 
project manager's motel room. Since these were preliminary surveys no sample splitting or 
reduction was necessary.  Drill core samples were given a corresponding paper sample tag and 
the interval and hole number, and paper tag number were noted and recorded in a field book.  
All samples were delivered to the ALS Minerals Laboratory either in Kamloops or in North 
Vancouver, British Columbia by JNC personnel. ALS Canada Ltd. is an ISO/IEC 17025:2005 
certified facility. ALS Minerals is independent of both JNC and the Delorme group. 
 
     All samples are logged in the tracking system, weighed and dried. Silt and soil samples are 
first dried at 60oC and then dry-sieved using a 180 micron (Tyler 80 mesh) screen. Rock samples 
are finely crushed to better than 70 % passing a 2 mm (Tyler 9 mesh, US Std. No.10) screen after 
which a split of up to 250 g is taken and pulverized to better than 85 % passing a 75 micron 
(Tyler 200 mesh, US Std. No. 200) screen. A 30gm sub-sample of the pulverized rock sample 
pulp is leached with 90ml or 180ml of 2-2-2 HCl-HNO3-H2O solution at 95oC for one hour, 
followed by dilution to 300ml or 600ml and 41 element ICP-MS. 
 
     Standards from CDN Resource Labs were inserted at random intervals for the soil and rock 
sampling program. Nothing out of the ordinary was noted in the standard analyses providing 
confidence in the analyses provided by the ALS. 

 
     The author feels the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures for the 2019 
sampling survey on the Triple 9 property were adequate for the exploration program.

DATA VERIFICATION 

 
      The author viewed soil sample locations and verified the locations of soil and rock samples 
with a hand held gps during his field visit.  The author confirmed the ownership  of the mineral 
tenures and confirmed the mineral titles are in good standing.   The author is satisfied with the 
sampling protocols and procedures. A review of the assay data shows no irregularities in the 
author's opinion. 

 
     The author is therefore satisfied that the data is adequate for the exploration programs it 
supports for the purpose of this technical report. 

 
 

 
MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

 
     There has been no mineral processing or metallurgical testing undertaken on the Triple 9 
property. 

 
 

MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
     There are presently no mineral reserves or mineral resources on the Triple 9 property. 
 

 
ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

 
     There is no relevant information from adjacent properties to the best of the authors 
knowledge 
 

 
OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

 
     There is no additional relevant data or information known that is not disclosed on the Triple 
9 property. 

 
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 
     The author concludes  the geological setting of the Triple 9 property is in an environment 
conducive to the potential discovery of an economic massive sulfide mineralization. 
 
     The JNC Triple 9 project is underlain by rocks of the Eagle Bay Assemblage which hosts a 
number of Kuroko type massive sulfide deposits.  The soil exploration program conducted by 
JNC has identified a broad 2200 meter long geochemical trend which is anomalous in Silver, 
Copper, Lead and Zinc.  Coincidental with the soil anomaly two mineralized zones the Upper 
Bluenose showing and the Road zone occur within this  soil trend.   The rock sampling has 
returned significant assays of Silver, Copper and Zinc  occurring in massive sulfide lenses, pods 
and in breccias related to quartz veins which is suggestive of Kuroko styled mineralization.   
 
     The author is not aware of any significant risks or uncertainties that could reasonably be 
expected to affect the reliability or confidence in the exploration information.

RECOMMENDATIONS  

 
    The initial sampling programs have successfully identified a broad geochemical anomaly 
with coincidental anomalous rock geochemistry.  A 3 dimensional induced polarization survey 
is recommended to aid in identifying and outlining conductive zones occurring within the 
geochemical trend.  In conjunction to the IP survey the company should conduct backhoe 
trenching of coincidental geophysical and geochemical anomalies.  The cost of this program is 
estimated at $125,000.
