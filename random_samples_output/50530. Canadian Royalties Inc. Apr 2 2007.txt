CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The following report was prepared to provide an NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report and 
independent Resource Estimate of the nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group elements â€“ PGE 
(combined gold, platinum and palladium) mineralization at the Expo deposit, Expo-Ungava 
Property, Nunavik, Quebec, Canada (the "Property"), part of the Raglan South Nickel Project 
(the "Project").  
 
Canadian Royalties Inc. ("CRI") holds extensive mineral rights in what is referred to 
geologically as the South Raglan Trend, covering an area of approximately 1,040 square 
kilometres.  
 
The Expo deposit itself is situated on claim map 35 H/11 (Lac Rinfret), and consists of 500 Map 
Designated Units (MDU's) covering an area of 20,570 hectares. 
 
Expo is located approximately 80 kilometres west of the village of Kangiqsujuaq, (also known as 
Wakeham Bay) in the northern QuÃ©bec region of Nunavik, and is centred at latitude 61o 33' N, 
and longitude 73o 27' W,  (6,825,550 N and 582,250 E in UTM NAD83 Zone 18).  
 
Air Inuit and First Air have daily air service from Montreal and Val-d'Or to the coastal 
communities of Kuujjuaq, Salluit and nearby Kangiqsujuaq (Wakeham Bay). Air service from 
Salluit also connects to the community of Radisson in the James Bay hydroelectric development 
area. 
 
Heavy equipment, fuel and freight can be shipped to the coastal towns by boat (sea lift), with 
arrivals from July to October. In earlier years, CRI used the Xstrata Deception Bay port facility 
for sea lifts of fuel, supplies, and heavy equipment, but since 2004 they have used the facilities at 
Douglas Harbour, which is located 60 kilometres northeast of Expo.  
 
The Expo-Ungava Property, and the claims covering the Expo deposit area, are under option to 
CRI from Ungava Minerals Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ungava Exploration Inc. 
(together referred to as "Ungava Minerals"). As of the date of this Technical Report, CRI has 
earned an initial 70% interest in the Expo-Ungava Property, which was acquired under an 
agreement (the "Expo-Ungava Option Agreement") dated January 12, 2001 among the 
corporation, Ungava Minerals Exploration Inc. (formerly Ungava Exploration Inc.), Ungava 
Minerals Corp. (the two aforementioned companies hereinafter together referred to as "Ungava 
Minerals", Gogama Gold Inc., and 582556 Alberta Inc. Gogama Gold and 582556 Alberta Inc. 
executed the Expo-Ungava option Agreement for the purpose of vending to Canadian Royalties 
an underlying 2% NSR royalty. 
 
The general area of ultramafic-hosted nickel-copper-PGE deposits in northern Nunavik covering 
the Raglan Trend and the South Raglan Trend has been explored since the mid 1950's. 
 
Canadian Royalties acquired the property in 2001 and that field season they undertook a program 
of evaluating the historical diamond drill core from exploration programs completed in 1967-
1971 and 1997 by Expo Ungava Mines, Amax and High North in the Expo deposit area. 
Concurrently, they undertook a complete grid and drill collar location verification program. 
 
In 2003 and 2004 CRI completed surveys of the historical and most new drill hole locations, grid 
line locations and topographic elevation data to provide an accurate plan map of drill hole collar 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc. ii  
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

locations and elevations. From this, a basic contour map was prepared for the deposit area, and 
the grid was referenced to UTM coordinates.  
 
As part of the general exploration program by CRI on the South Raglan Trend, a substantial 
program of surface diamond drilling was completed in 2003 and 2004 that covered the entire 
known area of mineralization at Expo. Sixty-seven holes for a total of 6,747 metres were drilled 
in 2003 and forty-three holes for a total of 4,825 metres were drilled in 2004. Eight holes were 
twinned in 2003 and 2004, duplicating three holes originally drilled in 1967 and five holes 
originally drilled in 1968.  
 
The Cape Smith Belt in which the Expo deposit occurs is an interpreted foreland thrust-fold belt 
that constitutes the north-eastern extension of the Trans-Hudson Orogen, an early Proterozoic 
collision zone, which separates the Archean Superior Province from the Proterozoic Churchill 
Province. The Trans-Hudson Orogen includes the Thompson Nickel Belt of Manitoba, and the 
New Quebec Orogen (Labrador Trough) on opposite sides of the Superior Province. The Cape 
Smith (Ungava) Belt extends for 375 kilometres in an east-west direction across the Ungava 
Peninsula of Nunavik. The greenschist facies foreland portion of the belt is divided into three 
structurally superimposed Proterozoic units, from south to north and oldest to youngest: 
Lamarche, Povungnituk and Chukotat Groups. The amphibolite grade hinterland is divided into 
four structurally superimposed Proterozoic units from south to north; Sparton, Parent, Perreault, 
and Watts Groups. 
 
The Cape Smith Belt hosts two roughly parallel belts of intrusive ultramafic rocks, the Raglan 
Trend in the north and the South Raglan Trend in the south, some 15 to 20 kilometres apart. Both 
belts host a number of individual sulphide deposits developed in the ultramafic rocks that contain 
nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co) and platinum-group elements (PGE). While the general 
geology of the South Raglan Trend and Raglan Trend is similar with comparable sulphide 
mineral paragenesis and with similar sulphide textures, the Ni-Cu ratios are different. The 
Raglan horizon displays a 3:1 Ni-Cu ratio that contrasts with that of the South Raglan Trend, 
which is generally closer to parity. 
 
An extensive, irregular body of ultramafic rocks, typically 500 metres wide in outcrop and 
termed the Expo Intrusive Suite (EIS) by Mungall (2004), characterizes the general Expo area. 
The EIS "forms a complex of overlapping gabbroic dikes, ultramafic replacement bodies, dunite 
pipes, and sill-like peridotite massifs ... in the area surrounding the Expo Ungava deposit". The 
northern member or branch of the EIS, which contains the Expo deposit extends for a distance of 
nearly nine kilometres in an east-north-easterly direction and bifurcates several times, enclosing 
what appear to be large "horses" of host rock. There is an intimate association with a gabbro 
phase that, based on the mapping, becomes the dominant rock type along strike both to the north-
east and the southwest. The southern member, with a west-north-westerly strike, has been traced 
for a distance of at least five kilometres and joins the northern branch toward the west. The host 
rocks in the general Expo area are predominantly meta-sediments and the northern part of the 
EIS is clearly cross-cutting the folded host rocks, while its southern counterpart appears to be 
mostly conformable, at least in plan view. 
 
The local geology is dominated by the northern branch of the EIS, with the Expo deposit hosted 
by the northern split of the branch to the north of a large inclusion of sediments. This northern 
split averages about 200 metres wide on surface, and is trough-shaped in cross section with the 
southern contact usually steeper (sometimes near-vertical) compared to the shallower, northern 
contact. The essentially flat or somewhat undulating bottom of the central part of the trough is 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc. iii  
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

usually at a depth of about 100 metres. This local part of the EIS that contains the Expo deposit 
is referred to as the Expo peridotite. 
 
The mineral occurrences along the South Raglan Trend including the Expo deposit as well as 
those of the Raglan Trend to the north belong to the class of magmatic sulphide deposits. 
 
Four types of mineralization have been identified at Expo, of which three are of economic 
interest: 
 

1. The upper part of the Expo peridotite shows low-grade disseminated sulphide 
mineralization throughout. Metal values in this material are typically in the range of 0.2% 
for each of nickel and copper, 0.02% for cobalt, and 0.1, and 0.4 grams per tonne (g/t) for 
platinum and palladium, respectively, with very low gold concentrations. The average 
sulphur concentration is approximately 1.5%. This upper part is referred to as the 
disseminated domain. 

 
2. A net-textured domain shows elevated sulphide concentrations, and usually a relatively 

sharp contact with the surrounding disseminated mineralization. There is no discernable 
change in host rock chemistry at this contact. The net-textured domains have been 
defined by core logging based on textural observations and total sulphide estimates; 
information which was later supplemented by assay information to better define the 
boundary. While the net-textured domain tends to occupy the lower part of the overall 
Expo peridotite, there is often a zone of low-grade, disseminated mineralization between 
the lower contact of the net-textured domain and the lower contact of the overall 
peridotite. Net-textured mineralization is developed within the Expo peridotite over a 
strike length of nearly 900 metres, extending from section 9790 E in the west to section 
10660 E in the east. In cross section, the north-south extent of the net-textured 
mineralization is usually from 100 to 125 metres. The average length of intersection in 
this material is 16 metres which in many cases is close to the true width of the unit. 

 
3. Net textured to massive sulphide accumulations constitute a 9:1 ratio. The contact of the 

net-textured mineralization with the massive sulphides is even sharper than with the 
disseminated material. Small accumulations/short intersections of massive sulphides 
occur on nearly every section.  

 
4. The fourth and volumetrically smallest domain consists of vein-like mineralization that is 

found predominantly in the eastern part of the deposit, and usually at the lower and 
northern contacts of the Expo peridotite with the surrounding sediments. There is some 
question as to the continuity of these vein swarms. In some cases, continuity is indicated 
by the occurrences of vein-domain mineralization at the same structural/stratigraphic 
position in more than one drill hole and on more than one section. In other cases, 
surrounding holes are devoid of such mineralization. Sulphide vein intersections have 
been found up to 50 metres below the footwall of the peridotite, but these remote 
occurrences appear to be of local extent only. 

 
Petrographic work (Walker 2004a, 2004b) identified pyrrhotite (FeS) as the main sulphide 
mineral, followed by pentlandite ([Fe,Ni]S) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). Pentlandite occurs 
generally as a separate mineral and only rarely as exsolution lamellae in pyrrhotite. Pentlandite 
appears to be the main cobalt carrier. Niccolite (NiAs) and violarite (Ni, Fe)3S4 occur only rarely 
or are entirely absent. Intergrowth of both pentlandite and chalcopyrite with silicate minerals, 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc. iv  
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

particularly with serpentine, can be intricate. Magnetite (Fe3O4) is a minor constituent of the 
rock, the result of the breakdown of the original olivine into serpentine plus magnetite. 
 
In 2005 and 2006, the company continued with their exploration work. In 2005, 31 holes were 
drilled for a total of 6,152 metres. In 2006, 44 holes were drilled, including 8 geotechnical holes, 
four of which were sampled and included in the resource estimate.  
 
A Pulse EM geophysical survey was undertaken in 2005 in diamond drill holes EX-05-119, 121, 
124, 131 and 137. A fixed loop survey was also done. One target resulting from the two 
geophysical surveys was tested with no significant values being intersected in the hole. 
 
Half drill core samples of Expo mineralization were sent to SGS Lakefield in January, 2006 and 
again in April, 2006 with the goal of investigating grindability and flotation characteristics of 
blended Expo and Mesamax mineralization. Of principal interest was the metallurgical response 
to coarsening primary grind while maintaining acceptable concentrate recovery and grade. 
Results of the study are reported in "SGS Lakefield Report 10749-004 Report 8", dated August 
8, 2006. 
 
Three locked cycle tests were completed. Results from the best test, LCT1 are presented in the 
following table.

The Cu concentrate recovered 85% of the copper and graded 26% Cu and 1% Ni. The Ni bulk 
concentrate recovered a further 8% of the copper and 74% of the nickel and graded 10.3% Ni 
and 1.3% Cu. A 12% Ni concentrate could be generated, but nickel recovery would be poor, in 
the range of 60-65%. Overall platinum and palladium recoveries were approximately 61% and 
82% respectively. Detailed concentrate analysis identified no potential penalty elements for a 
smelter.  
 
The current resource estimate was derived from applying an NSR cut-off grade to the block 
model within a Whittle 4X optimized pit shell and reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for 
potentially mineable areas. The total resources for all domains are reported below at a CDN$ 
40/tonne NSR Cut-Off Grade.

Based on the geological continuity and grade of the nickel, copper, cobalt and PGE mineralized 
material, the authors believe an excellent potential exists to place the Expo deposit into 
production at the completion of the permitting applications, a bankable feasibility study, (BFS) 
and an environmental and social impact analysis (ESIA), which are currently underway. 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc. v  
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

There are presently 0.5 million tonnes in the Inferred category. Canadian Royalties should 
continue drilling to upgrade the Inferred resources to Indicated, though the impact on the deposit 
tonnage will be minimal. There are many gaps in the deposit due to an absence of drilling and a 
minimal amount of drilling should be done to acquire information in these areas.

CRI entered into an option and joint venture agreement (the "Option and JV Agreement") dated 
January 12, 2001, with Ungava Minerals Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Ungava 
Mineral Exploration Inc. (together referred to as "Ungava Minerals"), and with Gogama Gold 
Inc. (Gogama), and 582556 Alberta Inc. Pursuant to this agreement, Ungava Minerals, Gogama 
and  582556 Alberta Inc. granted to CRI an option to acquire up to an 80% interest in the Expo-
Ungava Property by incurring progressive exploration expenditures of $1,750,000 over four 
years (to earn an initial 70% interest) and by delivering a bankable feasibility study on the Expo-
Ungava Property (to earn an additional 10%). As of the date of this Technical Report, CRI had 
earned the initial 70% interest in the Expo-Ungava Property. The Option and JV Agreement 
stipulates that upon CRI reaching the 80% interest, CRI and Ungava Minerals shall form a joint 
venture. In the event that Ungava Minerals does not contribute its pro rata share of expenditures, 
CRI will acquire an additional 1% interest in the Expo-Ungava property for each $150,000 in 
additional expenditures made by CRI on behalf of Ungava Minerals. If Ungava Minerals' 
interest is reduced to 10%, its interest will automatically be converted to a 1% net smelter return  
(NSR) royalty, and CRI, at its option, may purchase the NSR during a twelve-month period 
following the commencement of commercial production, at a cost of $1.5 million. 
 
Additionally, on January 12, 2001, CRI purchased the underlying 2% NSR interest in the Expo-
Ungava Property held in equal parts by Gogama and 582556 Alberta Inc. (the "Gogama NSR") 
for a total consideration of $50,000. 
 
3.2 LITIGATION 
 
CRI has advised that since 2002 it has continuously defended ongoing litigation with Ungava 
Minerals.  The purpose of the 2002 action by Ungava Minerals was to annul the Option and JV 
Agreement described in Section 3.1 for the purpose of re-acquiring its interest in the Expo-
Ungava Property.  On October 31, 2002, CRI announced that a judgment had been rendered for 
this action in favour of CRI, thereby preserving all of CRI's rights and entitlements to the Expo-
Ungava Property.  Notwithstanding this judgment, Ungava Minerals continued to pursue several 
actions with the intent of re-acquiring the Expo-Ungava Property.  All of these actions were 
settled in favour of CRI, including an award confirming the vesting of CRI with respect to CRI's 
70% interest in the Expo-Ungava Property. 
 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 6 of 132 
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 
 

In December 2004, CRI won a third arbitration award, again securing CRI's interest in the Expo-
Ungava Property.  Subsequent to such third arbitration award, Ungava Minerals issued a news 
release on March 17, 2005 wherein Ungava Minerals stated that it would not appeal this award, 
and that it would commence working with CRI in a more cooperative manner. 
 
CRI has advised that Gogama, a private company indirectly related to Ungava Minerals through 
the common ownership and direction of two individuals, commenced legal proceedings against 
CRI at the end of 2002 for the return of its 1% NSR interest in the Gogama NSR.  To date, this 
action remains pending in the Superior Court of Quebec. 
 
In April 2006, CRI further advised that 582556 Alberta Inc. also commenced legal proceedings 
against CRI for the return of its 1% NSR interest in the Gogama NSR.  This action was initiated 
in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.  The case was dismissed at CRI's request, but 582556 
Alberta Inc. has since filed a Motion for Leave to Appeal the decision dismissing their case on its 
face value.   
 
In December 2006, CRI filed a Motion to Institute Proceedings against each of Ungava 
Minerals' current and ex officers and directors of Ungava Minerals.  With this Motion, CRI is 
asking the Superior Court of Quebec to declare Ungava Minerals and other defendants to be 
vexatious litigants so as to force them to ask the Courts for leave prior to instilling any further 
proceedings against CRI.  Additionally, CRI is seeking damages for the loss CRI had to sustain 
due to Ungava Minerals' continuous litigation.  This action is still pending before the Quebec 
Superior Court. 
 
The information in this section has been provided by CRI, and other than in our role as expert 
witnesses in the question of the earn-in by CRI as described in Section 3.1 above, we have no 
direct knowledge of, nor have independently verified, the information provided in this section 
pertaining to any legal proceedings regarding the Expo-Ungava Property.

4.0 LOCATION, ACCESS, CLIMATE, PHYSIOGRAPHY AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
4.1 LOCATION AND ACCESS 
 
The Expo deposit area is located approximately 80 kilometres west of the village of 
Kangiqsujuaq, (also known as Wakeham Bay) in the northern QuÃ©bec region of Nunavik and 
approximately 15 kilometres south of the Katinniq Mine, part of the Raglan operations of Xstrata 
Nickel, a subsidiary of Xstrata PLC, (formerly Falconbridge Ltd.) The property is centred at 
latitude 61o 33' N, and longitude 73o 27' W, (6,825,550 N and 582,250 E in UTM NAD83 Zone 
18).  
 
Air Inuit and First Air have daily air service from Montreal and Val-d'Or to the coastal 
communities of Kuujjuaq, Salluit and nearby Kangiqsujuaq (Wakeham Bay). Air service from 
Salluit also connects to the community of Radisson in the James Bay hydroelectric development 
area. 
 
Project logistics have been facilitated by the permission by Xstrata Nickel to use the nearby 
Donaldson airstrip, and service between Montreal and Val-d'Or via these airlines to Donaldson 
is provided on a weekly basis. CRI also charters weekly and bi-weekly flights from Montreal and 
Val-d'Or to Donaldson during the summer months to support the exploration programs.  
 
The property can also be reached by helicopter from all the coastal villages. Daily fieldwork 
requires helicopter support. 
 
In 2005, CRI constructed an access road from the Deception Bay / Katinniq / Donaldson / 
Douglas Harbour road network south to the Mesamax Deposit, which has improved access to the 
Mesamax and Expo areas. 
 
In addition, CRI has applied for permission to construct an additional access road in the summer 
of 2007 from Katinniq south to the Expo Deposit, which will reduce the requirement for 
helicopter support to the Expo area. CRI has applied to the MinistÃ¨re du DÃ©veloppement durable, 
de l'Environnement et des parcs for a Certificate of Authorization to build the access road. The 
request has been forwarded to the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission. CRI is currently 
awaiting the delivery of a Declaration of Exemption from an environmental impact study from 
the MinistÃ¨re du DÃ©veloppement durable, de l'Environnement et des parcs. 
 
4.2 CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The Expo-Ungava Property is located on a broad plateau, in an area of gently rolling topography 
north of the tree line, within the Povungnituk Range. The topography is characterized by 
moderate to steep east-west trending ridges and valleys. Vegetation consists of sparse shrubs, 
plants and grasses, which grow to less than 25 centimetres in height. Outcrop ridges are 
generally bare rock, devoid of vegetation, where outcrop or subcrop is commonly reduced to 
heaps of frost-heaved blocks and boulders. The low areas between outcrop ridges are typically 
flat, grass-covered tundra traversed by small streams. The entire area is affected by permafrost 
resulting in widespread soil solifluction, (a type of creep that takes place in regions where the 
ground freezes to a considerable depth and as it thaws during the warm seasons the upper thawed 
position creeps downhill over the frozen material. The soil moves as a viscous liquid down 
slopes of as little as 2 or 3 degrees and may carry rocks of considerable size in suspension), and 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 8 of 132 
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 
 

soil polygons. At Raglan, the permafrost reaches a depth of 400 metres, and the average rock 
temperature is -6 CÂº (Falconbridge Annual Report 1998). The elevation is 550-600 metres above 
sea level and the relief is subdued and ranges from 50 to 75 metres. Overburden in the area is 
generally less than 20 metres in thickness (from drill hole information). The climate of the area is 
harsh, with summer (July and early August) temperatures ranging from 0 CÂº to 20 CÂº while 
winter temperatures range from 0 CÂº to -50 CÂº. Snow can accumulate in any month of the year, 
and parts of some sheltered ridges can remain snow covered throughout the year. The field 
season for surface exploration activities optimally lasts the months of June, July, August and 
early September, with some early winter snow expected in late August and early September. The 
area is subject to strong wind conditions and periods of dense fog. 
 
4.3 INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
Heavy equipment, fuel and freight can be shipped to the coastal towns by boat (sea lift), with 
arrivals from July to October. In earlier years, CRI had used the Xstrata Deception Bay port 
facility for sea lifts of fuel, supplies, and heavy equipment, but since 2004 they have used the 
facilities at Douglas Harbour, which is located 60 kilometres northeast of Expo.  
 
A typical spring sea lift consists of 200 tonnes of supplies, including 3000 drums of fuel, drilling 
supplies, non-perishable food, and other project equipment. Supplies are transported by truck 
from Douglas Harbour to within 15 kilometres of the Expo site. In summer, a helicopter is 
required to move the supplies the remaining distance, while in winter supplies can be moved on 
land across the frozen tundra by tracked and all wheel drive off road vehicles. 
 
Canadian Royalties maintains a fleet of heavy equipment to facilitate logistics and road 
construction.  
 
The original exploration camp established by Expo Ungava Mines and Amax in 1967 to 1969 is 
situated near the south margin of the deposit area. CRI has re-habilitated many of the original 
structures, with the addition of facilities so that the camp can accommodate 32 people. 
Generators, running water, logging facilities, a satellite communications system, an office, and a 
larger hangar/warehouse for helicopter maintenance have also been added to the site by CRI, 
(see photo 4.1).

5.0 HISTORY AND PREVIOUS EXPLORATION 
 
5.1 HISTORY 
 
The general area of ultramafic-hosted nickel-copper-PGE deposits in northern Nunavik covering 
the Raglan Trend and the South Raglan Trend has been explored since the mid 1950's. Initial 
field work consisting of ground geophysics and surface sampling undertaken by New Quebec 
Mining and Exploration in 1957 indicated the possible importance of the Mequillon area. This 
was also the date of the first PGE assays on the property. There is no recorded work in the area 
from 1958 until 1967, when Expo Ungava Mines Ltd. staked the areas identified as being of 
interest in 1957. After completing a magnetometer survey, eight holes were drilled that 
discovered the deposit and provided a first impression of its character, predominantly in the 
western part. A more ambitious drilling program was conducted by Expo Ungava Mines Ltd. in 
1968 that consisted of 35 surface drill holes and essentially outlined the deposit over a strike 
length of 600 metres.  
 
Amax Exploration Inc. (Amax) became manager of the Expo project in 1968 and drilled a further 
32 holes designed to probe possible extensions of the deposit. Results were disappointing. Amax 
also carried out a preliminary feasibility study at that time, including preliminary metallurgical 
test work and open-pit mining studies. There were a very minor number of holes drilled in 1970 
and a significant program in the Cominga area (Expo complex west end) in 1971.  
 
The region was mapped by the Geological Survey of Canada in the years 1985 to 1987 at a scale 
of 1: 50 000.  
 
In 1997 High North Resources Inc. and Ungava Minerals Corp. undertook a confirmatory drill 
program (5 holes) and produced a resource estimate for the Expo deposit which post-dated the 
original one done by Amax in 1969. 
 
The Expo area was covered by several airborne geophysical surveys that were completed over 
portions of the Project. The surveys were performed by different exploration companies between 
1957 and 1995 as an initial effort to locate conductive target areas and to outline the favourable 
ultramafic rocks. A modern survey by Sial Geoscience Inc. covered the deposit and adjacent 
areas in 1995. The airborne surveys generally combined a magnetic and an electromagnetic (EM) 
component. Survey line spacing was relatively wide due to the anticipated size of an individual 
massive sulphide lens. The depth of detection was less than 100 metres, which, when combined 
with the wide line spacing, limited the effectiveness of these surveys to identify massive sulphide 
targets.  
 
5.2 2001 TO 2004 EXPLORATION WORK BY CANADIAN ROYALTIES 
 
5.2.1 CORE RESAMPLING PROGRAM 
 
In the summer of 2001, CRI undertook a program of evaluating the historical diamond drill core 
from exploration programs completed in 1967-71 and 1997 by Expo Ungava Mines, Amax and 
High North in the Expo deposit area (Durham, 2005). This evaluation was facilitated by the 
nearly complete preservation of most of the historical diamond drill core at the site, including the 
remains of the original core logging facility. The core was generally in reasonable condition, 
most of it stored in the original waxed cardboard core boxes. Most of the boxes appeared to have 
been left undisturbed for more than 30 years however in perhaps two dozen cases it appeared that 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 12 of 132 
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

certain well-mineralized pieces of drill core were missing, having been scavenged either by the 
original operators or by other exploration companies. The core boxes were generally stacked by 
hole and by using the readable outside markings, the footage markers, the historical diamond 
drillhole logs, and the available sample tags, the core of most holes could be re-constructed. CRI 
staff found that the sampling of the best mineralized intervals had been quite thorough although 
some lesser mineralized material had not been sampled.  
 
On the basis of these observations, a program of check sampling was undertaken in the summer 
of 2001 by CRI personnel. Care was taken to select for re-sampling only those intervals that 
could be positively identified as to drillhole number and depth in the hole. Mineralized material 
was sampled by splitting core in half that had not been previously sampled or had been originally 
sampled by filleting, or by removing the remaining split core interval from the boxes. Samples 
were bagged, tagged with part one of three-segment numbered sample tags, stored in shipping 
bags and eventually brought south to Val-d'Or at the end of the field season (September 2001). 
The samples were then delivered to XRAL Assay Laboratories in Rouyn-Noranda (XRAL) for 
analysis. The remaining 1967-71 diamond core and the core from the 1997 program remains on 
site undisturbed at this time. 
 
Of the originally more substantial Expo assay database generated prior to the CRI drill 
campaigns, a modest 375 assays survive in the current assay database. The strongly diminished 
incidence of the old assay data is due to the program of re-sampling and re-assaying described 
above, and the drilling of eight twin holes in 2003 and 2004, duplicating three holes originally 
drilled in 1967 and five holes originally drilled in 1968. The historical data that were repeated by 
CRI by re-assaying, re-sampling or re-drilling, were removed from the database and replaced 
with the new data.  
 
The re-sampling and twin drilling produced a substantial database from which to gauge the 
integrity of the 1967, 1968 and 1969 assay data for nickel and copper that remain in the database. 
 
5.2.2 GRID AND DRILL COLLAR VERIFICATION PROGRAM 
 
Concurrently with the core re-sampling program, CRI undertook a complete grid and drill collar 
location verification program. In 1997 High North Resources check surveyed a few identifiable 
drillhole locations. With these data, CRI was able to re-establish the original grid in 2002. In 
2003, 2004 and 2006 CRI completed surveys of the historical and of most new drillhole 
locations, grid line locations and topographic elevation data to provide an accurate plan map of 
drill hole collar locations and elevations. From this, a basic contour map was prepared for the 
deposit area, and the grid was referenced to UTM coordinates.  
 
The designation of the exploration grid over the Expo deposit, originally established in the 
imperial system, was changed to the metric system prior to the 2004 field season. No changes 
were made to the physical layout of the grid. The nominal basic section spacing in the metric 
system is thirty metres, which reflects the original one hundred-foot spacing, and as a result the 
location and name of a particular section are not exactly coincident.

CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

5.2.3 GEOPHYSICS 2002, 2003, 2004 
 
In 2002 CRI completed electromagnetic (Max Min) and magnetometer surveys on the re-
established grid. The surveys showed strong conductivity responses at the north and south 
margins of the Expo peridotite and produced a strong magnetic anomaly over the deposit. In 
2003, a time-domain, more deeply penetrating moving-loop (TDEM) survey was carried out by 
Discovery Geophysics Inc. in an effort to define extensions to the deposit. 
 
Also in 2003, a modern airborne survey using the AeroTEM system was flown on behalf of CRI 
by Aeroquest Limited of Milton, Ontario totalling 4,376 line-kilometres over the entire South 
Raglan Trend, including the Expo area. The AeroTEM is a time domain EM system in 
"Coincident Loop" configuration that uses a triangular shape primary pulse that records the 
decaying secondary magnetic field both in the "OFF" and in the "ON" part of the cycle. The 
vertical and the horizontal (along track) components are read. The system also includes a 
magnetometer, a GPS locator, and a radar altimeter. The survey platform was an "A-Star" 
AS350B+ helicopter. The "bird" housing the survey equipment had a nominal ground clearance 
of 17 metres. The Expo deposit responded to the survey as a series of EM anomalies 
preferentially located along the northern and southern contacts of the peridotite host rocks, 
confirming the earlier Max Min results. The anomalies appeared to be nearly continuous for a 
strike length of 900 metres, which is the extent of the deposit.  
 
Additional TDEM surveys in 2004 covered the south peridotite body, and a test gravity survey 
was carried out over the Expo deposit. The results revealed a weak and broad gravity high over 
the Expo deposit, but it is currently uncertain whether this represents simply the Expo peridotite 
or whether the deposit is also contributing to the response.  
 
5.3 2003 AND 2004 DIAMOND DRILL PROGRAMS 
 
As part of the general exploration program by CRI on the South Raglan Trend, a substantial 
program of surface diamond drilling was completed in 2003 and 2004 that covered the entire 
known area of mineralization at Expo. Sixty-seven holes for a total of 6,747 metres were drilled 
in 2003 and forty-three holes for a total of 4,825 metres were drilled in 2004. 
 
All of the drill programs at Expo completed to the end of 2004 are summarized in the following 
table.

The drill contractor in 2003 and 2004 was Major who used JKS 300 wireline drill rigs equipped 
to recover BQ-sized core. All core logging and core splitting was completed in a core tent at the 
Expo camp to which the core boxes were transported by helicopter. The drill core was logged by 
CRI personnel Todd Keast, Mike Collins, Myles Johnson, Pat Pope, Greg Huffman and Marcus 
Ralph. Discussions and observations between the geologists ensured consistent unit 
identification. The distance between the depth markers added by the drill personnel was 
measured to check for misplaced markers and for lost core. All logging information was 
recorded directly into laptop computers. Core intervals identified for sampling were marked with 
wax crayons, with sample tags placed at the start of a sample interval. Logging and sampling in 
2003 was in the imperial system (feet, inches), continuing the tradition at Expo, but was switched 
to the metric system in 2004. 
 
The sample length in obvious mineralization was generally 1.5 metres (five feet) in 2003, 
reducing to one metre in 2004. Individual samples were not allowed to cross lithologic contacts 
or abrupt changes in mineralization. Core was split in half using a hydraulic core splitter. After 
splitting, core samples were immediately placed in plastic sample bags, tagged and recorded with 
unique sample numbers. Where possible, contiguous sample tag series were used. Sample 
intervals were recorded on sample ticket books, and later recorded on the computerized drill 
logs.  
 
There were no obvious drilling, sampling or recovery factors that would impact the reliability of 
the core samples. The even distribution of the sulphides in all types of mineralization ensures 
that the samples are of high quality and representative of the material or mineralization being 
sampled. 
 
For a complete and detailed account of the 2003 and 2004 diamond drill programs, the reader is

Mineral Resource Estimate Expo Nickel-Copper Deposit, Nunavik, Quebec", dated August 8th, 
2005 and authored by T. Keast and H. Thalenhorst. This report is filed on SEDAR. 
 
5.4 PREVIOUS RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
There are several historical estimates of mineral resources for the Expo Deposit reported in 1969 
and 1997 by various operators. A table of the estimates is presented below.

5.5 PREVIOUS FEASIBILITY STUDIES 
 
Amax undertook a preliminary feasibility study in 1969, which included preliminary 
metallurgical test work and open pit mining optimization studies. The results of the feasibility 
study were not available; however the metallurgical test is summarized below. Details of the 
Optimized Pit Resource were also not available but the final resource number is presented in 
Table 5-2 above. 
 
5.6 PREVIOUS METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
5.6.1 1969 METALLURGICAL TEST ON EXPO AND RON ROY DISSEMINATED 

AND MASSIVE SULPHIDE MINERALIZATION 
 
In 1969 and 1970, Amax, in conjunction with Expo-Ungava, undertook metallurgical tests on 
both massive and disseminated mineralization from Expo, and Ron Roy, which is situated 
approximately 30 kilometres east of the Expo deposit.  
 
The tests included making four Ni-Cu concentrates and analyzing the concentrates for nickel, 
copper, platinum and palladium. 
 
Two locked cycle tests, designed to determine flotation characteristics were performed on Expo 
disseminated mineralization. The first was done on Expo disseminated composite Sample No. 1. 
Results from this test showed a 3 to 4 unit higher nickel and 1 unit higher copper recovery than 
the average of three similar tests performed on disseminated sample composite No. 2. It was 
concluded that averaging in of this test would not significantly change the Ni-Cu recovery.  
 
A third locked cycle test was run on Expo massive sulphides from Hole 69-31. The head assays 
for this test as reported in the filed report "Expo-Ungava Project, Preliminary Investigation. Cape 
Smithâ€“Wakeham Bay, New Quebec, Canada. Exploration and Mine Evaluation Division, 
American Metal Climax, Inc. November 1969. MRN Quebec, Assessment file GM 26102" were 
reported as Ni Total 3.04%, Ni sulphide 2.64%, Cu Total 2.51%, Cu-sulphide 2.49%, Fe 54.6%, 
Sulphur 23.84%.  The averaged results from the same report for three 300 gram concentrate 
samples from the locked cycle test were as follows: Ni Total 5.90%, Ni sulphide 5.49%, Cu 
5.56%, Pt 0.16 oz/ton, Pd 0.48 oz/t and Au 0.013 oz/ton. The approximate concentration ratio 
based on Ni sulphide head and concentrate grades is 2:1. Power consumption was 11 kWh/ton.  
 
5.6.2  2004 METALLURGICAL TEST ON EXPO NET-TEXTURED MINERALIZATION 
 
In 2004, net-textured mineralized samples representing the Expo deposit were tested at SGS 
Lakefield Research for flotation development on behalf of Canadian Royalties. Results were 
reported in report number LR 10749-001 Report No. 2, titled "Metallurgical Testing of Net-
Textured Samples from the Expo Deposit," and dated February 3, 2005.  
 
Mineralized samples grading 0.7% to 0.9% Cu, 0.7% to 0.8% Ni, 0.3g/t to 0.4g/t Pt, and 1.5g/t to 
1.8g/t Pd, were tested for hardness, rougher and cleaner flowsheet development and 
optimization. Locked cycle testing provided confirmatory metallurgical projections for each of 
two flowsheet types tested (bulk concentrate and dual concentrate flow sheets). 
 
Bond work indices were measured. Rod mill and ball mill work indices were determined to be 
22.9 and 19.9 kWh/t, respectively. 
 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 16 of 132 
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

 
 
Rougher kinetics testing concluded that: 
 
â€¢ Primary grind had a significant impact on copper and nickel recoveries. Rougher copper 

recovery increased from 69% to 90% over a respective size range of 177 to 17Âµm. Rougher 
nickel recovery increased from 67% to 86% over the same size range; 

â€¢ Lime was a more selective modifier against pyrrhotite flotation than soda ash; 
â€¢ Rougher collector dosages ranging from 35g/t to 140g/t had little impact on chalcopyrite 

(Cu) and pentlandite (Ni) rougher recoveries, but a significant effect on increased pyrrhotite 
recovery. 

 
Various cleaner circuit options were investigated, including those producing a single bulk 
concentrate, and one that produced separate copper and nickel bulk concentrates. No significant 
metallurgical differences were apparent between the flowsheets. Locked cycle testing confirmed 
the response of the mineralization to each bulk and dual concentrate flowsheet option. 
Metallurgical projections, based on cycle test results, are summarized in the table below.

Assays Distribution, %

 
 
Tests demonstrated that the most important variable influencing metallurgy was primary grind; 
metallurgy steadily improved at a finer grind with better grade concentrates, higher recoveries, 
and increased flotation selectivity among the sulphide minerals. Locked cycle test results 
confirmed that a bulk cleaner concentrate grading 18% Cu + Ni was possible with copper and 
nickel recoveries of approximately 80% and 72%, respectively. PGE recoveries followed at 
approximately 72% for platinum and 82% for palladium. A cleaner copper concentrate could be 
generated grading 27% at 65% copper recovery. The remainder of recoverable copper 
contributed to a nickel bulk concentrate with a Cu + Ni concentrate grade of 13-14%.

6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
6.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
The Cape Smith Belt in which the Expo deposit occurs is an interpreted foreland thrust-fold belt 
that constitutes the north-eastern extension of the Trans-Hudson Orogen, an early Proterozoic 
collision zone, which separates the Archean Superior Province from the Proterozoic Churchill 
Province (Hynes and Francis, 1982; Hoffman 1990). The Trans-Hudson Orogen includes the 
Thompson Nickel Belt of Manitoba and the New Quebec Orogen (Labrador Trough) on opposite 
sides of the Superior Province. The Cape Smith (Ungava) Belt extends for 375 kilometres in an 
east-west direction across the Ungava Peninsula of Nunavik. The greenschist facies foreland 
portion of the belt is divided into three structurally superimposed Proterozoic units, from south to 
north and oldest to youngest: Lamarche, Povungnituk and Chukotat Groups (Lamothe, 1994). 
The amphibolite grade hinterland is divided into four structurally superimposed Proterozoic units 
from south to north; Sparton, Parent, Perreault, and Watts Groups (Lamothe, 1994; St-Onge et 
al., 1992). 
 
The tectono-stratigraphic elements of the belt record a rifting event 2.0-1.9 billion years (Ga) 
ago, with accumulation of sedimentary and volcanic units (Povungnituk and Chukotat Groups) 
on a north-facing continental margin. Subsequent closing of the rift during the Hudsonian 
Orogeny (ca 1.8 Ga), resulted in a complex interaction of thrusting, penetrative shearing, 
metamorphism and imbrication of the foreland thrust belt with the tectono-stratigraphic units of 
the hinterland (Lamothe, 1994; Lucas and St.-Onge 1989; St-Onge and Lucas, 1990; St-Onge et 
al., 1992). After detailed geological mapping on the Expo Ungava Property in recent years, 
Mungall (2004) has queried the existence or structural necessity of the various thrust faults 
postulated by the earlier workers. 
 
The Property is located within the central portion of the assemblage, near the suture separating 
the foreland from the hinterland domains. The North Domain is dominated by the mostly 
volcanic Watts Group, which has been interpreted as an Island-Arc accretionary complex. The 
South Domain includes the Lamarche, Povungnituk, and Chukotat Groups, which are 
collectively interpreted as an extensional sequence consisting mainly of basalts, sediments and 
ultramafic rocks grading into oceanic crust towards the north. The boundary between the North 
and South domains is marked by the regional scale Bergeron Fault, considered to be a subduction 
zone (Bergeron, 1957; Bergeron, 1959; Lamothe et al., 1983; Lamothe, 1986). The basin is 
interpreted to record a protracted regime of extension followed by sea-floor spreading and 
subsequent convergent tectonics marked by folding and thrusting.

6.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY 
 
The Cape Smith Belt hosts two roughly parallel belts of intrusive ultramafic rocks, the Raglan 
Trend in the north and the South Raglan Trend in the south, some 15 to 20 kilometres apart. Both 
belts host a number of individual sulphide deposits developed in the ultramafic rocks that contain 
nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co) and platinum-group elements (PGE). While the general 
geology of the South Raglan Trend and Raglan Trend is similar with comparable sulphide 
mineral paragenesis and with similar sulphide textures, the Ni-Cu ratios are different. The 
Raglan horizon displays a 3:1 Ni-Cu ratio that contrasts with that of the South Raglan Trend, 
which is generally closer to parity. 
 
The Raglan Trend includes a series of ultramafic units of varying thickness that were intruded 
into a variety of rock types, predominantly sulphide-bearing sediments, massive mafic volcanic 
flows and gabbroic intrusions. The ultramafic flows or channels may contain massive sulphide 
lenses near their bottom that grade upwards into net-textured sulphides to be followed further 
upward by a wide halo of disseminated sulphides. The basal portions of the ultramafic bodies 
with their enclosed sulphide mineralization occupy topographic lows and are believed to be 
thermal erosion channels. The sulphide bearing sediments in the footwall may have provided the 
sulphur necessary for the fixation of copper and nickel within the immiscible sulphide phase that 
was then available for gravity segregation and accumulation. 
 
Mineralization at Raglan is associated with up to nine separate peridotite flows, which constitute 
an overall ultramafic body that has been identified along a distance of 55 kilometres. Deposits 
along this trend include from east to west the Donaldson, Boundary, West Boundary, 13-14, 5-8, 
Katinniq, East Lake, 2-3 Zone and Cross Lake deposits. The thickness of the sulphide lenses 
varies from a few metres to a few tens of metres, and the strike length can vary from tens of 
metres to 200 metres. Production began in April 1998 at Katinniq, which consists of over 20 
discrete lenses of massive and disseminated sulphide, which vary in size from 10,000 tonnes to 
1.4 million tonnes (Falconbridge Limited, Website May 2003). The lenses extend along an 
ultramafic horizon 1400 metres in strike length, which dips to the northwest at 45Âº to 50Âº. The 
mineralized horizon has been traced to a depth of 350 metres and is open in that direction. 
Proven and probable reserves for the Raglan operation as of August, 2006 stand at 14.85 million 
tonnes at 2.8% nickel and 0.77% copper (Falconbridge Archived website on Xstrata Plc 
website). 
 
Exploration work to date by CRI and previous operators has established a channel-like or trough-
like, or dike-like geometry of the ultramafic bodies on the South Raglan Trend, and the Expo 
peridotite is a good example of a series of trough-like geometry as further described in Section 
6.3. With the exception of the Expo area, the ultramafic bodies are generally from 100 to 200 
metres wide on surface, and extend laterally for several kilometres. These ultramafic bodies, 
some of which are open ended sub-vertical dikes are interpreted to be channel-flow units, which 
have thermally eroded into the underlying, overlying, and surrounding volcanic/sedimentary 
package. This is demonstrated by the observations that the ultramafic units clearly crosscut the 
volcanic/sedimentary package, that they have a thermal aureole, and display long, narrow 
sinuous dimensions. Others display more regular crosscutting dike-like characteristics.  
 
Massive, net-textured and disseminated sulphides are associated with the ultramafic bodies. 
Massive sulphides are generally comprised of more than 90% sulphides; the net-textured type 
contains approximately 25% to 75% sulphides while the disseminated mineralization contains 
trace to 25% sulphides. The massive and net-textured types carry sufficiently high base and 
precious metal concentrations to be of economic interest. The net-textured and disseminated 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 20 of 132 
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

types of mineralization are generally of much greater volume and extent than the massive 
sulphides, which accumulate at or near the bottom of the ultramafic bodies, or may be missing 
altogether. The massive mineralization may extend into near-vertical, narrow vein-like bodies 
below the actual closure of the ultramafic body and its associated mineralization for up to 100 
metres as has been observed at the TK and Tootoo occurrences. Massive sulphide bodies, the 
exploration targets of choice because of their high grades, are of relatively small size compared 
to their host ultramafic units. 
 
In the search for high-grade and high-value massive sulphides such as have been identified at 
Mesamax NW, TK, Expo and Tootoo, the identification of disseminated and/or net textured 
sulphide mineralization is thus key to exploration, as it indicates possible proximity to a massive 
sulphide component. CRI has demonstrated this by identifying massive sulphides at the 
Mesamax NW, Expo and Tootoo areas, which were all drilled previously by earlier operators 
without intersecting significant massive sulphides.

6.3 EXPO DEPOSIT GEOLOGY 
 
The geology of the general Expo area and the immediate Expo deposit is based on surface 
geological mapping by James Mungall from 2003 to 2006, the interpretation of geophysical 
information in areas of poor outcrop, and, on the deposit scale on the cross sectional 
interpretation of drill results.  
 
An extensive, irregular body of ultramafic rocks, typically 500 metres wide in outcrop and 
termed the Expo Intrusive Suite (EIS) by Mungall (2004), characterizes the general Expo area. 
The EIS "forms a complex of overlapping gabbroic dikes, ultramafic replacement bodies, dunite 
pipes, and sill-like peridotite massifs ... in the area surrounding the Expo Ungava deposit". The 
northern member or branch of the EIS, which contains the Expo deposit extends for a distance of 
nearly nine kilometres in an east-north-easterly direction and bifurcates several times, enclosing 
what appear to be large "horses" of host rock. There is an intimate association with a gabbro 
phase that, based on the mapping, becomes the dominant rock type along strike both to the north-
east and the southwest. The southern member, with a west-north-westerly strike, has been traced 
for a distance of at least five kilometres and joins the northern branch in the western part of 
Figure 6.2. The host rocks in the general Expo area are predominantly meta-sediments and the 
northern part of the EIS is clearly cross-cutting the folded host rocks, while its southern 
counterpart appears to be mostly conformable, at least in plan view. 
 
The local geology is dominated by the northern branch of the EIS, with the Expo deposit hosted 
by the northern split of the branch to the north of a large inclusion of sediments. This northern 
split averages about 200 metres wide on surface, and is trough-shaped in cross section with the 
southern contact usually steeper (sometimes near-vertical) compared to the shallower, northern 
contact. The essentially flat or somewhat undulating bottom of the central part of the trough is 
usually at a depth of about 100 metres. For the purpose of this report, this local part of the EIS 
that contains the Expo deposit will be referred to as the Expo peridotite. 
 
There are indications of multiple mineralized ultramafic units at Expo. In addition to the main 
body described in the preceding paragraph, there is a near-vertical phase below its eastern part 
(starting on section 10570 E) that may be a feeder to the complex and has been traced by a few 
drill holes to a depth of greater than 300 metres. It is also in this area that a lower repetition or 
branch of mineralized peridotite has been encountered on section 10540 E. Due to insufficient 
drilling, the feeder and the lower branch are presently poorly constrained in their geometry. The 
occurrence of massive sulphides in more than one "stratigraphic" position may also be due to 
multiple ultramafic events. 
 
The Expo peridotite has adjusted to greenschist metamorphic conditions during subsequent 
metamorphism. "Peridotite is almost invariably completely serpentinized, to form a compact 
rock highly resistant to weathering that is deep maroon to brown. Peridotite presents an 
extremely rough, hackly aspect on weathered surfaces but a smooth dark green to black fresh 
surface composed of a fine intergrowth of serpentine and chlorite, dotted with grey tremolite 
patches. Careful inspection commonly reveals the presence of intercumulus or poikilitic primary 
hornblende and traces of sulphides. The Peridotite is generally strongly magnetic due to the 
presence of abundant microscopic magnetite crystals formed during serpentinization of iron-
bearing olivine", (Mungall, 2004). The Expo peridotite is characterized by very high Cr (2500 
ppm) and Mg (15%) values, compared to the host rocks at both the Mesamax and the Mequillon 
deposits.  
 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 23 of 132 
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

Diamond drilling has substantiated the surface mapping and has shown that the host rocks into 
which the Expo peridotite was intruded are exclusively meta-sediments that are interpreted to 
strike east-west with a shallow dip to the south, based on core angles.  
 
Figures 6.4 and 6.5 provide detailed Gemcom cross-sections at two different locations along the 
trough. Figures 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8 provide schematic cross-sections at three different locations 
along the trough. Section 10540 E is at the easternmost end of the known extent of significant 
mineralization; Section 10360 E lies within the middle of the deposit, and Section 9820 E is at 
the west end of the deposit. Just west of Section 9820 E, the trough is cut by a gabbro dike. On 
the west side of the dike the base of the trough is much deeper, and has never been intersected by 
diamond drilling. East of Section 10540 E, the base of the trough is juxtaposed by a fault against 
a much larger ultramafic body that continues to the east with its base below the extent of any 
historical drilling. As the sections in Figures 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8 indicate, based on re-logging of 
several holes, the mineralized trough structure shows considerable complexity. At Section 10540 
E the trough actually comprises at least three separate intrusions separated by clearly 
recognizable screens of meta-sediment or well-developed internal chilled margins, and is 
underlain by at least five more separate sills, all of which bear some amount of sulphide 
mineralization, including two massive sulphide-bearing sills under station 10050 N. The exact 
forms of the intrusions cannot be determined from the available drill core information, because 
many of these bodies have sizes similar to the spacing between drill holes. Figures 6.6 to 6.8 
should therefore be taken as a well-constrained illustration of the structural style rather than a 
faithful representation of reality. At Section 9820 E there is one main intrusion that makes up 
most of the trough, and there are just two small and essentially barren intrusions immediately 
underneath. Several other small intrusions have been intersected under the main trough this far 
east by sporadic diamond drilling, but insufficient data exist to say whether the pattern at 10540 
E persists toward the east. A large dike-like body rises up from beneath the main trough and 
appears to join at between Sections 10540 and 10360 E. This structure may be the feeder for the 
entire system, but there are not enough data to demonstrate this. Similarly, there appears to be an 
overall decrease in the number of smaller intrusions under the main trough as one moves 
westward from Section 10540 E, but this may largely be an artifact of the paucity of deep 
borehole data in the westerly sections. 
 
The subhorizontal blade-shaped dikes below the main trough extend for considerable strike 
lengths along its base and may have been fed massive sulphide, but there is no direct evidence 
for this.

7.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The mineral occurrences along the South Raglan Trend including the Expo deposit as well as 
those of the Raglan Trend to the north belong to the class of magmatic sulphide deposits and at 
Raglan are described by Lesher & Keays (2002) as "invasive lava channels" carrying so-called 
Type I mineralization that is characterized as follows: 
 

â€¢ sulphides are distributed at or near the base of their ultramafic host rock units; 
â€¢ sulphide textures vary from massive at the base to net-textured to disseminated above; 
â€¢ grades are "moderate to low", and there is a slight tendency of fractionation between 

nickel and copper, and; 
â€¢ the timing of sulphide deposition is early magmatic with sulphide segregation having 

taken place prior to or during emplacement of the host rock unit. 
 
The setting of these channels is variable and includes "cumulate lava channels, subvolcanic 
feeder sills, or magmatic conduits" that "occur in a wide range of volcanic and subvolcanic 
environments" (Lesher & Keays, page 588).  
 
Mungall and Keast proposed a similar model in 2003. Mungall's on-going work in 2005 and 
2006 continued with the basic assumption that the parent magma to the Expo Intrusive Suite, 
(EIS) which hosts all of the mineralization of the South Raglan Trend, was a basaltic komatiite 
magma that was undersaturated with sulphide both in its source and upon its arrival in the mid or 
upper crust. The composition of the magma is represented on the property by a series of samples 
of chilled margins, the best of which are from a narrow dike in the Hilltop area which emerged 
from the main dike segment that runs from the TK occurrence to the Kehoe occurrence and 
includes the Expo deposit. Mungall's 2003-2004 work found that the composition of this dike 
served well as a model parent magma for the entire suite of cumulate rocks exposed in the EIS. 
The genetic model adopted was that meta-sediment was assimilated to produce ultramafic 
cumulates and a residual high-silica basaltic liquid saturated with sulphide.  
 
During later cooling pyrrhotite and pentlandite exsolved from a mono-sulphide solid solution. 
The Raglan deposits show repeated episodes of sulphide emplacement in multiple ultramafic 
phases. It appears that the Expo deposit may also show perhaps two or three magmatic pulses, 
but as described above, the understanding of the deposit is still in its early stages and additional 
research is required into this question. 
 
The general absence of strong fractionation of the sulphides into copper-poor and copper-rich 
phases is interpreted in the literature as due to the relatively rapid cooling of these systems, 
which is likely caused by their limited overall size. Larger accumulations of semi-massive to 
massive sulphides such as have been found at the Mesamax deposit, require the presence of 
footwall embayments that serve as physical traps. This is in contrast to the occurrence of the 
massive sulphides at Expo that do not appear to occur in embayments carved either into the 
surrounding country rocks, or into possibly pre-existing, earlier ultramafic phases.  
 
There is still no consensus on the details surrounding the formation of the Ni-Cu-PGE deposits 
in the Raglan area. Many of these issues will be discussed in exploration, government and 
academic circles for years to come.

8.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
Four types of mineralization have been identified at Expo, of which three are of economic 
interest: 
 

1. The upper part of the Expo peridotite shows low-grade disseminated sulphide 
mineralization throughout. Metal values in this material are typically in the range of 0.2% 
for each of nickel and copper, 0.02% for cobalt, and 0.1, and 0.4 grams per tonne (g/t) for 
platinum and palladium, respectively, with very low gold concentrations. The average 
sulphur concentration is approximately 1.5%. This upper part is referred to as the 
disseminated domain. 

 
2. A net-textured domain shows elevated sulphide concentrations, and usually a relatively 

sharp contact with the surrounding disseminated mineralization. There is no discernable 
change in host rock chemistry at this contact. The net-textured domains have been 
defined by core logging based on textural observations and total sulphide estimates; 
information which was later supplemented by assay information to better define the 
boundary. While the net-textured domain tends to occupy the lower part of the overall 
Expo peridotite, there is often a zone of low-grade, disseminated mineralization between 
the lower contact of the net-textured domain and the lower contact of the overall 
peridotite. Net-textured mineralization is developed within the Expo peridotite over a 
strike length of nearly 900 metres, extending from section 9790 E in the west to section 
10660 E in the east. In cross section, the north-south extent of the net-textured 
mineralization is usually from 100 to 125 metres. The average length of intersection in 
this material is 16 metres which in many cases is close to the true width of the unit. 

 
3. Net textured versus massive sulphide accumulations constitute a 9:1 ratio. The contact of 

the net-textured mineralization with the massive sulphides is even sharper than with the 
disseminated material. Small accumulations/short intersections of massive sulphides 
occur on nearly every section.  

 
4. The fourth and volumetrically smallest domain consists of vein-like massive sulphide 

mineralization that is found predominantly in the eastern part of the deposit, and usually 
at the lower and northern contacts of the Expo peridotite with the surrounding sediments. 
There is some question as to the continuity of these massive sulphide vein swarms. In 
some cases, continuity is indicated by the occurrences of sulphide vein-domain 
mineralization at the same structural/stratigraphic position in more than one drill hole and 
on more than one section. In other cases, surrounding holes are devoid of such 
mineralization. Sulphide vein intersections have been found up to 50 metres below the 
footwall of the peridotite, but these remote occurrences appear to be of local extent only. 

 
The net-textured and some of the massive sulphide accumulations do not occupy the deepest part 
of the Expo peridotite. There is a suspicion that there may be more than one generation of 
mineralized peridotite, but more research is needed before this question can be resolved. 
 
Petrographic work (Walker 2004a, 2004b) identified pyrrhotite (FeS) as the main sulphide 
mineral, followed by pentlandite ([Fe,Ni]S) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). Pentlandite occurs 
generally as a separate mineral and only rarely as exsolution lamellae in pyrrhotite. Pentlandite 
appears to be the main cobalt carrier. Niccolite (NiAs) and violarite (Ni, Fe)3S4 occur only rarely 
or are entirely absent. Intergrowth of both pentlandite and chalcopyrite with silicate minerals,

particularly with serpentine, can be intricate. Magnetite (Fe3O4) is a minor constituent of the 
rock, the result of the breakdown of the original olivine into serpentine plus magnetite. 
 
The results of detailed mineralogical work at the Mesamax deposit (Cabri, 2003) may be 
pertinent to Expo. At Mesamax, accessory sulphides are galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), cubanite 
(CuFe2S3) and cobaltite (CoAsS). Cabri also reported a large number of platinum-group 
elements (PGE's). He identified sudburyite (PdSb) and two new Pd-Sb minerals, Ungavite and 
Naldretite as the principal palladium carriers in net-textured and massive sulphides, respectively, 
and PGE tellurides such as michenerite (PdBiTe), merenskyite (PdTe2), moncheite (PtTe2) and 
kotulskite (PdTe) as well as sperrylite (PtAs2). Electrum (a gold-silver alloy of varying 
composition) appears to be the main gold carrier. Comparable detailed mineralogical studies 
have yet to be completed on Expo samples.

9.0 EXPLORATION  
 
Canadian Royalties undertook extensive diamond drilling programs in 2003 and 2004, which 
were discussed in Section 5. 
 
In 2005 and 2006, the company continued with their exploration work. In 2005, 31 holes were 
drilled for a total of 6,152 metres. In 2006, 44 holes were drilled, including 8 geotechnical holes, 
four of which were sampled and included in the resource estimate.  
 
A Pulse EM geophysical survey was undertaken in 2005 in diamond drill holes EX-05-119, 121, 
124, 131 and 137. A fixed loop survey was also done. One target resulting from the two 
geophysical surveys was tested with no significant values being intersected in the hole. 
 
James Mungall continued mapping and completed in-depth studies of the Expo, Mequillon and 
Tootoo deposits, specifically with regard to structural and genetic controls on the distribution of 
metals in the deposits. Dr. Mungall also conducted a series of modeling exercises which were 
designed to elucidate the origins of sulphide mineralization at the Mesamax NW, Expo-Ungava 
and Mequillon deposits.  
 
Dr. Mungall's results and conclusions have been discussed in Sections 7 and 8 of this technical 
report.

10.0 DRILLING 
 
Canadian Royalties completed a large amount of diamond drilling in 2005 and 2006, which was 
designed to expand the resources at the known deposits and explore for other deposits on the 
roughly 1,000 hectare property. The Ivakkak deposit was discovered in September, 2005 as a 
result of the property-wide exploration. 
 
The drill contractor in 2003 and 2004 was Major Drilling Group ("Major") who used JKS 300 
wireline drill rigs equipped to recover BQ-sized core. Major continued as the drilling contractor 
in 2005 and 2006. 
 
In 2005, 6,153 metres of drilling were undertaken at Expo, and in 2006, 4,578 metres were 
drilled, along with eight geotechnical holes, four of which were included in the resource 
calculation. The total number of metres drilled in 2005 and 2006, including the four geotechnical 
holes was 11,317.  
 
As part of the CRI exploration programs, the services of a registered Quebec Land Surveyor, 
(J.L. Corriveau & Associates), were retained in 2005 and 2006 to provide survey control for 
grids and drill holes. For Expo, the collars of all surface drill holes up to and including EX-06-
143 (apart from EX-06-141) have been surveyed by Corriveau using a differential GPS method. 
The surveys are considered accurate to within about 0.1 metres in all three dimensions. Drill 
holes EX-06-165 to EX-06-175 were drilled after the departure of Corriveau from the field and 
will be surveyed in 2007. Based on the experience with earlier holes, these collars are not 
expected to be more than three metres from their initial position. None of the unsurveyed holes 
was used in the current resource calculation, the impact of which is negligible. 
 
Drill-hole deviation was monitored with a combination of acid dip tests and Reflex down-hole 
dip and azimuth measurements. The acid tests were completed at approximately 50-metre 
intervals with one Reflex test at the bottom of the hole. Dip deviations are typically of 1o or less 
per 100 metres. Azimuth deflection of holes is more difficult to evaluate due to the magnetic 
nature of the peridotite body. Based upon the holes that were drilled far enough into the non-
magnetic footwall sediments, the Azimuth deviation is of the order of 2o per 100 metres. 
Deviations of this magnitude are standard for short holes such as drilled at Expo.

11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
For a complete account of the sampling method and approach for drill programs executed prior 
to 2005 and 2006, the reader is referred to a previous technical report titled "Technical Report on 
the Mineral Resource Estimate Expo Nickel-Copper Deposit, Nunavik, Quebec", dated August 
8th, 2005 and authored by T. Keast and H. Thalenhorst. This report is filed on SEDAR. 
 
Sampling method and approach were essentially the same for the 2005 and 2006 programs as 
they were for the 2003 and 2004 programs, and the procedures are summarized in the paragraphs 
that follow. 
 
All core logging and core splitting was completed in a core tent at the Expo camp to which the 
core boxes were transported by helicopter. The drill core was logged by CRI geologists and 
discussions and observations by the core loggers ensured consistent unit identification among 
them. The distance between the depth markers added by the drill personnel was measured to 
check for misplaced markers and for lost core. All logging information was recorded directly 
into laptop computers. Core intervals identified for sampling were marked with wax crayons, 
with sample tags placed at the start of a sample interval. Logging and sampling in 2005 and 2006 
was in the metric system. 
 
The sample length in obvious mineralization was generally one metre. Individual samples were 
not allowed to cross lithologic contacts or abrupt changes in mineralization. Core was split in 
half using a hydraulic core splitter. After splitting, core samples were immediately placed in 
plastic sample bags, tagged and recorded with unique sample numbers. Where possible, 
contiguous sample tag series were used. Sample intervals were recorded on sample ticket books, 
and later recorded on the computerized drill logs.  
 
There are no obvious drilling, sampling or recovery factors that would impact the reliability of 
the core samples. The even distribution of the sulphides in all types of mineralization ensures 
that the samples are of high quality and representative of the material or mineralization being 
sampled.

12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
In 2005 and 2006, split core samples were collected and processed by personnel under contract 
to CRI and under the supervision of Todd Keast, project manager in 2005 and by Pat Pope, 
project manager in 2006. After splitting and bagging, the sealed individual samples were placed 
in shipping bags, which in turn were sealed with plastic tie straps. The bags remained sealed until 
they were opened by ALS Chemex personnel in Val-d'Or, QuÃ©bec.  
 
All samples were initially stored in the field camp to await a scheduled flight. Samples were not 
secured in locked facilities as this precaution was deemed unnecessary due to the remote and 
isolated camp location. Samples were then shipped by helicopter to the Donaldson airport and 
loaded directly on a chartered aircraft for transport to Val-d'Or. Samples were collected at the 
airport by CRI personnel and delivered to the ALS Chemex sample preparation facility in Val-
d'Or.  
 
The split drill core samples were crushed in their entirety to 90% passing 2 millimetres and the 
crusher was cleaned with barren rock between samples. From the coarse rejects a sub-sample of 
one kilogram was split and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns. The pulveriser was cleaned 
with silica sand between samples. 
 
From each pulp, a 100-gram sub-sample was split and shipped to the ALS Chemex laboratory in 
Vancouver, British Columbia for assay. The remainder of the pulp and the rejects are held at the 
preparation laboratory in Val-d'Or for future reference. 
 
The base metals of economic interest (nickel, copper and cobalt), and elements of more general 
geochemical interest such as arsenic, chromium, iron, magnesium and sulphur, were determined 
using a 0.2-gram aliquot that was subjected to Geochemical Procedure ME-ICP81, (ALS 
Chemex internal code). This method uses a lithium meta-borate fusion to digest the sample, and 
is more appropriate for the concentrations encountered for the economic elements. 
 
The precious metals gold, platinum and palladium, were determined using Procedure PGM-
ICP27 (ALS Chemex internal code), a thirty-gram fire assay, again followed by ICP-AES, which 
is appropriate for higher grade rather than lower grade geochemical samples.

13.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
13.1 SITE VISIT AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLING 
 
Authors Eugene Puritch and Tracy Armstrong visited the Raglan South Nickel Project from 
August 17 to August 20, 2006. An independent sample verification program was conducted at 
that time. An attempt was made to sample intervals from a variety of low and high-grade 
material for several deposits. Two samples were taken from the Expo deposit, two from 
Mesamax, four from Ivakkak, two from Mequillon and four from Tootoo. 
 
The chosen sample intervals were then sampled by taking quarter splits of the remaining half-
split core. The samples were then documented, bagged, and sealed with packing tape and were 
taken to the SGS Lab in Toronto, Ontario for analysis by Eugene Puritch P.Eng. 
 
At no time, prior to the time of sampling, were any employees or other associates of CRI advised 
as to the location or identification of any of the samples to be collected.  
 
A comparison of the P&E independent sample verification results versus the original assay 
results for Ni, Cu and combined PGE (Au, Pt and Pd) can be seen in Figures 13.1, 13.2 and 13.3. 
The P&E results demonstrate that the results obtained and reported by CRI were reproducible.

13.2 CORE RECOVERY 
  
The core recovery of the Expo drill holes in 2005 and 2006 has remained very high, as was the 
case for the 2003-04 field seasons. Given the overall excellent recoveries and the even 
distribution of the minerals of potential economic interest in the core, there is no reason to 
believe that core recovery has in any way influenced the reliability of the assay database for the 
Expo deposit.

CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

13.3 DATABASE VERIFICATION  
 
The Expo assay database is assembled and kept by CRI personnel in Val-d'Or, who are also 
responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the assay results with respect to the laboratory 
performance on standards and blanks. The data are stored in a commercially available 
spreadsheet format that can be exported into GEMCOM software for later block modelling.  
 
Assay data are received electronically and imported into the spreadsheet without the need for 
manual manipulation. Sample numbers and intervals are checked against the data recorded in the 
drillhole logs. Routine searches are made for overlapping or missing assay intervals. Unsampled 
intervals have no entry. Results below detection limit were assigned one half of the detection 
limit value.  
 
After the first Technical Report and Resource Evaluation in 2005, which comprised all data up to 
December 31, 2004, all projects in the Raglan South Nickel Project were regrouped into one 
large drillhole database called Ungava_Master. Individual projects Mesamax, Mequillon, Expo, 
Ivakkak and other smaller projects in the area were relocated in a General UTM grid instead of a 
variety of local grids. 
 
Special attention was focused on the location and re-surveying of previous holes, and in 
particular: 

â€¢ Geologists spent time in October and November 2006 verifying the location of the holes 
on section and in relation to the old grid;  

â€¢ Discrepancies were corrected and documented by L. Cloutier, acting database manager 
for CRI; 

â€¢ When building the Ungava_Master database, the former database manager re-imported 
all assay data directly from the lab certificates, eliminating errors caused by Cut & Paste 
techniques; 

â€¢ Minor manipulation was required to transform ppm to percent for certain elements like 
Co and Cr; 

â€¢ Validation tests were conducted on all data from the database, comparing maximum and 
minimum values; 

â€¢ Small discrepancies in hole survey data were noted and corrected; 
â€¢ Un-surveyed holes from the end of 2006 were located according to the local grid; NB: 

None of the un-surveyed holes was used in the 2006 Resources; 
â€¢ Verification was done on all previous assay data by comparing the previous databases 

(Mesamax, Expo, Mequillon and Ivakkak) with the Ungava_Master; 
â€¢ Discrepancies were noted and each one was verified with the source and corrected 

accordingly; 
â€¢ Verification was done on all 2005 and 2006 assay results by importing original lab 

certificates into the database. Checks done comparing both datasets confirmed the 
integrity of the Ungava Master assay database. 

 
13.4 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
 
A thorough QA/QC program was instituted in 2002 and 2003 using property standards created 
from a large volume of drill core samples from the Mesamax deposit. Two different reference 
materials were made: Net Textured (CR-CS02-NT and CR-CS03-NTv2) and Massive Sulphide 
(CR-CS01-MS). Initial round robin characterization of the material was done by three different 
labs.  



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 42 of 132 
CZZ-Expo Report No. 129 

 
During the next three years, (2004, 2005 and 2006) both the net textured and massive sulphide 
standards were used systematically. Results for the net textured reference material were 
acceptable however the massive sulphide standard often demonstrated a low bias in relation to 
the characterization round robin.  
 
In 2005, H. Thalenhorst of Strathcona Minerals was asked to review the data and control charts 
for the 2004 and 2005 data. A recalibration of the massive sulphide standard was done at that 
time. 
 
In 2006, the results from the CR-CS01-MS standard were showing in excess of a 45% failure 
rate, which is defined as > Â± 3 standard deviations from the mean.  
 
It was decided once again to re-calibrate the mean and standard deviation for the massive 
sulphide reference material. The reasoning behind doing this is summed up in the following 
communication with Valerie Murphy, B.Sc., C. Chem., SGS Minerals Services - Quality Control 
Coordinator. 
 
"It is far more acceptable to calculate the mean and standard deviation with a large data pool 
over a long time period (even from a single lab) than to use data gathered in a characterization 
study that only involves a few laboratories. This is not just a more acceptable and rugged 
practice for characterization studies but even for certified reference materials as certificate 
values may be skewed and limited. Typically, a lab will generate large amounts of data that 
involves different operators, different days, different environmental conditions etc. to capture the 
true uncertainty of the material and hence the necessary criteria to set appropriate acceptance 
criteria." 
 
The mean and standard deviation were re-calculated using standard procedures of trimming 
values >2 standard deviations prior to determining the final value of these parameters.  
 
Once the massive sulphide reference material was re-calibrated taking into account three years of 
assays, the ALS Chemex results fell within the acceptable parameters supported by the fact that 
their internal QA/QC showed no failures.  
 
The low bias concerning CR-CS01-MS happened on September 29, 2006 with one failure and 2 
values between 2 and 3 standard deviations. The failed batch was re-assayed and all samples 
came back with values identical to the first assay, apart from the Reference Material CR-CS01-
MS.  
 
This only true failure, (September 29) appears to illustrate a problem with the specific standard 
sachet added to the batch. Apart from this particular case, the CR-CS01-MS behaves within the 
acceptable parameters.  
 
It was also decided to confirm the quality and the reliability of the Reference Material CR-CS01-
MS and three different labs were selected for a new round robin. 
 
Results of the new round robin indicated that values for copper were confirmed with a total 
average of the three labs close to the mean that was calculated from three years of repeated 
assaying. Nickel values were represented by a higher mean.

14.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
Canadian Royalties has a very large property package consisting of greater than 1,000 square 
kilometres in the South Raglan Trend. The Expo, Mesamax, Mequillon, Ivakkak and Tootoo 
deposits are all situated essentially in the central area of the property, (refer to Figure 6.1). The 
deposits of the currently operating Raglan Mine are located along a parallel belt of rocks 
approximately 15 kilometres to the north. 
 
The Raglan Mine, now owned and operated by Xstrata Nickel, has very similar geology and 
economic geology to that of CRI's Raglan South Nickel Project. 
 
The Raglan Trend stretches 55 kilometres from east to west, with a series of many high-grade 
ore deposits scattered along its length. While the general geology of the South Raglan Trend and 
Raglan Trend is similar with comparable sulphide mineral paragenesis and with similar sulphide 
textures, the Ni-Cu ratios are different. The Raglan Trend displays a 3:1 Ni-Cu ratio that 
contrasts with that of the South Raglan Trend, which is generally closer to parity. 
 
Mineralization at Raglan is associated with up to nine separate peridotite flows, which constitute 
an overall ultramafic body that has been identified along the 55 kilometres. Deposits along this 
trend include from east to west the Donaldson, Boundary, West Boundary, 13-14, 5-8, Katinniq, 
East Lake, 2-3 Zone and Cross Lake deposits. The thickness of the sulphide lenses varies from a 
few metres to a few tens of metres, and the strike length can vary from tens of metres to 200 
metres. Production began in April 1998 at Katinniq, which consists of over 20 discrete lenses of 
massive and disseminated sulphide, which vary in size from 10,000 tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes 
(Falconbridge Limited, Website May 2003). The lenses extend along an ultramafic horizon 1400 
metres in strike length, which dips to the northwest at 45Âº to 50Âº. The mineralized horizon has 
been traced to a depth of 350 metres and is open in that direction.  
 
The Raglan operations consist of open pits, three underground mines, a concentrator, power 
plant, accommodation and administration buildings, fresh water supply and fuel storage tanks. 
The mine site is linked by all-weather roads to an airstrip at Donaldson and to the concentrate, 
storage and ship-loading facilities at Deception Bay.  
 
Approximately 90% of the mining at Raglan comes from three underground sources, with the 
remainder coming from a series of open pits.  
 
The ore from the Raglan mines is crushed, ground and treated at the Raglan mill to produce a 
nickel-copper concentrate. Milling capacity is 3,000 tonnes per day. Nickel capacity at the 
concentrator is 26,000 tonnes of nickel-in-concentrate per year. Xstrata Nickel is in the process 
of expanding capacity at the Raglan Mine. 
 
The concentrate is trucked 100 kilometres to Deception Bay and then shipped via ocean freighter 
to QuÃ©bec City within an expected shipping season of at least eight months of the year, and a 
minimum of six shipments per year. From there, it is sent by rail to the smelter in Sudbury. The 
smelted matte material is returned by rail to QuÃ©bec City, and then shipped overseas to Xstrata's 
Norwegian refinery for refining into pure metals.

While the authors cannot suggest at this point that the CRI deposits on the South Raglan Trend 
will attain the scale of the Raglan deposits in the Raglan Trend, there is an undeniable similarity 
in host rock, ore genesis, style of mineralization and metallurgy.

15.0 2006 METALLURGICAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
15.1 EXPO/MESAMAX BLEND TEST FOR FLOTATION AND GRINDABILITY 
 
Half drill core samples of Expo mineralization were sent to SGS Lakefield in January, 2006 and 
again in April 2006 with the goal of investigating grindability and flotation characteristics of 
blended Expo and Mesamax mineralization. Of principal interest was the metallurgical response 
to coarsening primary grind while maintaining acceptable concentrate recovery and grade. 
Results of the study are reported in "SGS Lakefield Report 10749-004 Report 8", dated August 
8, 2006. 
 
Expo (EX06) mineralization grading 0.85% Cu and 0.85% Ni was prepared together with a 
composite of Expo-Mesamax (EXMX06) blended at 60:40, which graded 1.54% Cu and 1.42% 
Ni. Bond rod mill work indices were determined to be 18.1 kWh/t for the Expo mineralization 
and 15.1 kWh/t for the blended mineralization. Bond ball mill work indices were measured at 
16.7 kWh/t for Expo and 14.2 kWh/t for the blend. The results for EX06 indicated softer 
mineralization than previously tested Expo samples, but nevertheless still consistent with hard 
mineralization. The EXMX06 work indices were indicative of medium-hard mineralization. 
 
Flotation testing on EX06 yielded superior results over testing on previous Expo samples. In 
particular, overall batch test copper recovery was better at 86% compared to 79%. Copper 
recovery to the Cu concentrate more than doubled from 37% to 78%. Ni response was similar 
compared to a previous sample. A copper regrind was not essential to secure concentrate grades 
of >25% Cu and <1% Ni at a primary grind of 75 Âµm. A Cu/Ni regrind located in a post Cu/Ni 
rougher location showed better potential for overall nickel recovery than in the pre-rougher 
location. 
 
Rougher kinetics tests were completed on blend EXMX06 mineralization to assess the recovery 
impact of coarsening primary grind. Cu rougher recoveries improved from 95% at a P80 of 100 
Âµm to 97% at a P80 of 30 Âµm, while corresponding Ni recoveries over the same size range 
improved from 89% to 91%. Pyrrhotite-nickel selectivity was considerably worse at primary 
grinds approaching 100 Âµm suggesting potential difficulties for producing quality nickel 
concentrates at this size. 
 
Primary grinds set at 80% passing 75 Âµm were taken as the coarse limit of acceptable product 
size on blended mineralization such that saleable nickel concentrates might be maintained and no 
copper regrind required. The estimated impact of coarsening primary grind from P80 of 50 Âµm to 
P80 of 75 Âµm is 0.9% loss of copper and 1.3% loss of nickel. 
 
Batch cleaner testing optimized reagents, regrind position and regrind particle size. Copper 
concentrate grades of 25% Cu with <1% Ni were achievable. Regrinds positioned post Cu/Ni 
rougher stage and in the range of 80% passing 20-25 Âµm were required to achieve satisfactory Ni 
bulk concentrate grades. 
 
Three locked cycle tests were completed. Results from the best test, LCT1 are presented in the 
following table.

The Cu concentrate recovered 85% of the copper and graded 26% Cu and 1% Ni. The Ni bulk 
concentrate recovered a further 8% of the copper and 74% of the nickel and graded 10.3% Ni 
and 1.3% Cu. A 12% Ni concentrate could be generated, but nickel recovery would be poor, in 
the range of 60-65%. Overall platinum and palladium recoveries were approximately 61% and 
82% respectively. Detailed concentrate analysis identified no potential penalty elements for a 
smelter. Self-heating properties of the Ni bulk concentrate were not available at the time of 
issuance of the report.

16.0 P & E 2006 RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
16.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The purpose of this report section is to delineate the Expo Deposit Resources in compliance with 
NI 43-101 and CIM standards. This resource estimate was undertaken by Eugene Puritch, P. 
Eng. and Antoine Yassa, P. Geo. of P & E Mining Consultants Inc. of Brampton, Ontario. The 
effective date of this resource estimate is December 24, 2006. 
 
16.2 DATABASE 
 
All drilling data were provided by Canadian Royalties Inc. in the form of Microsoft Excel files, 
drill logs and assay certificates.  Thirty (30) drill cross sections were developed on a local grid 
looking west-southwest on azimuth 261.330 with a 30 metre spacing named 9,790-E to 10,660-E.  
A Gemcom database was provided by the client containing 265 diamond drill holes of which 204 
were utilized in the resource calculation. The remaining data were not in the area that was 
modeled for this resource estimate.  A surface drill hole plan is shown in Appendix I. 
 
The database was validated in Gemcom with minor corrections required.  The assay table of the 
database contained 10,392 assays for Ni, 10,738 for Cu, 10,932 for Co, 9,773 for Au, 9,931 for 
Pt and 9,935 for Pd.  All data are expressed in metric units and grid coordinates are in the 
NAD83 UTM system. 
 
16.3 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
A previous technical report authored in 2005 by Strathcona Mineral Services Limited verified all 
data entry, drill hole surveys and laboratory results and found the database to be in good condition 
and reliable for resource evaluation. At that time close to 6,000 samples made up the assay 
database.  
 
At the end of 2006, a verification of assay data entry was performed on 1,884 assay intervals for 
Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd. A few data entry errors were observed and corrected. The 1,884 
verified intervals were checked against assay lab data files from ALS Chemex of Vancouver, 
B.C., (three samples were still missing at the time of this resource evaluation). The 2006 checked 
assays represent 18.3% of the data to be used for the resource estimate and all verified assay 
results represent 76.5% of the entire database.

16.4 DOMAIN INTERPRETATION 
 
Domain boundaries were determined from lithology, structure and Ni, Cu and PGE boundary 
interpretation from visual inspection of drillhole sections.  Four domains were developed named 
Massive Sulphide, Net Textured, Vein and Ultramafic.  These domains were physically created 
with computer screen digitizing on drillhole sections in Gemcom by the authors of this report.  
The outlines were influenced by the selection of mineralized material that demonstrated massive, 
net textured, vein and ultramafic grade characteristics, and zonal continuity along strike and 
across the sections.  In a very few cases mineralization below massive, net textured or vein 
characteristic grades was included for the purpose of maintaining zonal continuity.  
 
On each section, polyline interpretations were digitized from drill hole to drill hole but typically 
not extended more than 25 metres into untested territory.  Minimum constrained true width for 
interpretation was 2.0 metres. The interpreted polylines from each section were "extruded" into 
Gemcom into 3-dimensional polygonal domains.  The resulting solids (domains) were used for 
statistical analysis, grade interpolation, rock coding and resource reporting purposes.  See 
Appendix II. 
 
16.5 ROCK CODE DETERMINATION 
 
The rock codes used for the resource model were derived from the mineralized domain solids.  
The list of rock codes used is as follows: 
 
Rock Code Description  
 
 0 Air  
 
10 Massive Sulphide  
 
20 Vein 
 
20 Net Textured Sulphide  
 
30 Ultramafic Rocks  
 
99 Waste Rock 
 
100 Overburden 
 
16.6  COMPOSITES  
 
Length weighted composites were generated for the drill hole data that fell within the constraints 
of the above-mentioned domains. These composites were calculated for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and 
Pd over 1.0 metre lengths starting at the first point of intersection between assay data hole and 
hanging wall of the 3-D zonal constraint. The compositing process was halted upon exit from the 
footwall of the aforementioned constraint. Any composite calculated that was less than 0.5 metre 
in length was added to the preceding one metre composite so as to include all composite data. 
This was done in order to not introduce a short sample bias in the interpolation process. The 
composite data were extracted to Gemcom extraction files for the grade interpolation as X, Y, Z, 
Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt, Pd files.

16.7 GRADE CAPPING 
 
Grade capping was investigated on the raw assay values in the combined domains to ensure that 
the possible influence of erratic high values did not bias the database. Extraction files were 
created for constrained Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd data within each mineralized domain. From 
these extraction files, log-normal histograms were generated and subsequently analyzed to 
determine the location of and capping value required to remove outliers that would unduly 
influence the grade interpolation. Refer to Appendix III for graphs.

16.8 VARIOGRAPHY  
 
Variography was not carried out on the constrained domain composites within the four domains 
in the deposit model. The mineralized domains exhibited good sectional continuity but due to 
erratically distributed populations, did not yield discernable variograms.

16.9 BULK DENSITY 
 
The bulk density used for the resource model was derived from measurements of test work 
performed by ALS Chemex of Val d'Or, Quebec on regular core samples obtained from the 
assay sample submission to the laboratory. A bulk density model was created from these data 
and utilized to calculate the reported tonnes. The average bulk density from samples was 
calculated to be 4.59 tonnes per cubic meter in the massive sulphide and vein domains, 3.11 
tonnes per cubic metre in the net textured domain and 2.92 tonnes per cubic metre in the 
ultramafic domain. 
 
16.10 BLOCK MODELING 
 
The resource model was divided into a 3-D block model framework. The block model has 
3,136,000 blocks that were 5m in the X direction, 5m in the Y direction and 5m in the Z 
direction. There were 280 columns (X), 160 rows (Y) and 70 levels. The block model was 
rotated 8.33 degrees counter clockwise. Separate block models were created for rock type, 
density, percent, Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt and Pd.  
 
The percent block model was set up to accurately represent the volume and subsequent tonnage 
that was occupied by each block inside each constraining domain. As a result, the domain 
boundaries were properly represented by the percent model ability to measure infinitely variable 
inclusion percentages within a particular domain. 
 
The Ni, Cu, Co Au, Pt and Pd composites were extracted from the Microsoft Access database 
composite table into separate files for each Mineralized Zone. Inverse distance squared (1/d2) 
grade interpolation was utilized. There were two interpolation passes performed on each domain 
for each element for the indicated and inferred classifications. The resulting Ni, Cu, and NSR 
blocks can be seen on the block model cross-sections and plans in Appendix IV and V. The 
grade blocks within all domains were interpolated using the following parameters.

16.12 RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
The resource estimate was derived from applying an NSR cut-off grade to the block model 
within a Whittle 4X optimized pit shell and reporting the resulting tonnes and grade for

In the anticipated open pit operation, Mill Processing and G&A costs combine for a total of 
($25.00 + $15.00) = $40.00/tonne milled which became the internal NSR cut-off value.  
 
In order for the constrained mineralization in the Expo model to be considered as a resource 
which is potentially economic, a first pass Whittle 4X pit optimization was carried out utilizing 
the following criteria:

(1) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  The estimate of 
mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, 
marketing, or other relevant issues. 

(2) The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources in this estimation are conceptual in nature and there has been 
insufficient exploration to define these inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource and it is 
uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured mineral resource category. 

 
The mineral resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and

Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by

16.13 CONFIRMATION OF ESTIMATE 
 
As a test of the reasonableness of the estimate, the block model was queried at a 0.01 % Ni cut 
off grade with blocks in all classifications summed and their grades weight averaged. This 
average is the average grade of all blocks within the mineralized domains. The values of the 
interpolated grades for the block model were compared to the length weighted capped average 
grades and average grade of composites of all samples from within the domain. The results are 
presented below.

The comparison above shows the average grade of all of the Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd blocks in 
each domain to be similar to the weighted average of all capped assays and composites used for 
grade estimation in the Net Textured Domain, however, many isolated higher grade assays in the 
Massive and Vein Domains are contributing to higher block model values than capped assays or 
composites. The block model invariably represents the metal distribution most correctly of all 
three methods. This effect is essentially the reverse of assay data clustering. 
 
In addition, a volumetric comparison was performed with the block volume of the model vs. the 
geometric calculated volume of the domain solids.

18.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
18.1 CONCLUSIONS 
 
The Expo nickel, copper, cobalt PGE deposit was modeled under current CIM resource 
definitions (December, 2005) and in accordance with accepted industry practice. NI 43-101 
reporting standards and formats were followed in this document in order to report the mineral 
resource in a fully compliant manner.  
 
The Indicated Resources as reported have demonstrated mineralized continuity, shape, density 
and grade, which have been well established based on thirty (30) drill cross sections developed on 
a local grid looking west-southwest on azimuth 261.33Âº with a 30 metre spacing. The resource 
classifications were determined from the Ni interpolations for Indicated and Inferred due to Ni 
being the dominant revenue-producing element in the NSR calculation. All blocks coded by the 
first interpolation pass were coded as Indicated while the remaining blocks coded on the second 
interpolation pass were classified as Inferred.  
 
The definition of Indicated and Inferred Resources is in compliance with the CIM Definitions and 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, December 11, 2005.  
 
Verification of assay data entry was performed on 1,884 assay intervals for Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt 
and Pd. A few data entry errors were observed and corrected. The 1,884 verified intervals were 
checked against assay lab data files from ALS Chemex of Vancouver, B.C., (three samples were 
still missing at the time of the resource evaluation). The 2006 checked assays represent 18.3% of 
the data used for the resource estimate and all verified assay results represent 76.5% of the entire 
database.  
 
The mineral resource estimate has delineated tonnage and grade for nickel, copper, cobalt and 
PGE in the Indicated and Inferred categories based on a $CDN 40/tonne NSR cut-off grade, 
relying on all available data as of the effective date of this report.  
 

Based on the geological continuity and grade of the nickel, copper, cobalt and PGE mineralized 
material, the authors believe an excellent potential exists to place the Expo deposit into 
production at the completion of the permitting applications, a bankable feasibility study, (BFS) 
and an environmental and social impact analysis (ESIA), which are being undertaken at the 
present time. 

 
18.2  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The Bankable Feasibility Study, (BFS) and Environmental and Social Impact Analysis (ESIA) 
are currently underway. The authors feel that the deposit is advanced to a level such that a 
production decision will be the likely outcome from the current studies. Assuming the results are 
positive, the next step will be to delineation drill for production. 
 
There are presently 0.5 million tonnes in the Inferred category. Canadian Royalties should 
continue drilling to upgrade the Inferred resources to Indicated, though the impact on the deposit 
tonnage will be minimal. There are many gaps in the deposit due to an absence of drilling and a 
minimal amount of drilling should be done to acquire information in these areas. A proposed
