1.0 SUMMARY 
 
1.1 Introduction 
 
Mine Development Associates ("MDA") has prepared this technical report on the West Desert zinc-
copper-indium-magnetite project, located in Juab County, Utah, at the request of InZinc Mining Ltd. 
("InZinc"), formerly called Lithic Resources Ltd.  The project was formerly called the Crypto project.  
 
The purpose of this report is to provide a technical summary containing an updated mineral resource 
estimate and an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") of the West Desert project.  Note 
that a preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature.  It includes Inferred mineral resources 
that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied that would 
enable them to be classified as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment 
will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability.   
 
This report was written in compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the 
Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"), Companion Policy 43-
101CP, and Form 43-101F1.  MDA classified the West Desert resources as defined by the Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") in December 2000 and modified in 2005 and 
2010, so as to be in compliance with NI 43-101.  
 
1.2 Property Description and Ownership 
 
The West Desert project is located in west-central Utah, approximately 160km southwest of Salt Lake 
City.   The property consists of 198 unpatented lode mining claims; all or part interest in 20 patented 
mining claims, which are now private land; and one state mineral lease.  The property has an aggregate 
area of approximately 1,924ha and is situated in Sections 7, 9, and 16-21, Township 11 South, Range 14 
West, and in Sections 12, 13, and 24, Township 11 South, Range 15 West, Salt Lake Base Meridian.  All 
titles are held either in the name of Lithic Resources Ltd. (now called InZinc) or its U. S. subsidiary, 
N.P.R. (US), Inc.   
 
The West Desert property is subject to a 1.5% Net Smelter Return ("NSR") royalty interest on all 
production payable to BCKP Limited, who is also entitled to receive a one-time cash payment of 
C$1,000,000 upon InZinc's securing financing to bring the West Desert property into production.

The state mineral lease carries a Gross Smelter Return ("GSR") royalty of 8% for fissionable 
metalliferous materials and 4% for non-fissionable metalliferous minerals, but none of the current 
resource is contained within the leased state lands. 
 
1.3 Geology and Mineralization 
 
The West Desert property is located in the Fish Springs Range, one of the roughly north-trending 
mountain ranges of the Basin and Range physiographic province extending throughout Nevada and 
western Utah.  
 
The property is underlain by lower Cambrian to upper Devonian dolostones, thin-bedded limestones, 
and minor interbedded quartzites and shales.  This sedimentary package has been intruded by a Late 
Eocene felsic intrusive complex, which underlies a large part of the property at depth but is not exposed 
at the surface.  In the vicinity of the West Desert deposit, it rises to the bedrock surface in a cupola that 
sub-crops below shallow Pleistocene gravels.   
 
The Juab fault, a west-northwest-trending, north-dipping normal fault, trends through the middle of the 
property.  The fault is significant enough to have caused a conspicuous left-lateral offset of the Fish 
Springs Range and is thought to have on the order of 500-600m of net vertical displacement.  The north-
trending Overland fault along the western margin of the Fish Spring Range, together with a number of 
lesser sub-parallel faults, are normal with west-side down and represent extensional faulting typical of 
the Basin and Range Province.  
 
Thin-bedded carbonate rocks near the intrusive complex, particularly those with shaley partings, have 
been altered to skarn, marble, and siliceous hornfels.  More thickly bedded to massive dolostones tend to 
be converted to marble.  Zinc-copper-indium-magnetite mineralization of the West Desert deposit 
occurs in portions of the skarn. 
 
Two main zones of mineralization have been identified, the Main and Deep zones, neither of which is 
exposed in outcrop.  The two zones are separated by the Juab fault.  The Main Zone is hosted within 
Ordovician carbonate rocks immediately south of the sub-cropping quartz monzonite cupola and north 
of the Juab fault.  Main Zone mineralization has been traced with drilling over a strike length of about 
525m, a width of about 150m, and to a depth of 575m and remains open to the west and to depth.  The 
Main Zone has been oxidized to an average depth of about 200m.  The Deep Zone is hosted 
predominantly within Cambrian thinly bedded, shaly limestones immediately south of the Juab fault.  
Deep Zone mineralization often occurs as proximal skarn, with greater than 50 percent massive 
magnetite, along the contact with an underlying quartz monzonite intrusion.  At least three separate 
mineralized stratabound horizons have been identified within the Deep Zone over an area of about 330m 
by 225m and at depths of between about 450m to 750m.  They remain open to the west, south, and 
possibly the east. 
 
Mineralization at West Desert consists of sphalerite with lesser chalcopyrite occurring commonly (but 
not exclusively) with massive magnetite in both concordant and discordant skarn and replacement 
bodies.  Indium occurs predominantly as lattice substitution in sphalerite.

1.4 Exploration and Mining History 
 
The West Desert project is situated in the historic Fish Springs mining district, from which about 7.9 
million kilograms of lead, 1,300kg of zinc, 2,400kg of copper, 500 ounces of gold, and 2.7 million 
ounces of silver were produced from 1890 to 1953.  This mineralization came from oxidized 
replacement deposits located east and southeast of the current West Desert resource area. 
 
The West Desert project area was at one time or another held or optioned by Kennecott Copper 
Corporation ("Kennecott"), Pinnacle Exploration Inc. ("Pinnacle"), Utah Construction & Mining 
("Utah," later Utah International Inc.), Noble Peak Resources Ltd. ("Noble Peak"), Cyprus Minerals 
Company ("Cyprus" (in a joint venture with Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. Ltd.)), Sierra Gigantes 
Resources Inc., and EuroZinc Mining Corporation.  Lithic Resources Ltd. (now InZinc) purchased the 
property from EuroZinc in 2005 through the purchase of N.P.R. (US), Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of EuroZinc, and subsequently expanded the property holdings.  The Main Zone was discovered by 
Utah, and the Deep Zone was later confirmed as a separate zone and expanded by Cyprus.  Historic 
resource estimates were made by Utah in 1976, Cyprus in 1991 and 1993, and Noble Peak in 1995, but 
all of these were made prior to the NI 43-101 reporting requirements. 
 
Since acquiring the property, InZinc has completed aerial photography and photogrammetry, pole-dipole 
induced polarization surveying, and helicopter-borne magnetic surveying.  In 2007-2008, InZinc 
completed a program of 10,639m of core drilling in 17 holes.  In 2009, they commissioned preliminary 
metallurgical test work on both sulfide and oxide mineralization, with a follow-up test-work program 
completed in April 2013 to evaluate the production of magnetite concentrates. 
 
1.5 Drilling and Sampling 
 
Four campaigns of drilling resulting in 75 diamond core and 10 reverse circulation ("RC") exploration 
holes totaling 38,138m have been carried out on the West Desert property.  The drilling was conducted 
by Pinnacle (1958-1959), Utah (1961-1979), Cyprus (1990-1991), and InZinc (2007-2008).  InZinc's 
drilling totaled 17 core holes for 10,639m 
 
InZinc's samples were analyzed for a suite of 48 elements including zinc, copper, indium, and total iron 
by ALS Chemex.  Total iron, iron-as-magnetite (Davis tube), and magnetite analyses were conducted by 
AGAT laboratories with check analyses at ALS Chemex.  InZinc implemented a quality-control 
protocol involving a variety of standards and duplicates as well as a blank for all of its sampling on the 
project.   
 
Indium is present in the West Desert deposit at unusually high levels.  However, the historic operators 
did not assay their drill core samples for indium.  Zinc, copper, and iron content was, on the other hand, 
easily recognized and is more common to all data sets. 
 
MDA has audited the historic database using the available sources and has not identified any systematic 
problems; however, one deficiency is the lack of original analytical certificates from exploration 
programs conducted prior to InZinc's ownership.  As a result, MDA cannot state that it has checked the 
historic database using entirely original sources.  MDA found no significant issues in its audit of 
InZinc's entries in the database.

1.6 Metallurgical Testing 
 
InZinc has contracted metallurgical testing of the West Desert project to two metallurgical testing firms 
in order to support the PEA, with the intent of maximizing the value obtained from copper, zinc, iron, 
and by-product precious metals.  Previous metallurgical test work completed by Cyprus in 1991 focused 
on zinc flotation.  Recent flotation test work completed by G&T Metallurgical Services Ltd. ("G&T") of 
Kamloops, Canada, in 2009 was focused on copper and zinc flotation.  Additional test work by G&T in 
2013 evaluated the option of producing an iron concentrate from the West Desert materials.   
 
Kappes, Cassiday & Associates completed a series of leach and concentration tests on a composite of 
oxide zinc mineralization constructed from samples taken from a variety of InZinc's drill intercepts.  
The oxide mineralization is not included in the PEA.   
 
The sample materials used in G&T's 2009 test work were drill-core composites representing three sub-
sets of sulfide mineralization:  copper-zinc, high-grade zinc, and low-grade zinc mineralization.  
Determination of a Bond ball mill work index, grinding and flotation tests, open-circuit and locked-cycle 
tests, and preliminary testing to investigate the potential to recover a magnetite concentrate were 
undertaken in this test program.   
 
The initial testing on the copper-zinc composite, along with subsequent testing on the low-grade zinc 
and high-grade zinc composites, indicated a similar moderate hardness.  Energy requirements were 
expected to be similar for all three types of mineralization.   
 
Mineral fragmentation analysis of the three flotation composites was completed, and a target primary 
grind (P80) of 65 microns was selected for flotation test work.  Re-grinding of rough flotation 
concentrates is required and is expected to be in the range of 20 to 30 microns. 
 
Open-circuit bench-scale testing to evaluate the recovery of copper and zinc determined that the use of 
zinc depressants, ZnSO4 and NaCN, was essential to control the recovery of zinc to the copper 
concentrate, thereby optimizing the performance of the zinc recovery circuit.  The open-circuit test work 
also indicated that rougher concentrate regrinds were essential for both the copper and zinc circuits in 
order to optimize the concentrate grades and recoveries.  Additional test work for the optimization of the 
flotation process is still required.   
 
The metallurgical test work that has been completed by G&T confirms that the sulfide zone of the West 
Desert project will be amenable to processing using a conventional copper-zinc differential flotation 
process.  The open-circuit test work provided the preliminary criteria to develop flotation locked-cycle 
test procedures.  Locked-cycle tests were completed to confirm recoveries and concentrate grades 
identified by the open-circuit tests.  Copper concentrates of approximately 29 percent copper are 
predicted with a copper recovery of approximately 74 percent.  Zinc concentrates of approximately 55 
percent zinc are predicted with a zinc recovery of approximately 92 percent.  Gold, silver, and indium 
will be recovered to the copper and zinc concentrates to various degrees.  Deleterious elements were not 
found to be present in the copper and zinc flotation concentrates at penalty levels.

Results of the G&T sulfide flotation test work were consistent with work completed by Cyprus in 1991 
that identified the potential to recover zinc to a marketable zinc concentrate.  Optimization of the 
flotation process is required with sample materials more representative of planned mine production.   
 
Metallurgical test work specific to the production of an iron concentrate demonstrated that saleable iron 
concentrates can be produced from the West Desert materials using traditional magnetic separation 
techniques.  Iron concentrates in the range of 63 to 65 percent iron were produced by G&T, with very 
high iron recoveries.  Iron recoveries of approximately 96 percent were observed.  Approximately 30 to 
50 percent of run-of-mine production is expected to be recoverable as a magnetite concentrate.  It is 
expected that iron concentrate production will precede the copper and zinc flotation process in order to 
reduce tonnages seen in flotation, as well as benefit the reagent usage in flotation.    
 
At this time, there appear to be no metallurgical impediments to the further, successful development of 
the project. 
 
1.7 Mineral Resource Estimation 
 
Upon completion of the database validation process, MDA used a combination of lithology, structural 
data, and logged sulfide percentages to construct a cross-sectional geologic model which formed the 
basis for the density model and metal domain models.  Individual domain models were made for zinc, 
copper, indium, and iron.  MDA assigned density values to various groups of rocks ranging from a low 
of 2.45 to a high of 3.97 g/cm3.  The significant range in density values reflects the variable high-sulfide 
or high-magnetite content within the various lithologies.  
   
Quantile plots of zinc, copper, and iron in percent and indium in grams per tonne were made to help 
define the natural populations of metal grades to be modeled on the cross sections.  The analytical 
population breaks indicated by the quantile plots along with the geological interpretation were used in 
the creation of distinct mineral domains.  The interpreted cross sections were then sliced to levels on 3m 
intervals to coincide with the mid-bench block-model levels.  The defined metal mineral domains were 
used to code the drill samples and control the resource estimation. 
 
Mineral domain statistics, and spatial location of higher grades, were made to assess validity of these 
domains and to determine capping levels.  After these analyses, MDA chose to cap 23 samples for zinc, 
copper, and indium and one sample for iron.  Compositing was done to 3m down-hole lengths, honoring 
all material type and mineral domain boundaries.  The 2m by 2m by 3m blocks inside each mineral 
domain were estimated using only composites from inside that domain. 
 
Two passes using inverse distance (cubed) techniques were made in the estimate: a long pass to ensure 
filling in all the blocks and a short pass for the Indicated classification.  Indium search parameters were 
particularly long (up to 300m) because of the limited amount of analytical data.   
 
MDA used the relationships presented in the limited Davis Tube data (640 samples) to convert estimated 
total iron into iron-in-magnetite and magnetite.  Because there are relatively few Davis Tube analyses 
and because the relationships between total iron and magnetite are not particularly well correlated, this 
imparts some lack of confidence in the total estimated amount of magnetite.  High iron grades generally 



              
                      Technical Report on the West Desert Project Preliminary Economic Assessment, Juab County, Utah

have a much stronger and better correlated relationship between iron and magnetite, mitigating the 
potential risk substantially. 
 
MDA classified the West Desert resource in order of increasing geological and quantitative confidence 
into Inferred and Indicated categories.  There are no Measured resources within the deposit, primarily 
due to complexity of the mineralization but also due to limited drill data.  The maximum distance 
criteria for Indicated within the Main Zone are less than that used for the Deep Zone due to the greater 
variability in domain morphology and metal grades.  There are substantially fewer indium analyses than 
the other metals, which has resulted in a downgrading of the resources to Inferred over a significant 
portion of the deposit.  None of these issues deter from the overall confidence in the global project 
resource, but they do detract from confidence in some of the accuracy which MDA believes is required 
for Measured and Indicated resources. 
 
This report assumes that all of the sulfide material would be mined by underground methods (this 
material includes copper-zinc-indium sulfides plus magnetite and is referred to as "sulfide" material in 
this report).  Near-surface oxide material would be mined by open-pit methods.  The stated resources are 
tabulated on a gross metal value ("GMV") in U. S. dollars using a cutoff grade of $15/tonne for open-pit 
oxide material, and $50/tonne for material mined by underground methods.  As multiple metals exist, 
but do not necessarily co-exist on a local scale, the GMV value is used for tabulation.  Using the 
individual metal grades of each block, the GMV grade is calculated using the following formula: 
 

GMV = (%Zn/100*2204.623) + (%Cu/100*2204.623*3.0) + (In ppm/1000*600.0) + 
(%Magnetite)/100*115.0) 

   
In addition to the individual metal tabulations and the average GMV value, the resource includes a zinc 
equivalent ("ZnEq") grade tabulation.  The ZnEq grade is calculated using the following formula: 
 

%ZnEq = %Zn+ (%Cu*3.0) + (In ppm* 0.027216) + (%Magnetite*0.052163) 
 
The GMV and ZnEq formulas are based on prices of $1.00 per pound zinc, $3.00 per pound copper, 
$600.00 per kilogram of indium, and $115/tonne of magnetite.  No metal recoveries are applied, as this 
is the in situ resource.  
 
A summary of the total combined West Desert resources is tabulated in Table 1.1.

Table 1.1 Summary of West Desert Resources 

 
 
West Desert is a polymetallic skarn deposit containing substantial Inferred and Indicated resources.  The 
detailed work completed by InZinc and MDA on the geologic model, and the data defining the model, 
have resulted in a resource estimate of high quality.  There is good potential to increase the size of the 
deposit by targeting extensions of mineralization primarily to the east, west, and south.  A higher 
classification above Inferred could be attained for a significant portion of the deposit with an increase in 
the number of indium sample assays.  Additional indium assays could also result in an increase in 
overall indium grade if the tenor of the new sample assays was similar to the existing assay data.  
 
The risk in the resource is mostly related to the deposit type.  Skarn deposits often present rapidly 
changing geometries, grades, and geology.  These geologic risks would mostly be alleviated through 
additional deposit-definition drilling.  There is some risk in the resource in the total iron to magnetite 
conversion due to the limited Davis Tube data, but this risk is mitigated by the relatively close 
correlation between high-grade iron and magnetite.  There should be sufficient sample reject material 
available from InZinc's 2007-2008 drilling program for selective additional Davis Tube analyses to 
complement the existing data set, if needed. 
 
1.8 Preliminary Economic Assessment

• Long-term metal prices of $1.00/lb zinc, $3.00/lb copper, $600/kg indium, $105/t iron 
concentrate (62% CFR Tianjin, China), $1300/oz gold, and $21/oz silver; 

• Average grade of magnetite of 63% attracting a $10/t premium to the iron price (net of $115/t for 
magnetite delivered to Tianjin, China); 

• Operation of a magnetic separator and flotation concentrator for the production of iron, zinc,    
and copper concentrates; 

• Near-surface oxide resources are not included in the PEA; 
• Construction of surface facilities to support the operation; and 
• Transportation of concentrates and supplies along the existing roads from the site to railways 

located within 90km of the site.  Iron concentrates are shipped form a western U. S. port and 
delivered into spot markets in China.  

 
Using the updated resource estimate, MDA generated an underground mine design and annualized 
mining schedule.  The mining schedule was used as the basis for a technical economic evaluation that 
incorporates estimates of potential mining revenue and costs.  
 
Note that a preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature.  It includes Inferred mineral 
resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied 
that would enable them to be classified as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary 
assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 
economic viability. 
 
1.8.1 Mining Methods 
 
Underground mining methods have been chosen for the West Desert project, based on the depth of 
potentially mineable mineralization and the selectivity that underground mining allows.  Sublevel 
stoping, using both long-hole and transverse mining methods have been utilized. 
 
Economic parameters have been established to estimate the potential value of the zinc, copper, indium, 
and magnetite in the resource model.  As this is a polymetallic deposit with value available from 
multiple metals, a Net Smelter Return ("NSR") value has been calculated for each resource block.  The 
NSR represents payment for concentrates sent off-site for further processing and refining.  The NSR 
considers the metallurgical recovery, metal prices, transportation and treatment costs, and penalties that 
the smelter may charge.  The NSR is also reduced based on a 1.5% royalty to arrive at the NSR value.  
Metal prices used to calculate the NSR are shown in Table 1.2. 
 

Table 1.2 NSR Metal Prices 

 
 

The project's iron concentrate is in the form of magnetite having 63% iron content.  It is projected to 
attract a $10/t premium to the 62% CFR Tianjin long-term benchmark iron ore price of $105/t.  Thus, an 
iron concentrate or magnetite price of $115/t is used in the economic analysis. 

Zinc 1.00$       $/lb

Copper 3.00$       $/lb

Indium 600.00$   $/kg

An NSR cutoff value, reflecting preliminary estimates of mining and processing costs, was assumed at 
$50/t for initial stope designs. 
 
Stope design was completed using Surpac© (version 6.6) software.  Sublevel long-hole stoping methods 
have been selected.  Long-hole stopes will be filled with cemented rock fill to provide ground support 
and control potential ground subsidence.  Detailed geotechnical and backfill studies have not been 
completed and will be required in the future.  
 
The PEA assumes that all material inside of the stope designs is processed and cannot be further 
separated into waste and ore.  The total dilution inside of the stope designs is approximately 20%.  Ore 
loss has been accounted for based on the stope designs.  The reported resource has been reduced both by 
the design and by the application of economic criteria.  In total, 68% of the Indicated and 49% of the 
Inferred resource (by tonnes) have been captured by the designed stopes.  No additional unplanned 
dilution or ore loss has been accounted for.   
 
A high-level study was completed to determine the best method for haulage of material from the 
underground to the surface.  Options considered included truck haulage, conveyor haulage, or shaft 
haulage.  For the purpose of this PEA, the conveying option has been selected.  
The development design assumes use of a primary decline for access, a single ventilation shaft for 
ventilation and egress, and a conveyor decline (with a conveyor hanging from the back) that can also be 
used for egress as required.  In addition, ore passes, ventilation raises, ramps connecting sublevels, and 
lateral development have been designed to allow access into and operation of the mine.  Designs also 
include equipment shops, warehouses, and a crusher station.   
 
MDA has used the basic development to determine a simplified ventilation network.  The ventilation 
parameters used are based on other similar projects of this size.  Since the mine will have a reduced 
number of trucks used for haulage due to the conveyor system, the ventilation requirements are reduced.  
Ventilation studies need to be advanced further at the next level of study. 
  
The bulk of the development access is in footwall dolomite zones assumed to have good strength.  
Additional costs have been added to the first 50m of each decline to account for support requirements 
near the portal.  The mineralized zones are assumed to have medium rock-strength characteristics.  
Estimated costs include cable bolting in the hanging wall to control dilution due to sloughing of waste 
from the hanging wall.  Geotechnical parameters will need to be confirmed with detailed rock-
mechanics studies at the next level of study 
 
The study assumes that minimal water is generated from underground workings and is pumped and re-
cycled to the process plant.  Due to the arid climate at West Desert, any additional water requirements 
for processing may need to be identified during detailed hydrology and water-balance studies working 
up to a pre-feasibility study. 
 
Table 1.3 shows the potentially mineable resources and includes the reported internal waste.  It should 
be noted that "potentially mineable resources" are not reserves and do not have demonstrated technical 
and economic viability.  Resources above cutoff are Indicated and Inferred blocks that are above a 
$50.00/t NSR cutoff within the designs.  Resources below cutoff are Indicated and Inferred blocks that 
are below a $50.00/t NSR cutoff but are reported as resources (above a GMV cutoff of $50.00/t).

Internal waste is material that is not classified as a resource and dilutes the total potentially mineable 
resources using zero grade and metal content. 
 

Table 1.3 PEA Potentially Mineable Resources and Dilution 

 
Equipment requirements were determined for development, production, and to support mining 
operations.  The PEA assumes that a contractor would complete the initial development in the pre-
production period.  Owner mining equipment would be purchased at the start of production.  The total 
life-of-mine equipment includes the initial equipment and the replacement equipment required every 
four to five years to maintain availability. 
 
The production schedule was created using MineSched© (version 8.0) mine-scheduling software.  The 
development and production schedules were integrated to ensure that the development requirements 
were met prior to production in any given area.   
 
The production schedule is based on a 5,000 tonnes per day rate or 1,825,000 tonnes per year for the 
first two years.  Once additional underground development is completed, production is expanded to 
6,500 tonnes per day or 2,372,000 tonnes per year.  Test stoping would be done during the pre-
production periods to prove up stoping techniques.  Primary production would not commence until 
development of the main decline, conveying decline, and ventilation shaft are complete and connection 
is made with a lateral to provide secondary egress.  At that time, production would start to build 
stockpiles on the surface and ramp up productivity. 
 
1.8.2 Recovery Methods 
 
All of the metallurgical test work completed on the West Desert materials indicate they will be amenable 
to processing using a conventional copper and zinc differential flotation process.  The process flowsheet 
will include crushing and grinding facilities to generate a magnetite plant feed with a nominal P80 of 65 
microns.  Magnetite will be recovered prior to flotation, and on average about 50 percent of the ore mass 
will be recovered as an iron concentrate (magnetite).  The tailings from the magnetite recovery process 
will be thickened and ground in order to ensure that target grinds in flotation are meeting the P80 target 
of 65 microns.

For ores with sufficient copper to operate an economic recovery process, zinc depressants will be added 
to the grinding mill to minimize zinc recovery to the copper rougher concentrate.  Copper rougher 
concentrate will be reground to 15 microns prior to three stages of copper cleaner flotation to produce a 
concentrate grading 29 percent copper. 
 
Tailings from the copper flotation circuit will be fed to the zinc flotation circuit.  CuSO4 will be added to 
the slurry to activate the zinc (sphalerite) for flotation.  Zinc rougher concentrate will be reground to 35 
microns prior to three stages of zinc cleaner flotation to produce a concentrate grading 55.0 percent zinc. 
 
Concentrates from the flotation process will be thickened and filtered to provide dry concentrates that 
will be shipped to the respective smelters. 
 
1.8.3 Project Infrastructure 
 
On-site project infrastructure will include a tailings facility, waste dumps, borrow pits, electrical 
distribution, access roads, and buildings.  Tailings storage facility ("TSF") designs rely on previous 
designs developed by Knight Piésold (Nilsson et al., 2010).   
 
Three waste dumps have been designed to provide storage of development waste.  Two of these are 
located near the portal entrances of the main and conveyor declines.  The third is located north of the 
conveyor decline. 
  
Aggregate from a borrow pit will be mined at surface, crushed, and delivered underground for backfill. 
A conceptual design, placing the borrow pit north of the main decline, provides approximately 20 
million tonnes of material.  At this time, the quality of this material is not known, and additional studies 
are required. 
 
Electrical power will be supplied underground, typically at 4,160V, using a ring system though the main 
and conveyor declines.  Power centers with step-down transformers will be located to provide power to 
drills, bolters, fans, and pumps in active mining areas and to fixed facilities, including the maintenance 
shop, crusher room, and warehouse. 
 
Various buildings will be constructed around the site.  Most of these would be pre-fabricated buildings, 
where applicable. The buildings would include: administration, safety and security, warehouse, mine 
and mill operations and dry facility, and a small office within the explosives storage facility.   
 
Primary access to the property is via the Brush Wellman Highway, which is a paved road originating in 
Delta, Utah.  This leads to a public gravel-surfaced road, which currently crosses the property between 
the TSF and the plant.  This portion of public access would be re-routed around the west side of the 
property, and a portion of the old public access would be used to access the site. 
 
The study includes the estimated costs of transporting three concentrates: magnetite, zinc, and copper.  
All concentrates would be loaded into over-the-road trucks on site.  Copper concentrate would be hauled 
directly to the Kennecott smelter in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Zinc and magnetite concentrates would be 
hauled by truck to an off-site rail load-out facility.  The off-site load-out facility will be located near 
Delta, Utah, although an alternative and equidistant site could be located near Wendover, Utah.  From

there, zinc concentrate would be loaded onto railcars for transport to the Teck smelter in Trail, B.C. 
Magnetite concentrate would be loaded onto railcars and delivered to a port facility near San Francisco, 
California (possibly Stockton, Richmond, or Oakland), from which it would be shipped to Tianjin, 
China. 
 
1.8.4 Environmental Studies and Permitting 
 
The West Desert deposit is located on undeveloped fee land, and although the property includes some 
peripheral federal lands and a state mineral lease, any development related to mining is expected to be 
located on existing fee land or lands converted to that status.  As a result, the majority of the regulatory 
requirements would be administered at the state level. 
 
InZinc currently holds exploration permits from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Utah 
Division of Oil, Gas and Mining as well as a Small Mine Permit from the latter agency.  No 
environmental studies were necessary for these permits, nor have any been carried out by InZinc on the 
project to this point. 
 
Since the project is at the level of a Preliminary Economic Assessment, the exact details of any further 
development have not been finalized.  However, the current study indicates that development activities 
may include underground mining, minor open pit mining, mineral processing facilities, a tailings 
facility, and water production from a groundwater source. 
 
InZinc retained Enviroscientists, Inc. of Reno, Nevada, to provide an independent assessment of the 
permits and approvals that would be required for continued exploration and any subsequent construction 
and operation of a mine at the West Desert project. Their report indicates that the following major 
environmental permits would be necessary from the state of Utah to construct and operate the project: 
 
1. Large Mine Operating Permit; 
2. Ground Water Discharge Permit; 
3. Pond Construction Permit; 
4. Dam Permit; 
5. Air Quality Permit, and 
6. Water Rights.  
 
Various environmental and cultural studies would be necessary to supply the baseline data required for 
these and other lesser permits. 
 
1.8.5 Capital Costs 
 
Capital cost estimates have been made for the mine, process plant, and facilities.  The total capital is 
summarized in Table 1.4.

1.8.6 Operating Costs 
 
Operating costs have been estimated for the life of the mine.  All operating costs prior to production in 
year one have been capitalized.  Total life-of-mine operating costs and cost per tonne are summarized in 
Table 1.5.   
 

Table 1.5 Operating Cost Estimate 

 
 
1.8.7 Economic Analysis 
 
This economic analysis includes operating and capital costs, revenues, and associated tax treatments 
based on an annual schedule.  This PEA has been developed to be NI 43-101 compliant.  Note that a 
preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature.  It includes Inferred mineral resources that 
are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied that would 
enable them to be classified as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment 
will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability. 
 
Key outcomes of this financial analysis indicate that the potentially minable resources support a 14.8 
year mine plan with production commencing at 5,500 tpd and increasing to 6500 tpd after year two of 
operations and sustained thereafter (Table 1.6).

1.9 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
This report provides an updated NI 43-101-compliant resource for the West Desert project that adds the 
magnetite resource to the previously reported (Nilsson et al., 2010) zinc-copper-indium resource.  The 
resource is supported by additional sampling and analysis of drill core by InZinc in 2013.  
 
West Desert is a polymetallic skarn deposit containing substantial Inferred and Indicated resources.  The 
deposit, the data defining the deposit, and the resulting resource estimate are considered high quality.  
However, skarn deposits often present rapidly changing geometries, grades, and geology.  These risks, 
imparted into the deposit and resource estimate, should be mitigated with continued deposit definition 
resulting from additional drilling.  
 
Indium is present in the West Desert deposit at unusually high levels.  However, not all historical 
operators of the project recognized this, and in some cases they did not assay their drill-core samples for 
indium.  Zinc, copper, and iron content was, on the other hand, easily recognized and is more common 
to all data sets.  Resource analysis is a function of data and their spatial distribution.  As such, the 
confidence level or classification of the West Desert resource is strongly influenced by the constituent 
with the fewest number of assays.  To counteract the current downgrade in classification due to the 
limited indium data, removing the indium from the current in situ resource has the potential to improve 
the amount of Indicated resources by up to 75% with a minimal (approximately 10%) reduction of the 
overall grades (on a GMV basis).  Therefore, two solutions are available to InZinc in the future.  These 
may include the removal of indium as a resource constituent or additional sampling to improve indium 
assay distribution.  Both solutions represent potentially positive improvements to the resource 
classification.    
  
This report also summarizes resources contained in the near-surface oxide portion of the West Desert 
deposit.  These resources have not been included in the economic analysis, and further metallurgical 
work to determine the viability of these resources is recommended.  
 
Magnetite mineralization is generally more extensive and continuous than the associated zinc and 
copper mineralization at West Desert.  The addition of magnetite does not increase the complexity or 
cost of mining the zinc and copper resources.  In fact, where magnetite co-exists with appreciable zinc 
and copper, it significantly increases the NSR value of the resource.  The combination of these factors 
positively impacts the "potentially mineable resources."  The underground mining designs applied in 
this study, including sub-level long-hole stoping, are based on limited geotechnical information.  MDA 
recommends detailed geotechnical studies to support these applications in advanced studies.   
 
Metallurgical results provide confidence in the ability to produce iron, copper, and zinc concentrates 
from the West Desert project materials.  Additional test work will be required to confirm and optimize 
the metallurgical process with more representative drill core from the project.  Future test work will 
need to provide a simulation of the entire proposed flowsheet, including the recovery of iron minerals 
prior to flotation, and to evaluate the impact of significantly reducing the flotation tonnage and the 
corresponding increase in flotation feed grades.  Key metallurgical parameters requiring additional work 
include primary grind optimization and copper flotation reagent conditions.  Iron, copper, and zinc 
concentrates have shown a consistent ability to be within standard market specifications for their 
respective markets.

In this study, potentially mineable resources (above cut-off) at West Desert comprise 7.86 million tonnes 
of Indicated and 20.56 million tonnes of Inferred material (undiluted).  Magnetite represents 
approximately 50% of this material.  The magnetic-separation process will recover approximately 97% 
of the magnetite as a high-quality iron concentrate.  The flotation feed tonnages are expected to be 
reduced by approximately 50 percent through the removal of magnetite, which will correspondingly 
double the zinc-copper grade of the flotation feed when compared to the mine production grades.  Based 
on the resource model, the grades of mine production should range from 6.7% to 2.7% zinc and 0.7% to 
0.3% copper over the 14.8 year production period.  
 
On a per tonne operating cost basis, the magnetite recovery process is expected to add approximately 
$0.75 to the baseline grinding, flotation, and dewatering costs for the project.  In comparison, the 
estimated cost to discard waste to the tailings storage facility is $0.25/tonne.  The process costs to 
produce all three concentrates are estimated at $12.23/tonne milled.  The incremental cost to produce 
magnetite is a fraction of the market value of magnetite concentrates and should make the option of 
producing a magnetite concentrate very attractive to the project.  These estimates demonstrate the 
efficiency and cost effectiveness of processing a magnetite concentrate and the resulting cost benefits of 
waste reduction at West Desert.    
 
West Desert has the potential to produce three concentrates.  In this study, zinc concentrates represent 
the highest value, containing approximately 1.6 billion pounds payable metal (with associated indium) 
over the life of the mine.  Copper concentrates are estimated to contain 147 million pounds of payable 
metal over the life of the mine.  Iron concentrates, at an estimated 63% iron grade, would total 
approximately 15 million tonnes over the life of the mine.  No deleterious elements are identified at 
penalty levels in the concentrates.  
  
Zinc and copper concentrates are produced at a large number of mines and treated at a variety of 
smelters and refineries around the world.  Global markets for iron concentrates were about 2.1 billion 
tonnes annually as of November 2012.  Market research suggests a trend towards higher demand for 
quality iron concentrates, particularly in China, as higher energy costs and new environmental policies 
are implemented.  MDA recommends marketing and transportation studies, including the development 
of potential domestic U. S. markets for the magnetite concentrates, be initiated at the next step of 
advancement.   The inclusion of a magnetite (iron) concentrate to the product stream adds significant 
volume and potential complexity to the transportation and marketing of products.  However, proximity 
to roads, power, rail, and the potential services/support and labor pool available in the nearby Salt Lake 
City area are important positive factors in this regard. 
 
At this level of study, the potential for a larger, multi-commodity revenue stream generated from the 
three concentrate products over an extended period (14.8 years in this study) is financially attractive.  
Currently, deposit complexity is highlighted as a potential risk.  MDA recommends additional drilling to 
improve deposit definition.  
 
Substantial underground resources at West Desert remain open for expansion to the east, west, and 
south.  There is also potential for the discovery of new zones beyond these extensions.   
 
West Desert is a project meriting substantial amounts of additional exploration and development work.

MDA recommends that InZinc undertake a two-phase approach to further develop the deposit: 
 
Phase One: 
 

1) resource expansion drilling and exploration drilling on the flanks of the deposit; 
2) infill drilling and sampling to upgrade resource classification (incorporating advanced 

metallurgical sampling and detailed geotechnical data collection); 
3) baseline environmental and hydrological studies; and 
4) a concentrate marketing and transportation study. 

 
The estimated budget for Phase One is $4.95 million. 
 
Phase Two: 
 

Advance to pre-feasibility study ("PFS") once maximum resource thresholds/classifications are 
achieved along with requisite metallurgical and geotechnical data.  Budgetary estimates for a PFS 
are dependent on the ultimate size of the deposit and any resulting changes in metal zonation or 
geometry.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
Mine Development Associates ("MDA") has prepared this technical report on the West Desert zinc-
copper-indium-magnetite project, located in Juab County, Utah, at the request of InZinc Mining Ltd., 
formerly called Lithic Resources Ltd. until the name was changed effective February 19, 2014; the 
company is referred to as "InZinc" in this report.  InZinc is a public company based in Vancouver, 
British Columbia, Canada, which trades on the TSX Venture Exchange.  The project was formerly 
called the Crypto project.  The West Desert property is held by InZinc through its U. S. subsidiary, 
N.P.R. (US), Inc. ("NPR").  
 
This report was written in compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the 
Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"), Companion Policy 43-
101CP, and Form 43-101F1.   
 
2.1 Project Scope and Terms of Reference 
 
The purpose of this report is to provide a technical summary containing an updated mineral resource 
estimate and an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") of the West Desert project.  Note 
that a preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature.  It includes Inferred mineral resources 
that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied that would 
enable them to be classified as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment 
will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability.   
 
This report has been prepared by Thomas L. Dyer, P.E., Senior Engineer for MDA; Paul Tietz, C. P. G., 
Senior Geologist for MDA; and Jeffrey B. Austin, P. Eng., President, International Metallurgical and 
Environmental Inc., who are qualified persons under NI 43-101.  Major contributions to the report have 
been made by Chris Staargaard, P.Geo., President of InZinc.  Mr. Staargaard is not independent of the 
issuer, and his contributions to the report were under the full supervision of Mr. Tietz and Mr. Dyer.  
The updated Mineral Resources were estimated and classified under the supervision of Mr. Tietz; no 
Mineral Reserves are estimated.  The PEA was prepared under the supervision of Mr. Dyer.  There is no 
affiliation between Messrs. Dyer, Tietz, or Austin and InZinc except that of an independent 
consultant/client relationship.   
 
The updated Mineral Resources reported herein for the West Desert project are reported to fulfill the 
requirements stipulated in NI 43-101.  Other resource estimates presented in Section 6.2 are reported for 
historic purposes only and do not necessarily meet the reporting requirements of NI 43-101.  MDA 
prepared a previous technical report on the West Desert project that included a mineral resource estimate 
for zinc, copper, and indium (Tietz et al., 2010).  No further drilling has been conducted since the 
effective date of that report, but the mineral resource estimate described in Section 14.0 of this report 
has been updated to include magnetite.  A previous PEA based on MDA's 2010 mineral resource 
estimate was prepared for InZinc (then Lithic Resources Ltd.) in 2010 by Nilsson et al. (2010).  The 
current PEA described in this report is based on the updated mineral resource estimate described herein. 
 
The scope of this study included a review of pertinent technical reports and data provided to MDA by 
InZinc relative to the general setting, geology, project history, exploration activities and results,

methodology, quality assurance, interpretations, drilling programs, and metallurgy.  MDA has relied on 
the data and information provided by InZinc for the completion of this report, including the supporting 
data for the estimation of the Mineral Resources.  In compiling the background information for this 
report, MDA relied on information provided by InZinc and on other references as cited in Section 27.0.   
 
The authors' mandate was to comment on substantive public or private documents and technical 
information listed in Section 27.0.  The mandate also required on-site inspections and the preparation of 
this independent technical report containing the authors' observations, conclusions, and 
recommendations.  Mr. Tietz, accompanied by Peter Ronning (consultant acting on MDA's behalf), 
conducted a site visit on March 26, 2008, which included a review of the drilling and sampling 
procedures.  Mr. Tietz conducted a second site visit June 9 through 13, 2008, during which the drilling 
results and project geology were reviewed with InZinc personnel.     
 
MDA has made such independent investigations as deemed necessary in the professional judgment of 
the authors to be able to reasonably present the conclusions discussed herein. 
 
The effective date of this report is March 17, 2014.  The effective date of the resource estimate is 
January 10, 2014.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
The authors are not experts in land, legal, environmental, and permitting matters.  The information 
presented in this Section 4.0 is based entirely on information provided to MDA by InZinc, including an 
independent report on land status and mineral rights prepared for InZinc by North American 
Exploration, Inc. (Gatten, 2014).  The land-status information in Section 4.2, the State of Utah mineral 
lease information in Section 4.3, and the permitting/environmental information in Section 4.4 are taken 
primarily from the Gatten (2014) report.  MDA presents this information to fulfill reporting 
requirements of NI 43-101 but expresses no opinion regarding the legal or environmental status of the 
West Desert property or any of the agreements and encumbrances related to the property. 
 
4.1 Location 
 
The West Desert property is located in western Juab County, west-central Utah, U.S.A., approximately 
160km southwest of Salt Lake City (Figure 4.1).  The project lies on the northwestern edge of the Fish 
Springs Range and includes the Fish Springs historic mining district. 
 
The property is located within the Fish Springs SW 7½' quadrangle and the Fish Springs 30' by 60' 
topographic map.  The project area lies about 4km south of the U. S. Air Force's Deseret Test Center.  
The Fish Springs Wilderness Study Area is adjacent to the southern boundary and southeast corner of 
the West Desert property (Figure 4.2).  Gatten (2014) noted that the Fish Springs National Wildlife 
Refuge is located about 5 to 6km east of the West Desert property on the opposite side of the range in an 
entirely different watershed and groundwater resource area.

4.2 Land Area 
 
The West Desert property consists of a single contiguous group of unpatented and patented lode mining 
claims and one Utah state mineral lease (Figure 4.3; Appendix A) situated in Sections 7, 9, and 16-21, 
Township 11 South, Range 14 West, and in Sections 12, 13, and 24, Township 11 South, Range 15 
West, Salt Lake Base Meridian.  All titles are held either in the name of Lithic Resources Ltd. (now 
called InZinc) or its U.S. subsidiary NPR.  InZinc reports that there is no record in their files of the 
property boundary and claims having been surveyed.  The property comprises 198 unpatented mining 
claims, all or part interest in 20 patented mining claims (private land), and one state mineral lease with 
an aggregate area of approximate1y 1,924ha, allowing for some overlap.  
 
The 198 unpatented claims, which comprise approximately 1,553ha, are located on public land 
administered by the U. S. Bureau of Land Management ("BLM").  They are the 40 Crypto Zn, 63 
Crypto, and 95 Pony claims.  Unpatented claims can be held indefinitely and require an annual 
maintenance fee of $140 to be paid to the BLM each year on September 1 in order to remain in good 
standing.  Gatten (2014) reported that the annual maintenance fees for the 198 unpatented claims have 
been paid for the 2012-2013 year, that the claims are valid until September 1, 2014,  and that the claims 
are considered "active" and in good standing by the BLM.  InZinc purchased 40 of the unpatented 
claims as part of the original land package they acquired and staked the remaining 158 claims 
themselves. 
 
The 20 patented claims, which include both surface and mineral rights, are now considered private or fee 
land and as such are administered by the state of Utah.  These 20 patented claims comprise 133.7ha in 
the core of the historic mining district.  Through NPR, who is the owner of record, InZinc has 100% 
interest in 15 of the patented claims and a part interest in the five additional patented claims (Appendix 
A) (Gatten, 2014).  According to InZinc, the patented claims may require varying but generally nominal 
annual property tax payments due in November of each year.  InZinc represents that the annual property 
tax payments for the patented claims have been paid for the current year. 
 
The Utah state mineral lease ML 48312, which comprises 247ha, is administered by the state of Utah 
School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration ("SITLA").  NPR entered into the lease June 16, 
1999 (Gatten, 2014).  Leases are typically for 10 years initially, during which time they require an 
annual payment of $1 per acre due on July 1 of each year to remain in good standing.  Following the 
initial 10-year period, the leaseholder may apply to extend the lease for another 10-year period based on 
evidence that significant work has been done to develop the property.  Extended leases are subject to 
minimum advance royalties of $3 per acre per year in addition to the annual lease payment of $1 per 
acre per year.  Mineral production or processing on state leases is subject to payments of royalties as 
summarized in Section 4.3.  The state lease that is part of the West Desert property was due to expire 
July 1, 2009, but InZinc applied for and was granted an extension for an additional 10 years.  The new 
lease requires advance royalty payments of $3 per acre per year in addition to the standard fee of $1 per 
acre per year; the total annual cost to hold this lease is now $2,448.  Gatten (2014) reported that "all 
payments are current and the lease is active.  The terms of the lease extend to June 30, 2019, but can be 
extended further if a mine is in production." 
 
Gatten (2014) opined that "this work confirms that the property is as represented and that InZinc 
Mining, Ltd. and N.P.R. (US), Inc. [are] the owner.  The unpatented mining claims are valid and in good

order.  The Exploration and Small Mine permit[s] are also in good standing and are valid through June, 
2014.  The patented mining claims are owned by N.P.R. (US), Inc. and the state metalliferous minerals 
lease is also held by N.P.R. (US), Inc." 
 
The holding costs of the West Desert property in 2014 are estimated by InZinc at about $30,600. 
 
Within or impinging on the West Desert property boundary, there are 11 full and partial claims held by 
other parties as shown on Figure 4.3. 
 
4.3 Agreements and Encumbrances 
 
The information in this section has been provided by InZinc or has been taken from Gatten (2014).    
 
The West Desert property is subject to a 1.5% Net Smelter Return ("NSR") royalty interest on all 
production payable to BCKP Limited ("BCKP"); on June 29, 2012, BCKP acquired beneficial 
ownership of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Vaaldiam Mining Inc. (formerly Vaaldiam 
Resources Ltd.; Vaaldiam Mining Inc. news release, June 20, 2012), which was the successor company 
to Noble Peak Resources Ltd., a previous owner of the property.  BCKP is also entitled to receive a one-
time cash payment of C$1,000,000 upon InZinc's securing financing to bring the West Desert property 
into production.   
 
The state mineral lease carries a Gross Smelter Return ("GSR") royalty of 8% for fissionable 
metalliferous materials and 4% for non-fissionable metalliferous minerals, payable to SITLA and based 
on any ores produced from the leased lands and sold by the lessee (Gatten, 2014).  None of the current 
resource is contained within the leased state lands.

4.4 Environmental Permits and Potential Liabilities 
 
4.4.1 Permits 
 
The following information on the status of permits is taken directly from the land report by Gatten 
(2014) with minor editorial changes to conform to the style of this report and with a summary table and 
figure added by InZinc. 
 
Certain permits are required by the State of Utah to explore for minerals and conduct mining operations.  
These are administered by the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining ("DOGM") and the BLM and 
include exploration, small mine (less than five acres disturbance), and large mine permits.  In addition to 
DOGM regulation, the BLM also monitors field and reclamation activities conducted on federal lands. 
 
NPR currently holds four permits in regards to the exploration and mine development of the West Desert 
property.  These permits are:

4.4.2 Potential Liabilities 
 
According to Gatten (2014), environmental liabilities on the West Desert property are limited to the 
reclamation of areas disturbed by InZinc's exploration activities.  A long history of mining and

exploration on and around the property prior to InZinc's purchase of the property in 2005 is evidenced 
by the presence of numerous mine workings including shafts, adits, and pits as well as waste dumps and 
debris from historic mining activities and settlements associated with those activities.  Responsibilities 
in such areas of historical mining are governed by The Utah Code under Title 40 "Mines and Mining", 
and Chapter 8 the "Utah Mined Land Reclamation Act", which was enacted in 1975.  Section 4 of 
Chapter 8 states that: 
 

"lands not subject to reclamation ("Lands Affected") by a current Operator are defined in (13) 
(b) as "all lands shall be excluded .....that would (i) "be includeable as land affected, but which 
have been reclaimed in accordance with an approved plan, as may be approved by the board" 
and (ii) "lands in which mining operations have ceased prior to July 1, 1977". 

 
The last recorded mining activity on the West Desert property dates from the 1950s.  Based on The Utah 
Code, all of the historical workings in the project area are considered "lands not subject to reclamation," 
as these operations all predate July 1, 1977.  Accordingly, they are not included in any reclamation work 
required to be performed by InZinc on the West Desert property (Gatten, 2014).  However, InZinc's 
exploration activities have avoided and will continue to avoid or mitigate any impacts in accordance 
with applicable permits and regulations.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
5.1 Access 
 
The West Desert property is located approximately 160km southwest of Salt Lake City and can be 
accessed from that direction via state route 36, from which the Pony Express Road and other county-
maintained gravel roads lead to the property.  The property is located 125km northwest of Delta, Utah, 
and can be also accessed from that direction via the paved Brush Wellman Road and other county-
maintained gravel roads.  Numerous old drill and mining roads provide excellent access to most of the 
property. 
 
5.2 Climate 
 
Climatic conditions on the property are those of the arid desert, typical of the Great Basin area in 
Nevada and Utah.  Average daytime temperatures range from 33ºC in July to 1ºC in January, with 
pronounced temperature variations between night and day.  In general, precipitation does not exceed 
15cm per year and occurs mainly as afternoon cloudbursts during the summer and as snowfall between 
October and May.  
 
Surface exploration can be carried out year-round on the property, although winter storms can 
occasionally deposit enough snow to limit access for a few days at a time.  Mining could be carried out 
year-round. 
 
5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
The nearest significant supply point is Delta, located approximately 125 road-km southeast of the 
property, which has a population of about 3,200.  The state capitol, Salt Lake City, and surrounding Salt 
Lake County, with a population of 1.2 million, is about 160km northeast of the property.  InZinc 
established a small trailer camp on the property during its exploration program, as did previous property 
owners.  Various ranchers in the area have heavy equipment such as bulldozers and excavators available 
for contract work, and unskilled labor is available in local settlements.  
 
The nearest rail line runs through Delta; another runs parallel to Interstate Highway 80 north of the 
property and can be accessed at the town of Wendover, Utah, approximately 120km north-northwest of 
the property.  The closest air strip with the capacity to land small fixed-wing aircraft is located at the 
small ranching community of Granite Ranch, approximately 25km southwest of the property.  
 
A single-phase 14kV electrical transmission line owned by the Mt. Wheeler Power cooperative in Ely, 
Nevada, crosses the West Desert property from the west, and three-phase electrical power is available at 
the ranching community of Callao about 20km to the west.  A 1.8 gW coal-fired generating station 
owned by Intermountain Power is located immediately northwest of Delta and supplies Mt. Wheeler 
Power through a 230kV transmission line passing south of the property at a distance of about 70km.  
PacifiCorp's 525 mW Currant Creek natural-gas-fired generating plant is located at Mona, 90km 
directly east of the West Desert property.

There is no surface water on the property.  An old water well established in the 1960s was used for 
exploration drill water at the time.  Subsequent exploration campaigns either supplemented this source 
with or relied on water purchased from landowners in Callao or Granite Ranch and trucked to the site.  
InZinc currently has water rights on the property and has re-furbished two existing water wells for future 
use. 
 
5.4 Physiography 
 
The West Desert property lies on the southern margin of the Great Salt Lake Desert and on the 
northwestern pediment slope of the Fish Springs Range, one of the generally north-trending mountain 
ranges of the Basin and Range physiographic province that covers western Utah and most of the state of 
Nevada.  The Fish Springs Range is about 5km wide by 30km long and is 1,830m in elevation at its 
crest.  The West Desert property includes flat valley floor at an elevation of about 1,200m on the west 
side of the property, which slopes up to fairly rugged cliffs and ridges with a maximum elevation of 
about 1,800m on the eastern side of the property.  To date, work has concentrated on and around a minor 
east-west-trending spur extending west from the main range, at elevations of between 1,300 and 1,500m 
above sea level ("ASL"). 
 
Vegetation is typified by scattered low brush and grassy patches with intervening areas of bare ground. 
Mainly desert species are dominated by various grasses, sagebrush, greasewood, rabbit brush, shadscale, 
blackbrush, mormon tea, leadbush, and prickly pear cactus.  The principal bird and animal species 
observed in the property area include various songbirds, rodents, jackrabbits, lizards, and snakes, while 
coyotes, deer, owls, and raptors are reported to have been seen elsewhere in the Fish Springs Range.  
Local ranchers occasionally run cattle in the area seasonally, but a lack of water precludes maintaining 
any livestock on a continuing basis. 
 
Figure 5.1 shows the northern end of the Fish Springs Range.  The West Desert resource is located at the 
foot of the mountains within the center of the image.

6.0 HISTORY 
 
6.1 Exploration History 
 
The following information has been taken from a summary of the project's history apparently compiled 
by staff of Utah International in late 1973, from information provided by InZinc, and from additional 
sources as cited. 
 
Silver-lead mineralization was discovered in the area of the present day West Desert property in 1890 by 
C. C. Van Alstine, and the Fish Springs mining district was organized the following year (U.S.G.S. 
Mineral Resource Data System).  Between 1890 and 1953, high-grade lead-silver ores were mined from 
oxidized, carbonate replacement deposits in small underground operations, mainly the Utah and Galena 
mines and to a much lesser extent, the Emma, Vulcan, Last Chance, and Meteor mines.  The total 
production from the Fish Springs district between 1890 and 1953 is recorded at 7,850,929kg of lead, 
1,271kg of zinc, 2,436kg of copper, 508 ounces of gold, and 2,658,220 ounces of silver from 18,415 
tonnes of ore (Perry and McCarthy, 1976). 
 
In 1953, Professor M. L. Jensen of Yale University, working for Kennecott Copper Corporation 
("Kennecott," which for this report also includes Bear Creek Mining Company, Kennecott's U.S. 
exploration subsidiary), conducted a ground-magnetometer survey over the district, which revealed a 
strong magnetic high over the present property area.  The survey was conducted with a portable 
Schmidt-type vertical-intensity magnetometer as part of a program of vehicle magnetics along county 
roads in Utah.  Kennecott conducted grid magnetics and geologic mapping in the summer of 1954.  In 
March 1955, Jensen recommended that Kennecott acquire the property; in March 1957, Frank Howd 
staked 35 claims in his name but on behalf of Kennecott.  Between 1953 and 1957, Kennecott completed 
ground gravimetric, induced polarization ("IP"), and magnetic surveys as well as geochemical sampling 
and geologic mapping on the property.  Kennecott dropped the claims in 1958.  Kennecott's holdings 
did not include the Utah mine, which was owned by the LDS church through the Utah Mine Company, 
who had leased it to a John Fritch in 1953 in a 20-year lease-purchase option.  
 
Upon learning that Kennecott was going to drop their claims and with Kennecott's permission, Jensen 
and M. P. Erickson re-staked the ground as the Crypto claims in the summer of 1958 on behalf of 
Pinnacle Exploration Inc. ("Pinnacle"), a subsidiary of Callahan Mining Corp.  Robert Keeny, on behalf 
of former Kennecott employee Spenster M. Hansen, also located Golden Boy claims on the same ground 
at about the same time.  At some point in 1958 or 1959, Pinnacle also completed a lease-purchase 
agreement with Fritch, the leaseholder of the Utah mine property.  Pinnacle added new claims to the 
property in 1958 and 1959.  Kennecott quitclaimed all rights to all Crypto claims to Jensen and Pinnacle 
in August 1958, apparently to circumvent the problem with the potentially conflicting claims of Spenster 
Hansen, according to the Utah International summary.   
 
In July and August of 1958, Pinnacle conducted heavy-metal geochemical sampling, geological 
mapping, and a VLF-EM geophysical survey on the West Desert property.  The heavy-metal 
geochemical sampling was not considered helpful, but the geophysical survey did identify several 
clustered EM conductors.  According to the Utah International summary, Hansen probably drilled two 
holes, perhaps rotary holes, also in the summer of 1958, but there is no record of where they were 
located or the results of the drilling.  In the summer of 1959, Pinnacle drilled two core holes totaling

228.6m (C-1, C-2).  According to the Utah International summary, Pinnacle's holes eliminated an EM 
anomaly; although no magnetite was encountered, some iron oxide zones assayed weak Pb, Cu, and Ag.  
 
In August 1961, Utah Construction & Mining ("Utah"), a predecessor company to Utah International 
Inc. (also referenced further as "Utah"), leased the Crypto claims and the Utah mine lease from 
Pinnacle, after carrying out a ground-magnetic survey with an Askania magnetometer to test the 
property's potential to host an economic magnetite deposit.  There was no prior connection between 
Utah International and the Utah mine located on the property.  In 1965, after Pinnacle defaulted on its 
agreement with John Fritch, Utah made a new and separate lease-purchase option agreement with Fritch 
for the Utah mine property.  In 1967, Pinnacle's interest in the Crypto claims and the Utah mine lease 
was quitclaimed to Utah.  In 1973 following considerable legal argument, the Utah Mine Co. conveyed 
ownership of the Utah mine to Fritch, who then immediately transferred it to Utah.  Between 1961 and 
1985, Utah completed various geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys, including detailed 
ground magnetics and IP-resistivity.  In addition, Utah drilled 39 core holes totaling 16,555.8m and 
eight reverse circulation ("RC") holes totaling 609.5m.  The Main Zone sulfide zinc and oxide deposits 
were discovered during this time.  In addition to their surface work, Utah also carried out underground 
mapping and sampling on two levels of the historic Utah mine (Shaw and O'Toole, 1975; Shaw, 1979; 
Hehn, 1979-1983).   
 
Noble Peak Resources Ltd. ("Noble Peak") purchased the property from Utah in 1985 and compiled the 
existing drill-hole data, carried out a small soil and rock geochemical survey, and sampled the old drill 
core and mine dumps for their potential to support a silver-leaching operation. 
 
In 1990, a joint venture between Cyprus Minerals Company ("Cyprus") and Mitsui Mining & Smelting 
Co. Ltd. ("Mitsui") obtained an option to earn a 50% interest in the property from Noble Peak.  In the 
second half of 1990, Cyprus completed 15.3 line-km of gradient-array IP-resistivity and 3.2 line-km of 
dipole-dipole IP surveying along with surface geological mapping.  The gradient-array IP-resistivity 
survey was conducted by Great Basin Geophysical with a line spacing of 122m and a dipole spacing of 
61m.  It located the main West Desert anomaly, its continuation to the east toward and under the Galena 
and Utah mines, and a new doughnut-shaped anomaly in the northeastern quadrant of the survey area 
(Cyprus/Mitsui Joint Venture Geologists, 1990).  The dipole-dipole IP survey confirmed the presence of 
most of the major IP anomalies from the gradient survey.  Cyprus re-logged 7,620m of Utah's diamond 
drill core and constructed detailed geological cross-sections.  By the end of 1991, Cyprus had completed 
17 diamond drill holes totaling 9,434.6m and two RC holes totaling 670.6m (Cyprus/Mitsui Joint 
Venture Geologists, 1990; Bernardi and Ohlin, 1991a, 1991b).  Two of the diamond core holes (CCC-
6B and CCC-10A) were wedges off existing holes that were discontinued due to significant down-hole 
deviation.  Among other things, this drilling confirmed the presence of and expanded the Deep Zone.  
Mitsui left the joint venture in 1991.  Also in 1991, after completing 14 of the diamond drill holes 
(CCC-1 to CCC-12, including the two wedge holes) and the two RC holes (RCCC-1 and RCCC-2), 
Cyprus completed a "pre-feasibility study" based on a preliminary resource estimate and some bench-
scale metallurgical test work on both the oxide and sulfide mineralization; their metallurgical testing is 
described in Section 13.0.  They subsequently drilled an additional three core holes (CCC-13 to CCC-
15) into the Deep Zone and extended known mineralization.  Cyprus dropped their option on the 
property from Noble Peak in 1993.

In 1994, Noble Peak carried out a small prospecting and surface-rock-geochemical program to 
investigate the possibility of zone(s) of gold enrichment.  According to InZinc, at some point between 
1993 and 1996 the original unpatented Crypto claims were allowed to lapse; in March 1996, North 
American Exploration staked 54 Crypto Zn claims on behalf of Noble Peak, 40 of which have remained 
active and are part of the current property.  In 1998, Noble Peak changed its name to Vaaldiam 
Resources Ltd. ("Vaaldiam"), began to concentrate on diamond exploration, and optioned the property 
to Sierra Gigantes Resources Inc. ("Sierra").  Sierra carried out an "enzyme leach" soil-sampling survey 
prior to dropping their option due to financing difficulties. 
 
EuroZinc Mining Corporation ("EuroZinc") purchased the West Desert property from Vaaldiam in 2001 
by purchasing a 100% equity interest in N.P.R. (US), Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned 
subsidiary of Vaaldiam whose sole asset was the mineral title to the West Desert property.  Other than 
compiling some of the historic results in a computer database, EuroZinc did not conduct any work 
during their tenure. 
 
InZinc purchased N.P.R. (US), Inc. from EuroZinc in 2005, thereby acquiring the West Desert property.  
At the time of InZinc's purchase, the property included 40 unpatented mining claims (the Crypto Zn 
claims in Appendix A), partial or complete interest in 17 patented claims, and the state mineral lease, all 
of which were held in the name of NPR.  Since then, InZinc has staked an additional 158 claims (the 
Crypto and Pony claims) and purchased interests in three more patented claims.  InZinc's exploration is 
described in Section 9.0, and the list of claims and the lease that comprise the property is in Appendix A.        
 
6.2 Historic Mineral Resource Estimates 
 
A number of historic resource estimates for the West Desert project have been made by various parties 
over the years and are summarized below.  Where tonnages were originally reported in Imperial units, 
they have been converted to metric based on conversion factors listed in Section 2.2.  The following 
information on these historic estimates is presented for historic information only and in the interest of 
full disclosure.  The reader is cautioned that these historic resource estimates were made prior to the 
implementation of NI 43-101 reporting requirements, do not conform to those requirements, and should 
not be relied on as being indicative of a resource or a reserve with demonstrated economic viability.  
Where terms later defined in NI 43-101 were used in the historic record, such terms have been enclosed 
in quotation marks.  The authors have not done sufficient work to classify these historic estimates as 
current mineral resources or mineral reserves, and InZinc is not treating these historic estimates as 
current estimates.  These historic mineral resource estimates are superseded by the current mineral 
resource estimate described in Section 14.0. 
 
6.2.1 1976 Estimate by Utah International Inc. 
 
In 1976, Utah used a sectional approach to estimate what they termed a "proved resource" (Gorman and 
Jones, 1981).  All of the mineralization included would be located in what is now termed the Main Zone 
between depths of 15 and 500m below surface.  Fifteen separate zones involving four types of 
mineralization were outlined based on a 3.05m mining width and a minimum recovered metal value (Zn, 
Ag, Cu) of $35/ton.  Metal prices were current as of 1975, and estimated mill-recovery factors were 95% 
for sphalerite, 70% for sulfide-oxide material, and 50% for other minerals.  Mill-recovery cutoff was 1% 
for Zn.  Zinc mineralization was considered "oxide ore" if the ZnO/Zn ratio was greater than 0.1.

"Protore" was defined as material comprising the "transition between barren and sulfide/oxide ore."  
Zones were geologically constrained by dikes and faults.  Table 6.1 summarizes their estimate.

6.2.2 1991 and 1993 Historic "Geological Reserve" Estimate by Cyprus Minerals Company 
 
Cyprus made a number of estimates of "geologic reserves" during their tenure on the property.  In late 
1990 after drilling the first three of their core holes, Cyprus estimated that the "geologic underground 
zinc sulfide reserves" at West Desert were 3.75 million tonnes grading 7.87% Zn (at a 2% Zn cutoff), 
0.234% Pb, and 0.117 oz Ag/ton (Cyprus/Mitsui Joint Venture Geologists, 1990).  This estimate was 
based on review of all available assay and geologic sections as well as plan-level maps that had been 
generated by prior operators combined with the results of their own early drilling.  Open-pit oxide 
"reserves," which were based solely on the work of prior operators, were estimated to be 2.8 million 
tonnes averaging 7% Zn (Cyprus/Mitsui Joint Venture Geologists, 1990).  Cyprus continued to update 
the "reserves" as they completed successive phases of drilling (Bernardi and Ohlin, 1991a, 1991b). 
 
Cyprus estimated a "geological reserve" at West Desert using a cross-sectional method; details are given 
in Cyprus/Mitsui Joint Venture Geologists (1990).  Sections were spaced at distances of 61.0 to 91.4m, 
and blocks were extended along section halfway between drill intercepts or to a maximum of 91.4m up 
or down dip in cases where no other drill intercepts were present.  Blocks were then extended between 
sections to either half the distance to the adjacent section or to a maximum of 45.7m at the limit of 
drilling.  Blocks were also constrained by geological features such as faults and dikes.  Criteria used in 
the estimation were a cutoff grade of 2% Zn and a density factor of 9 cubic ft/ton (3.56 g/cm3).  No other 
elements were included. 
 
Following the first part of their Phase III drilling in 1991, Cyprus re-calculated the "underground sulfide 
zinc reserves" for West Desert (Bernardi and Ohlin, 1991b).  This 1991 "geological reserve," which was 
described in summary and commented on by Roscoe Postle and Associates in early 1993 (Agnerian, 
1993), incorporated mineralization in both the Main and Deep zones based on 25 core holes that 
intersected mineralized zones but did not include significant zinc mineralization encountered in three of 
the last four core holes drilled later in 1991 by Cyprus to test extensions of the Deep Zone.  Drill-hole 
spacing of the 25 holes used was 91 to 152m (Agnerian, 1993).  Subsequently in 1993, it appears that 
Cyprus re-estimated the resource and included the results of the three additional holes (Rockingham, 
2001).  Both estimates are summarized in Table 6.2.

6.2.3 1995 Historic "Geological Resource" Estimate by Noble Peak Resources Ltd. 
 
In 1995, Noble Peak commissioned an independent estimate from B. Henderson, who used a sectional 
approach to calculate a "geological resource" (Henderson, 1995).  Blocks were defined on section for 
every drilled interval grading better than 2% zinc, ultimately including 34 drill holes.  Blocks were 
extended halfway to adjacent drill holes along section or, if no other holes were present within 91.4m, to 
a maximum of 45.7m.  These blocks were categorized as "probable."  "Possible" blocks were added to 
the sections along which no drill information was available but where from adjacent sections it appeared 
likely that a zone of mineralization would occur.  The dimensions of the "possible" blocks were 
proportional to those of the adjacent "probable" block, and the grades were the same.  The blocks were 
then extended laterally to halfway between sections except where a dike or fault was present, in which 
case the block was terminated.  An effort was made to group blocks into zones and/or "lenses" of 
mineralization, resulting in 20 lenses in eight zones. 
 
According to Tindale (1997), "Henderson's reserve calculations expanded on the Cyprus calculations to 
include isolated intercepts in the Utah and Cyprus holes which in most cases could not be directly 
correlateable to assumed zones of mineralization."  He further noted that "…Henderson's calculations 
do highlight the great quantity of zinc mineralization present in the Crypto deposit…" 
 
Cumulative tonnage and grade figures were calculated for all blocks assigned grades of over 2% Zn and 
then for all blocks assigned grades of over 4% Zn.  The results of these calculations are summarized by 
"category" and also in terms of sulfide vs. oxide mineralization in Table 6.3.

6.3 Previous Mineral Resource Estimate 
 
MDA prepared the first mineral resource estimate of the West Desert project meeting NI 43-101 
reporting standards, which was described in a 2010 technical report (Tietz et al., 2010).  This estimate 
included zinc, copper, and indium, but not magnetite.  The updated estimate described in Section 14.0 
includes magnetite.

7.0 GEOLOGIC SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
7.1 Geologic Setting 
 
7.1.1 Regional Geology 
 
The following information on the regional geology is largely taken from Stokes (1986). 
 
The West Desert property is located on the northwestern edge of the Fish Springs Range, which is in 
turn located in the northeastern part of the Basin and Range Province of the southwestern United States 
(Figure 7.1).  The Basin and Range physiographic province is characterized by generally north-trending 
fault-bounded mountain ranges and intervening basins that formed during regional Tertiary extension.  
The province is bounded on the east by Utah's Wasatch Range lying just east of Salt Lake City and on 
the west by the Sierra Nevada in eastern California.

From Cambrian through Early Triassic time, western Utah was the site of marine deposition of shelf 
deposits in the Cordilleran geosyncline.  East-directed Paleozoic compressional deformation that 
affected central and northeastern Nevada did not reach into west-central Utah.  Mesozoic sedimentary 
rocks younger than the Early Triassic are only rarely exposed in western Utah, which appears to have 
been part of a poorly defined highlands area extending into Nevada at that time.  The first intrusive 
igneous activity in western Utah since the Precambrian is marked by Jurassic intrusions with dates 
ranging from 140 to 152 Ma in the House Range, Silver Island Mountains, Gold Hill area, and 
Newfoundland Mountains that are unusual in being located in an extensive sedimentary basin.  Late 
Cretaceous to early Tertiary folding, thrust faulting, and uplift of the Sevier and Laramide orogenies 
affected central and northeastern Utah but in western Utah have only limited exposures, e.g. Deep Creek 
Range near the Nevada border.  Intermediate volcanic and intrusive activity was widespread in Utah 
during the middle Tertiary with exposures of these units in the ranges to the east and west of the Fish 
Springs Range.  Intrusive rocks presumed to be Late Eocene in age found in the Fish Springs Range may 
be early examples of this igneous activity.  A separate and distinct volcanic center was located in the 
approximate center of Juab County with exposures in Desert Mountain, Key Mountain, and the Thomas 
Range.  Less extensive mafic volcanism also occurred during the late Cenozoic in western Utah.  
 
7.1.2 Local Geology 
 
Generally speaking, the Fish Springs Range is a north-trending horst comprised of lower Cambrian to 
upper Devonian platformal sedimentary rocks that have been homoclinally tilted to the west at generally 
moderate dips (Hintze, 1980; Lindsey et al., 1989) (Figure 7.2).  The sedimentary package, which 
exceeds 3,500m in total thickness, consists mainly of carbonate rocks, with minor interbedded shales 
and quartzites.  Scattered quartz monzonite intrusive complexes and rhyolite dikes and occasional 
andesitic plugs intrude the sedimentary rocks locally and are presumed to be Late Eocene age.  Tertiary 
volcanic rocks of latitic, shoshonitic, and rhyodacitic composition are found along with younger 
alluvium in basins adjoining the Fish Springs Range. 
 
The general structure of the Fish Springs Range is relatively simple, the dominant element being a series 
of northerly trending extensional faults related to the development of the Basin and Range Province.  
Most are normal with west-side down and small to moderate displacements.  Other than the Juab fault 
described below, faulting and/or folding are of minor significance within the northern end of the Fish 
Springs Range as evidenced by regional mapping to date.

7.1.3 Property Geology 
 
The following description of the West Desert property geology is synthesized from various Utah (Hehn, 
1979-1983; Shaw, 1979; Shaw and O'Toole, 1975) and Cyprus (Cyprus/Mitsui Joint Venture 
Geologists, 1990; Bernardi and Ohlin, 1991a, 1991b) reports, together with observations and 
interpretation by InZinc personnel and consultants.  The property is predominately underlain by a 
sequence of lower Cambrian to upper Devonian platformal carbonate units, mainly dolostones with 
lesser, generally thin-bedded limestones and minor interbedded quartzites and shales (Figure 7.3 and 
Figure 7.4).  From youngest to oldest, the stratified rocks include the following divisions:

Figure 7.4 Geologic Map of the West Desert Zinc Property 
(Provided by InZinc Mining Ltd., 2014) 

 
 
Outcrop mapping and observations by InZinc geologists coupled with mapping and core logging by 
Utah and Cyprus geologists indicate that where exposed at the surface, the sedimentary rocks strike 
northerly and have a shallow to moderate westerly dip.  In some places, minor northerly trending folds 
result in a degree of flattening or even dip reversals to the east. 
 
A number of faults have been mapped or are postulated to exist on the property, the most obvious being 
the Juab fault, a west-northwest-trending, north-dipping normal fault that trends through the middle of 
the property.  The fault is significant enough to have caused an apparent left-lateral offset of the Fish 
Springs Range and is thought to have on the order of 500-600m of net vertical displacement, although 
no discrete planar feature has been identified in core and post-intrusion thermal healing of the structure 
is evident.  The north-trending Overland fault along the western margin of the Fish Spring Range, 
together with a number of lesser sub-parallel faults, are normal with west-side down and represent 
extensional faulting typical of the Basin and Range Province.  Various other lesser faults with varying 
orientations have been interpreted on the property in the past, but the evidence for them is not as clear.

Drilling has revealed that the sedimentary package has been intruded by a Late Eocene (38.5 ±1.0 Ma, 
K/Ar) felsic intrusive complex which underlies a large part of the property at depth but is not exposed at 
the surface.  In the vicinity of the West Desert deposit, it rises to the bedrock surface in a cupola which 
sub-crops below shallow Pleistocene gravels.  Two main phases have been identified so far: a grey, 
medium-grained, equigranular to weakly porphyritic biotite quartz monzonite and a pinkish buff, 
medium-grained, equigranular biotite quartz syenite.  
 
Various dikes ranging in composition from porphyritic quartz trachyte to rhyolite are exposed in outcrop 
or have been observed in drill core and are thought by InZinc geologists to be related to the same 
intrusive event as the quartz monzonite.  The most obvious is the so-called Utah dike, which averages 
about 15m in width at the surface and can be traced for over a kilometer easterly from the West Desert 
deposit through the area of the Utah mine.  Other east-trending dikes of similar composition, some up to 
30m wide, have been intersected in drilling. 
 
Thin-bedded carbonate rocks near the intrusive complex, particularly those with shaly partings, have 
been altered to skarn, marble, and siliceous hornfels.  More thickly bedded to massive dolostones tend to 
be converted to marble.  Although dips are shallow to moderate where observed in outcrop, drilling has 
shown that bedding attitudes in the immediate vicinity of the intrusion have been disrupted such that 
they can have very steep dips.  This has probably resulted from stoping and doming by the intrusion, 
although drag on the Juab fault may also have been a factor.  Thin-bedded limestones of the Orr 
Formation immediately south of the Juab fault have been folded at depth such that dips near the fault are 
close to vertical. 
 
Zinc-copper-indium-iron mineralization of the West Desert deposit occurs in portions of the skarn, while 
molybdenite mineralization occurs both as disseminations in the skarn and in more classic, porphyry-
style quartz-pyrite veinlets superimposed on the quartz monzonite intrusion.  High-grade lead-zinc-silver 
mineralization, including that exploited in the historic Utah and Emma mines, occurs in structurally 
controlled replacement zones in carbonate rocks peripheral to skarn. 
 
The western half of the West Desert property is mostly overlain by Pleistocene lacustrine deposits from 
glacial Lake Bonneville, which show wave-cut terraces at a number of levels where they lap against the 
Fish Springs Range. 
 
7.2 Mineralization 
 
The most significant mineralization discovered to date on the West Desert property consists of sphalerite 
with minor chalcopyrite occurring in a series of concordant to discordant magnetite-bearing skarns and 
replacement bodies in carbonate rocks south of and adjacent to the quartz monzonite intrusive complex.  
Two main types of skarn have been distinguished on the basis of mineralogy, generally reflecting the 
chemistry of the host rock.  The most common type is magnesian, consisting of humite ± magnetite ± 
phlogopite along with lesser spinel, periclase, actinolite, forsterite, and tremolite.  Humite and forsterite 
may be partly retrograded to serpentine, brucite, and/or talc.  Phlogopite may be partly altered to 
chlorite, while periclase may be converted to brucite.  Magnetite in the deposit is very abundant and 
often massive.  In some cases, it contains relatively high levels of MgO and may be more properly 
named magnesioferrite, a Mg-rich member of the magnetite group of minerals.  However, levels of MgO 
are variable, and the term "magnetite" will be used for the remainder of the report.

A second and less common type of skarn is more calcareous in composition.  It generally exhibits a less 
disrupted character, with preserved bedding replaced by alternating bands of reddish brown grossularite 
garnet separated by bands of fine-grained diopside and potassium feldspar, probably reflecting a 
protolith of thinly bedded limestone with shaly partings.  Magnetite is occasionally present. 
 
Two main areas of zinc mineralization have been found, the Main and Deep zones, neither of which is 
exposed in outcrop.  The two zones are separated by the Juab fault.  Figure 7.5 illustrates a typical cross-
section in the West Desert deposit area. 
 
7.2.1 Main Zone 
 
The Main Zone occurs in Ordovician Pogonip Group carbonate rocks, and possibly in some Ely Springs 
Dolomite, situated within the hanging wall north of the Juab fault and immediately south of the sub-
cropping quartz monzonite cupola.  The Main Zone is bounded on the south by the Juab fault and the 
weakly mineralized and skarn-altered footwall Notch Peak Formation.  In the western part of the 
deposit, sphalerite-chalcopyrite mineralization occurs in irregular bodies of humite-phlogopite skarn, 
with or without magnetite.  Magnetite abundance declines in the eastern part of the zone, and the 
proportion of coarse-grained phlogopite increases as does the amount of pyrite.  The overall abundance 
of pyrite and other iron sulfides such as pyrrhotite in the West Desert system is very low.  
 
Sphalerite in the Main Zone is medium to coarse grained and red-brown to brown in color.  Petrographic 
work shows that it typically occurs as relatively coarse aggregates up to about 1cm across composed of 
roughly equant anhedra with a mosaic texture.  Individual grains are generally 0.1 to 1mm in size but 
can range up to 5mm in diameter.  Sphalerite also occurs intermixed with or interstitial to magnetite.  
Sphalerite often contains small amounts of chalcopyrite and lesser (?) pyrrhotite as tiny grains along 
crystal grain boundaries, randomly or crystallographically oriented arrays of grains within a single 
sphalerite grain, or as irregular anhedra.  Chalcopyrite inclusions in sphalerite may be partly altered to 
bornite or, rarely, chalcocite.  Very small amounts of pyrite and pyrrhotite are found scattered 
throughout zones of sphalerite mineralization.

Where it does not occur within sphalerite, chalcopyrite tends to be found as disseminated grains and 
blebs ranging from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter.  Copper grades are not directly 
proportional to those of zinc, its distribution typically only partially overlapping with that of zinc in any 
given drilled interval.  However, there appears to be at least a rough increase in the Cu/Zn ratio with 
proximity to the intrusion, and discrete zones of copper enrichment are definable. 
 
To date, Main Zone mineralization has been traced with drilling over a length of about 525m, a width of 
about 150m, and to a depth of 575m and remains open to the west and to depth.  Because of strong 
alteration, probable disruption of bedding by intrusive stoping, and a lack of suitable marker horizons, 
stratigraphic correlations and the degree of discordancy of skarn and replacement mineralization in this 
area are difficult to ascertain.  In addition, original sedimentary features have been largely obliterated 
within skarn zones, which may include chaotically disrupted and brecciated textures.  However, it 
appears that bedding tends to dip steeply to the north in the immediate vicinity of the deposit and that 
mineralization is preferentially developed in more thinly bedded units, probably the Kanosh Shale and 
Wah Wah Limestone, although portions of the Ely Springs Dolomite may also be involved.  More 
thickly bedded or massive units in the section, particularly dolomitic ones, are more likely to have been 
marbleized. 
 
The upper part of the West Desert system includes a number of extremely siliceous zones, at least some 
of which are probably tilted (stoped) blocks of Eureka Quartzite.  However, the overall volume of 
siliceous rock appears to be greater than would be suggested by nearby undisturbed occurrences of this 
unit, and thus some parts of these zones may represent massive, pervasive silicification of dolostones 
and limestones resulting in a fractured, dark grey, granular, highly siliceous rock.  Quartz-rich zones in 
the upper portions of the intrusive cupola may, in part, represent partly consumed and dismembered rafts 
of Eureka Quartzite. 
 
The Main Zone has been oxidized to an average depth of about 250m.  Sphalerite and chalcopyrite have 
been converted to a mixture of smithsonite, hemimorphite, hydrozincite, and zincite, with lesser 
wulfenite, covellite, franklinite, malachite, and gageite in a matrix of various iron and manganese 
oxides.  The deposit is overlain by Pleistocene gravels ranging in thickness from 2-40m. 
 
7.2.2 Deep Zone 
 
The Deep Zone is located immediately south of the Juab fault and is hosted predominantly within thinly 
bedded limestones and shaly members of the Orr Formation, probably the Corset Spring Shale and 
Candland Shale members.  Stratigraphic correlations are much clearer here due to less apparent 
structural complications within the Juab fault footwall.  Mineralization also occurs as proximal skarn 
along the contact of the Orr Formation and the underlying quartz monzonite intrusive.  Mineralization 
consists of coarse-grained, reddish sphalerite with minor disseminated chalcopyrite, pyrite, and/or 
pyrrhotite that are found in stratabound bodies of semi-massive to massive magnetite intercalated with 
humite ± periclase skarn, grossularite-diopside-K feldspar skarn, and marble.  The marble tends to 
contain abundant fracture-fillings of magnetite in proximity to massive magnetite layers.  Humite within 
magnetite-rich zones tends to be serpentinized.  Significant portions of the massive to thick-bedded 
dolostones of the overlying Notch Peak Formation have been converted to marble.

At least three separate mineralized horizons have been identified through drilling over an area of about 
330m by 225m at depths of between about 450 to 750m.  They remain open to the west, south, and 
possibly the east. 
 
7.2.3 Skarn-Hosted Indium and Molybdenum 
 
Indium is present in significant quantities in the West Desert deposit.  Initial petrographic work and 
energy dispersive X-ray ("EDX") analysis have shown that it occurs in the sphalerite lattice in amounts 
as high as an exceptional 9% by weight along with minor amounts of cadmium and manganese.  
Sphalerite with high indium content tends to be green in color and typically shows "chalcopyrite 
disease" textures; Figure 7.6 shows an extreme example of high-indium sphalerite.  Despite its 
essentially exclusive occurrence in sphalerite, there is not a direct relationship between zinc grade and 
indium grade.  The highest indium grades tend to occur in mineralization with a zinc grade of between 
0.5 and 5%.   
 
Numerous intervals of skarn mineralization have been found to contain significant levels of 
molybdenum, although it is not obvious macroscopically.  Petrographic work has shown that it occurs as 
small scattered laths associated with magnetite grains in partly serpentinized humite, apparently as a 
primary constituent of skarn.  
 
Finally, small amounts of two bismuth minerals tentatively identified as bursaite (Pb5Bi4S11) and 
tsumoite (BiTe) have been identified in skarn from the eastern part of the deposit.  Analytical data show 
that in addition to the main elements of interest – Zn, Cu, In, and Mo – trace elements enriched to 
varying degrees in skarn mineralization include Cd, Ag, Mn, Sn, Co, and Au. 
 
7.2.4 Other Skarn Occurrences 
 
Utah drill hole CC-43 intersected a 3.05m interval grading 7.65% Zn, 3.50% Cu, and 0.100% Mo within 
a 7.6m interval of semi-massive to massive sulfides at a depth of 889m and a horizontal distance of 
about 650m to the east of the Main Zone.  Pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and molybdenite in this 
interval occur as veins, masses, and strong disseminations in a thinly bedded limestone with shaly 
partings.  A highly siliceous rock immediately above this interval was logged as quartzite, but its biotite 
and sulfide content as well as its location within an argillically and propylitically altered granite suggest 
that it may be a highly siliceous intrusive phase.  The presence of disseminated magnetite over a 70m 
interval in the shaly limestone below the sulfide mineralization suggests incipient skarn development, 
potentially related to the main West Desert hydrothermal system. 
 
Although drilling north of the main intrusive cupola is sparse and generally shallow, several historic drill 
holes intersected narrow intervals of skarn zinc mineralization in this area, suggesting potential to 
discover additional resources here.

7.2.5 Replacement Style Ag-Zn-Pb 
 
In the eastern portion of the property, silver-rich galena with minor sphalerite and pyrite occur in steeply 
dipping, structurally controlled, and somewhat discontinuous replacement zones within the Ely Springs 
and Laketown dolomites.  The most significant zone outlined to date is that exploited by the historic 
Utah and Galena mines, where mineralization occurs in the vicinity of but not immediately adjacent to 
the Utah dike.  A total of about 3,960m of workings on six levels were accessed via the 246.9m Utah 
shaft.  The Galena mine immediately to the west was accessed via the 213.4m Galena shaft and included 
a total of about 915m of workings, one of which connected with the Utah mine on the 512ft (156m) 
level.  Mine development extended between 152 and 243m to the west and east respectively of the Utah 
shaft.  Minor production of similar mineralization was derived from the Emma mine and to a much 
lesser extent from a number of small excavations to the southeast, including the Wilson and Carnation 
mines.  Most of the total production from the Fish Springs district between 1890 and 1953 came from 
the replacement mineralization in the Utah, Galena, and Emma mines (Perry and McCarthy, 1976). 
 
Underground mapping by Utah on the uppermost 269- and 440ft (82- and 134m) levels of the Utah mine 
indicated that the best mineralization occurred in the central part of the mine where a pipe-like structure 
with a diameter of approximately 60m resulted from the intersection of fault structures.  Mineralization 
consisted of irregular pods of anglesite, cerussite, smithsonite, covellite, willemite, malachite, 
hemimorphite, aurichalcite, and wulfenite in a matrix of iron and manganese oxides situated adjacent to, 
but generally not within structures.  The cores of larger masses of ore as well as mineralization below 
the water table in the deepest parts of the mine showed that these oxidation products were derived from 
a relatively simple sulfide mineralogy of galena and pyrite with minor sphalerite and chalcopyrite. 
 
Gorman and Jones (1981) noted that silver and lead grades tended to increase with depth and reported 
that grades above the 440-level (134m level) averaged 5.5% lead and 754g Ag/t, while the grades on the 
lowermost 812-level (247m level) were 24% Pb and 1,166g Ag/t.  A deep drill hole (CC-43) completed 
by Utah below the Utah workings intersected a 2.87m interval grading 6.8% Zn, 3.8% Pb, and 167.1g 
Ag/t approximately 230m below the lowermost mine level, indicating that mineralization continues to 
depth. 
 
InZinc drill hole C08-07A was aimed to test the down-plunge extension of the Utah mine zone between 
the lowermost mine workings and the intercept in hole CC-43.  It unexpectedly intersected 
unmineralized Eureka Quartzite at the point where mineralization was projected to be present.  The 
Eureka Quartzite is not mineralized elsewhere on the property and is not considered to be a favorable 
host for the development of skarn or replacement-style mineralization.  It is not a thick unit and as a 
result, the potential for additional Utah zone mineralization in the adjacent carbonate rocks remains. 
 
InZinc drill hole C08-11 intersected a wide interval of replacement-style silver-zinc-lead mineralization 
to the east of the Main Zone, including a 10.83m interval grading 253.8g Ag/t, 4.28% Zn, and 0.68% Pb. 
Numerous other intercepts of high-grade silver mineralization within the oxide zone were encountered 
in historic drilling, including 10.21m grading 207.8g Ag/t, 12.81% Zn, and 0.98% Pb in hole CC-34 and 
3.56m grading 361.5g Ag/t, 10.19% Zn, and 12.95% Pb in hole CC-27.  These intercepts and others 
suggest significant potential for other high-grade replacement zones in the West Desert vicinity, similar 
to but distinct from that mined historically at the Utah mine.

7.2.6 Molybdenum 
 
In addition to disseminations in skarn, molybdenite occurs in porphyry-style quartz-pyrite veinlets; 
larger, banded, quartz-pyrite veins; and as fracture coatings in the quartz monzonite intrusion underlying 
the Deep Zone.  More intensely mineralized zones in the intrusion tend to be argillically altered and 
sericitized and include small amounts of oxidized, disseminated pyrite.  The general distribution of 
mineralization on the West Desert property, with a lower molybdenum-bearing zone grading upwards 
and outwards through copper, zinc, and then lead and silver-rich zones with increasing distance from the 
quartz monzonite intrusion, suggests that mineralization at West Desert may be related to a large 
underlying porphyry molybdenum system.  Agnerian (1993) reported that hole CCC-15 contained an 
intersection of 0.5% to 3% MoS2 over 18.6m.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The principal mineral deposits thus far identified in the Fish Springs mining district formed as part of a 
large skarn/carbonate replacement system.  In general, skarns are formed when hydrothermal fluids 
containing silica, various metals, and other dissolved components are introduced into carbonate host 
rocks, resulting in the formation of calc-silicate minerals such as garnet, diopside, epidote, biotite, 
chlorite, amphibole, wollastonite, and idocrase.  In more magnesian hosts, such as those at West Desert, 
humite, periclase, and olivine may instead be present.  Iron oxides such as magnetite and sulfides such 
as chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, and arsenopyrite are deposited in the system, along 
with variable amounts of gold and silver.  Skarn deposits are often, but not always, associated with 
intrusive rocks and are generally, but not always, developed in carbonate rocks.  They have been 
classified into seven types on the basis of metallic affinity: Fe, Au, Cu, Zn, W, Mo, and Sn (Meinart et 
al., 2005). 
 
As defined by Meinart et al., zinc skarns are usually related to oxidized dioritic to high-silica rhyolitic 
intrusions that may be barren or contain sub-economic copper and/or molybdenum  tungsten  tin 
deposits.  The skarns are mined primarily for zinc-lead-silver ores and commonly contain recoverable 
copper, gold, molybdenum, and tin and/or tungsten.  Mineralization is found in the form of stratabound 
mantos or cross-cutting, chimney-style replacements in limestone and dolostone, often distal (up to 
several kilometers) from their genetically associated intrusions.  Mineralogical and chemical zonations 
within the skarns are well developed, but contact-metamorphic aureoles are usually absent or weakly 
developed.  In addition to their metal associations, zinc skarns are generally distinguished from other 
skarns by a distinctive suite of iron and manganese-rich alteration minerals, including olivine, chlorite, 
pyroxene, garnet, serpentine, amphibole, pyroxenoids, and ilvaite; by the lack of a significant 
metamorphic aureole centered on the skarn; and by their occurrence along structural and lithologic 
contacts.  
 
Carbonate replacement deposits ("CRD") have been described by Megaw (1998), Titley (1993), and 
others as a broader category of high-temperature, carbonate-hosted massive sulfide deposits within 
which zinc skarns could be placed, but which would also include systems with no calc-silicate 
development.  Contacts between sulfide mineralization and host rocks are generally very sharp, and 
replacement textures are typical.  They generally display a simple, polymetallic assemblage of galena, 
sphalerite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and pyrite or pyrrhotite along with carbonate, sulfate, fluorite, and 
quartz gangue.  They also may contain recoverable molybdenum, tungsten, tin, cadmium, gallium, 
germanium, and indium.  Examples are widespread throughout the Cordillera of North and South 
America, including the zinc-rich Gilman and Leadville deposits in Colorado, the Midway and Ketza 
River deposits in Canada, and the Charcas, San Martin, and Bismarck deposits in Mexico. 
 
The principal mineral deposits thus far identified on the West Desert property are related to a felsic 
intrusion of Late Eocene age.  A number of Utah's most significant historic mining camps, from which 
large-scale mineral production has been derived, are based on carbonate replacement and skarn deposits 
related to similar felsic intrusive systems of Late Eocene to Early Oligocene age (Krahulec, 2007).  
Examples include the Main Tintic, Bingham, and Park City districts about 115 to 190km to the east of 
the West Desert property.  In the case of Bingham, the replacement deposits are peripheral and related to

associated with the intrusive bodies at Tintic and Park City.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 
InZinc acquired the West Desert property from EuroZinc in 2005.  In continuing the compilation of 
historic results, InZinc found that all historic drill core had been lost.   
 
Since 2006, InZinc has conducted exploration that included photogrammetry, a helicopter-borne 
magnetic survey, a pole-dipole IP survey, 10,639m of core drilling, and preliminary metallurgical test 
work.  In addition, the existing computer database was enhanced and corrected using original data 
records.  
 
InZinc's drilling activities are described in Section 10.0; its metallurgical investigations are described in 
Section 13.0. 
 
9.1 Photogrammetry 
 
In 2006, InZinc contracted with Eagle Mapping to carry out a program of 1:8,000-scale color aerial 
photography over the general property area and to construct a detailed (2m contour) 1:2,000-scale 
topographic map and orthophoto of the central portion of the property.  These maps were used as a base 
for further work. 
 
9.2 Magnetic Survey 
 
In 2006, McPhar Geosurveys Ltd. was contracted to carry out a high-resolution, helicopter-borne 
magnetic survey of the general property area.  Approximately 1,018 line-km of survey were flown at a 
line spacing of 100m and a mean terrain clearance of 30m for the magnetometer.  Deliverables included 
plots of total field magnetic, reduction to pole, first and second vertical derivatives, horizontal gradient, 
and analytic signal data. 
 
Figure 9.1 illustrates the calculated horizontal gradient of total magnetic intensity in the property area 
and shows a massive positive magnetic anomaly centered on the West Desert deposit.

9.3 Induced Polarization Survey 
 
In 2006, Peter E. Walcott and Associates Limited carried out a pole-dipole IP survey over the central 
part of the property.  Approximately 25km of surveying on lines spaced 200m apart were completed 
using an "A" spacing of 100m.  Deliverables included a series of pseudosections and plan views, 
including modeled data at elevations of 1200, 1300, and 1400m ASL. 
 
The results of the survey showed a distinct chargeability anomaly apparently centered on known zinc 
mineralization, as well as a separate and similar but somewhat deeper anomaly located approximately 
1km to the east.  Figure 9.2 illustrates a plan of modeled chargeability values at an elevation of 1200m 
ASL.  InZinc drill hole C08-15 targeted the eastern anomaly and intersected both intrusive rocks and 
sections of carbonates with varying development of skarn along with geochemically elevated levels of 
zinc.

10.0 DRILLING 
 
10.1 Summary 
 
Four campaigns of drilling involving a total of 85 core and RC exploration holes totaling 38,138m have 
been carried out on the West Desert property.  No additional drilling has been conducted since 
completion of the previous technical report (Tietz et al., 2010).  Table 10.1 summarizes the drill-hole 
data in the database, while Figure 10.1 shows the distribution of holes on the property.  Down-hole 
depths range from a few tens of meters to approximately 1,000m.  The majority of these holes were 
either inclined due south or were vertical and tested the West Desert deposit area on north-south sections 
at a rough average spacing of about 75m.

10.2 Historic Drilling 
 
Pinnacle's holes were drilled by Kissner Drilling Company of Cedaredge, Colorado, and were collared 
at BX size, reducing to AX size down the hole.  The first few of Utah's holes were drilled by Nichols 
Drilling Company; the remainder, as well as Cyprus' holes, were drilled by Boyles Brothers.  Records 
are incomplete, but it appears that for the both the Utah and Cyprus drilling, core holes were generally 
initiated at NQ size or equivalent, reducing to BQ size or further as down-hole conditions required.  
Apparently for Cyprus' Phase I drilling, it was intended that the upper portions of the angle core holes 
be drilled with rotary drilling, but that was not successful, and core drilling was used instead 
(Cyprus/Mitsui Joint Venture Geologists, 1990).

down hole, the method varying between operators (Rockingham (2001) and Agnerian (1993) incorrectly 
reported that the Utah holes had not been surveyed).  Utah's gyroscopic data were collected by Mollen-
Hauer Surveying Company, and InZinc has copies of their survey reports.  Utah's dip-test data were 
recorded in an internal corporate memo from 1967, now in InZinc's files.  Cyprus' gyroscopic data were 
collected by Navi-Drill, and InZinc has copies of their survey reports.  InZinc personnel were able to 
locate most of the historic drill collars and surveyed their geographic location using a differential GPS.  
 
Bernardi and Ohlin (1991b) noted that previous holes drilled at inclinations of 55° or less at West Desert 
tended to shallow, which meant that intercepts could be shallower and further south than originally 
thought. 
 
MDA has no further details on drilling procedures by previous operators.

10.3 Drilling by InZinc Mining Ltd. 
 
For its 2007-2008 drilling program, InZinc used Connors Drilling LLC of Montrose, Colorado.  InZinc's 
program initially involved one Atlas Copco CS-14 drill.  A Longyear 44 drill rig was subsequently 
added and then replaced with a second CS-14 (see Figure 10.2).  Once bedrock was reached, all holes 
were started at HQ size, producing a 63.5mm-diameter core.  When necessary to overcome drilling 
difficulties, a number of the holes were reduced in size to NQ, a 47.625mm-diameter core.  
 
The core was placed in 1.2m-long, three-run wooden core boxes at the drill site.  Drillers measured the 
core recovery as the core was put into the core boxes.  Loaded core boxes were then trucked a few 
hundred meters to InZinc's on-site core logging, sampling, and storage facility. 
 
Once delivered to InZinc's on-site facility, the core was measured for RQD and core recovery, and core 
markers were converted to metric units.  Subsequently, all core was digitally photographed, wet and dry, 
in a fixed setup to assure constant exposure, distance, and focus, before being geologically logged and 
marked for sampling. 
 
The down-hole orientations of the drill holes were measured by a technician from International 
Directional Services using a gyroscopic instrument not affected by magnetic variations.  The instrument 
was lowered to the bottom of each hole, and measurements were digitally recorded every 15.2m (50ft) 
as it was raised back up the hole.  Recorded data included depth, azimuth, inclination, and temperature.  
Finally, corrected survey data were derived on site and delivered as a digital file to InZinc's on-site staff.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 
 
11.1 Sampling 
 
11.1.1 Historic Sampling 
 
Utah's samples of core ranged from 0.5 to 5m in length, but the majority were between 1 and 2m.  
Cyprus' core samples ranged in length from 0.3 to 4m, but the majority were between 1.5 and 2m in 
length.  There are no detailed descriptions of sampling procedures available for either company, but 
reports of the re-logging of significant quantities of Utah core by Cyprus suggest that Utah had followed 
the then-current industry standard of splitting the core in half, with one half retained and the other sent 
to the laboratory.  Cyprus used the same standard sampling methodology and, as was standard practice 
at the time, did not insert quality control samples of their own (pers. comm., M. Bernardi - Cyprus 
Project Manager).  Although no relevant information is available, it should be assumed that Utah also 
did not insert their own quality control samples. 
 
11.1.2 InZinc Sampling 
 
Samples were selected and marked by InZinc's geologist as the core was being logged.  Sample 
intervals were chosen on the basis of lithology, mineralization, and alteration and ranged in length 
between a minimum of about 0.5m and a maximum of about 2m.  Local employees directly supervised 
by the geologist then either sawed the core in half using a water-cooled diamond saw or, if the core was 
fragile, contained potentially soluble minerals, or was otherwise unsuitable for sawing, split it in half 
using a hydraulic core splitter. 
 
11.1.3 Core Recovery Determinations 
 
11.1.3.1 Historic Core Recovery 
 
All of the historic drill campaigns recorded core recovery data, and the current InZinc data set includes 
over 12,600 individual core recovery records.  The average core recovery for all of the historic drilling is 
approximately 85%, with 10% of the drill runs having less than 50% core recovery.  There is a general 
correlation within the data set between core recovery and core diameter with the smaller core (AX and 
BX) having lower recoveries, on average, than the larger NX core.  The great majority of the historic 
drilling is NX-size core.     
 
11.1.3.2 InZinc Core Recovery 
 
Core recovery data were noted by the drillers for all 17 InZinc core holes.  InZinc field technicians 
separately collected core recovery data for the upper half of drill hole C07-01 and the full lengths of 
holes C07-03 and C08-07A through C08-15.  The average core recovery for both data sets is greater 
than 97% with just 2% and 3% of the drill runs, for the driller and InZinc data sets, respectively, having 
less than 50% core recovery.  The generally excellent core recovery lends confidence to the current 
resource estimate.

11.2 Historic Sample Preparation and Analysis 
 
Sampling information and analytical data for historic drill holes are only available as recorded in historic 
drill logs.  Although assay certificates were not available for Cyprus' work, it is known that Cyprus' 
samples were analyzed by ALS Chemex ("Chemex") at their laboratory in Sparks, Nevada (pers.comm, 
Bernardi, M.) for a suite of elements including Zn, Cu, Pb, Ag, Au, Co, Mn, Mo, Ni, and Fe (Agnerian, 
1993).  
 
Drill logs for Pinnacle's two holes included data for Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, and Au for almost all sampled 
intervals, as well as sporadic data for Fe, Sn, Mo, and Co.  Cyprus' drill logs included assay data for Cu, 
Pb, Zn, and Ag for all holes, as well as Au, Fe, Cd, and As data for some intervals in some holes.  Utah's 
drill logs included data for Cu, Pb, Zn, and Ag for all holes, as well as sporadic data for Au, Fe, Sn, Sb, 
Mo, Co, Cd, As, W, Bi, Mn, and Ni.  The Utah data set also includes magnetite iron data from Davis 
Tube magnetic separation analyses. 
  
No information is available regarding details of analytical methods or any security measures that might 
have been taken with sampling in historic drill campaigns. 
  
There is no information concerning quality assurance/quality control analyses on the historic drill data. 
 
11.3 Sampling Preparation and Analysis by InZinc Mining Ltd. 
 
Following core splitting, samples were placed in fabric bags labeled with a sample number.  A tag with 
the sample number was placed into each bag.  Bags were then sealed and stored in a 6m locked storage 
container of the type used in rail, truck, and ship transport, which had been modified for use in the field.  
Samples were delivered by InZinc personnel to Chemex's laboratory in Elko, Nevada, on a weekly to bi-
weekly basis.  At the request of Chemex, samples estimated to contain more than about 10% zinc on the 
basis of their sphalerite content were segregated and labeled as "high grade" before delivery to the 
laboratory.  A series of "overlimit" protocols was established for Zn, Ag, Cu, Pb, and Mo, in which 
samples which exceeded the limits of a given analytical technique were automatically scheduled for re-
assay with a technique suited for higher-grade material. 
 
Regular samples were dried, weighed, crushed, split, and pulverized at the laboratory in Elko before 
being analyzed for gold.  Analysis was by Chemex's AA23 method of fire assay fusion of a 30g 
subsample followed by atomic absorption analysis ("FA-AA").  Sample pulps were then sent to 
Chemex's Vancouver laboratory to be analyzed for Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, 
Fe, Ga, Ge, Hf, In, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Re, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Sn, Sr, Ta, Te, Th, 
Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zn, and Zr using their ME-MS61 method of combined ICP-MS and ICP-AES 
technology following a four-acid digestion.  The upper concentration limit for most metals of interest 
was 10,000ppm or 1%.  Samples exceeding this limit were re-assayed using one of the techniques 
described below. 
 
Samples that had been segregated as "high grade" were dried, weighed, crushed, split, and pulverized 
before being analyzed for gold in Elko using Chemex's AA23 30g FA-AA method.  Sample pulps were 
then sent to Chemex's Vancouver laboratory to be analyzed for Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn 
using their "ore grade" OG-62 method of combined atomic absorption and ICP-AES technology

following a four-acid digestion.  Regular samples whose metal contents exceeded the limits of the ME-
MS61 method were re-assayed by the OG-62 method.  Samples that were found to contain greater than 
30% zinc using the OG-62 method were re-assayed using Chemex's ME-CON02 method.  Indium was 
not determined in the OG-62 method, and samples were either re-assayed for indium through ME-MS61 
if zinc contents were low enough or through a concentrate method such as ME-CON02 or ME-MS61c if 
they were too high. 
 
In 2013, a total of 719 pulp samples, including 82 QA/QC samples, were sent to AGAT laboratories in 
Mississauga, Ontario, Canada for total iron analyses.  The total iron analyses were by sodium peroxide 
fusion and then ICP-OES technology.  Included in the analyses were results for Al, As, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, 
Pb, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, K, Si, S, Sn, Ti, V, and Zn. As a check on these initial total iron analyses, twenty 
pulps were re-analyzed using four different analytical methods: four-acid digestion with an ICP-OES 
finish, classical titration, lithium borate fusion with an XRF finish, and sodium peroxide fusion with an 
ICP-OES finish.  
 
A sub-set of 107of the initial pulps were analyzed for iron-in-magnetite and magnetite using Davis Tube 
magnetic separation procedures and then duplicate iron analyses by sodium peroxide fusion with an 
ICP-OES finish  
 
11.4 InZinc Quality-Control Protocol 
 
A quality-control ("QC") protocol involving a variety of standards and duplicates as well as a blank was 
implemented by InZinc for all samples from the project.  Every 11th sample was either a standard 
(chosen on the basis of mineralization type and expected grade), a duplicate of some type, or a blank. 
 
For the 2007-2008 drilling program, a series of commercially available certified standards was chosen 
and purchased on the basis of expected types and grade ranges of mineralization, including low- and 
high-zinc values in oxide and sulfide mineralization (Table 11.1).  The standard to be used at any given 
point was chosen on the basis of the mineralization in nearby core.  Standards were stored at Chemex's 
lab and inserted into the sample stream by Chemex personnel as per InZinc's written directions with 
each shipment.  Standards used are listed in Table 11.1.

Several types of duplicates were used as follows: 

preparation duplicate: second, duplicate pulp from the original sample reject was requested 

assay duplicate: duplicate analysis of the first pulp from a given sample was requested 

field duplicate: second half of core collected in the field 
 
Blank material was collected from an outcrop of barren Tertiary rhyolite about 32km south of the West 
Desert property and inserted into the sample stream at the West Desert site. 
 
The 2013 QA/QC program used the same protocol as for the 2007-2008 drill program including 
standards, blanks, and three types of duplicates.  The two types of standards used were obtained from the 
Canada Centre for Mineral and Energy Technology.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION  
 
From the perspective of data verification, there are two classes of data in the West Desert database.  First 
in terms of verifiability, there are data generated by InZinc.  MDA was able to verify these through a 
combination of site visits, visual inspection of the core, discussions with the InZinc employees who 
originated the information, and checking of original sources such as laboratory certificates and data files. 
 
Second in terms of verifiability are the historic data.  Most of these exist in paper records that InZinc 
inherited from prior operators.  These paper records are completely plausible, but most are photocopies 
of the original documents.  One deficiency is the lack of original analytical certificates, even as 
photocopies, though Cyprus' analytical work was carried out at Chemex (now ALS Chemex), and the 
records are still available in the latter's files.  InZinc has made inquiries in the hope of obtaining 
permission to get these original certificates from Cyprus' successor but has not been successful.  The 
closest thing to an original source for historic assays is entries in photocopies of drill logs.   
 
No historic drill core or sample material exists for visual inspection or verification sampling.  InZinc did 
not drill specifically designated twin holes, but many of their holes targeted similar locations within the 
deposit.  Results generally indicated good correlation between the geology encountered within the 
historic and InZinc drilling.  The depth to the mineralization and the variability commonplace within 
skarn systems would make any twin program impractical. 
 
MDA has audited the historic database using the available sources, as described in Section 12.1, and has 
no reason to suspect that any systematic problems exist.  However, MDA cannot state that it has 
checked the historic database using entirely original sources.  Utah and Cyprus (now Freeport-
McMoran) were major companies involved in exploration and mining, and there are no indications that 
industry-standard practices and procedures were not followed in their work on the West Desert project.  
The authors believe that the historic data are suitable for use in a resource estimate. 
 
12.1 Verification of Historic Data 
 
12.1.1 Assay Table 
 
12.1.1.1 Base and Precious Metals 
 
MDA received a copy of the historic assay table in the form of an Excel(™) spreadsheet containing 
4,347 records for base and precious metals.  MDA checked 1,028 or about 24% of the records against 
the entries in old drill logs.  The fields that MDA checked were Ag (oz), Pb (%), Cu (%), Au (oz) and 
Zn (%).  The error rates that MDA found were as follow: 
 

Element Ag Pb Cu Au Zn 

Error Rate 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.3 % 0.5 % 0.2 % 

 
The errors that MDA identified would not have had a significant effect on the resource estimate.  It is 
assumed but cannot be proven that assay entry errors in the 76% of the historic assay table that MDA 
did not check would have a similarly insignificant effect.

12.1.1.2 Iron Assays 
 
MDA checked roughly 20% of the historic (pre-InZinc) iron assays in the assay table during a visit to 
InZinc's office in early November of 2013.  Checks were done by comparing the iron values in the assay 
table to those recorded in copies of historic drill logs or assay lists that are kept on file by InZinc.  
Original certificates are not available for the historic iron assays.  MDA did not find any data entry 
errors in the assays.  Small numbers of other types of issues were identified, as described in the 
following paragraphs. 
 
In hole CC-1, there are four intervals for which no iron assay had originally been obtained, but an iron 
value was assigned to each of the four intervals.  The assigned value was obtained by averaging the 
immediately preceding and following iron assays.  MDA elected to not use these four assigned values. 
 
In hole CC-13, one iron assay that was present in the historic hard-copy of an assay compilation had not 
been entered into the database.  MDA and InZinc were unable to identify any reason why the assay 
would not have been used, so it is presumed to have been an unintentional omission.  MDA added the 
assay to the database. 
 
In hole CC-11B, one assay interval is shorter in the historic  information than in the database, 1.16 
meters compared to 1.37 meters.  The shorter interval is also displaced vertically by 1.16 meters.  This 
interval does not contain significant iron.  MDA chose to use the interval that was already in the 
database. 
 
Two intervals in the database, one in hole CC-10 and one in hole CC13, contain iron assays that do not 
appear in any historic documentation that MDA found.  This does not necessarily mean that the assays 
are wrong, only that they could not be verified.  MDA kept the iron values in the database. 
 
12.1.1.3 Davis Tube Analyses 
 
The historic data for the West Desert project include 698 Davis Tube analyses.  Original assay 
certificates are not available.  However, the results are summarized in five memoranda dated 1975 and 
1976.  MDA was able to check 550 of the Davis Tube analyses in the database against results reported in 
these memoranda.  Five records, amounting to about 0.9 percent of those checked, were found to contain 
minor differences, and these were corrected.  No significant differences were identified. 
 
Both MDA and InZinc suspect that the original Davis Tube data were probably reported with two-
decimal precision.  However, only one-decimal precision is recorded in the historical memoranda and in 
the project database. 
 
12.1.2 Collar Table 
 
Some earlier workers at West Desert located the drill-hole collars on a project-specific grid.  InZinc uses 
a UTM grid system based on NAD83.  InZinc identified as many of the old drill-hole sites as it could in 
the field, in part by using aerial photographic images to locate former sites.  In those cases in which it 
was able to identify the sites, InZinc re-surveyed the locations using a differential GPS.  Of 70 holes in 
the database drilled by former operators, InZinc was able to re-survey 45 collar locations.

May 2, 2014 Print date:5 May 2014 4:00 

MDA had little means at its disposal to verify the locations of old collars.  MDA did do a plausibility 
check, using a geo-registered ortho-photo obtained from InZinc.  MDA checked for plausibility by 
looking at the recorded location of the drill hole on the ortho-photo, checking the image for evidence of 
old disturbance suggestive of drill sites or drill-access roads.  It was possible to check 67 of the 68 
historic drill holes this way, and the locations of all 67 recorded in the current collar table are plausible.  
The one hole that could not be checked has a recorded location outside the area of the ortho-photo. 
 
12.1.3 Geologic Data Table 
 
The West Desert geology table contains 4,062 lithologic intervals, 3,124 of which are in historic drill 
holes.  MDA checked these against photocopies of the drill logs.  All of the checks that MDA did were 
done on the historic holes.  MDA checked the interval limits of 429 records and found that the database 
differed from the logs in nine instances, none of which would have a significant effect on the geologic 
model.  MDA checked the lithologic coding of 304 records and found differences in six instances, none 
of which would have a significant effect on the geologic model.  It should be noted that differences 
between interpretations by successions of workers probably account for some of these differences. 
 
12.1.4 Down-Hole Survey Table 
 
As discussed in Section 10.2, other than a few of the earliest holes, most of the historic drill holes on the 
property were surveyed down hole, and InZinc has survey reports or other documentation of the results 
from Utah and Cyprus' drilling. 
 
According to information in a table obtained from InZinc (Table 12.1), the down-hole orientations of the 
historic drill holes were obtained by one of three methods: dip test, gyroscopic, and measured from a 
paper section. 
 

Table 12.1  Down-Hole Survey Methodology for Historic Drilling 
 

Number of Holes Down-Hole Orientation Method 

11  dip test 

26  gyroscopic 

4  measured from paper section 

27  none (collar only) 

 
InZinc reports that for the Utah holes where dip information is shown as "measured from paper section," 
InZinc personnel derived the dips by measuring on original Utah sections. 
 
MDA has not verified the down-hole surveys for the historic drill holes. 
 
12.2 Verification of Data Generated by InZinc Mining Ltd. 
 
Data generated by InZinc are the most verifiable, and MDA checked them using different procedures 
than those employed for the historic data.

12.2.1 Assay Table 
 
12.2.1.1 Base and Precious Metals and Indium 
 
InZinc provided MDA with an assay table for use in modeling.  In related work, Giles Peatfield, P.Eng.  
and a consultant independent of InZinc, compiled an assay table independently of InZinc for use in 
evaluating the quality assurance/quality control ("QA/QC") data from the West Desert project (Section 
12.3).  Peatfield received the analytical data in digital form, directly from the laboratories.  MDA 
obtained a copy of the assay table compiled by Peatfield and used tools available in Microsoft Access™ 
database software to compare the Peatfield and InZinc tables.  The only significant difference that MDA 
found was one indium analysis that was in the Peatfield table and was not in the InZinc table.  This was 
resolved. 
 
12.2.1.2 Iron Assays 
 
The assay table contains 2,288 non-zero iron values in holes drilled by InZinc.  MDA was able to check 
2,185 of these iron values against those found in copies of original laboratory batch files, obtained from 
InZinc.  No data entry errors were found. 
 
There are three instances in the assay table in which the original iron assay obtained by ICP analysis 
exceeded the upper detection limit of 50% Fe, and no other iron analysis was obtained.  In these cases, 
an iron value of 50.01% Fe has been used in the database.  This is a reasonable choice under the 
circumstances. 
 
There are 200 instances in which the iron value used in the database was obtained from a sodium 
peroxide fusion - ICP-OES finish ("fusion analyses"), done by AGAT Laboratories Ltd.("AGAT").  
InZinc obtained the fusion analyses by submitting pulps to AGAT in the summer of 2013.  In total, 
InZinc obtained 627 fusion analyses from pulps, but these were only used in the database in those 
instances in which the original ICP iron assay exceeded the detection limit, or there had not been an 
original ICP iron assay. 
 
12.2.1.3 Davis Tube Analyses 
 
From the holes drilled by InZinc, 107 samples have Davis Tube analyses.  The magnetite and iron-in-
magnetite data for these samples were added to the database by MDA, taken directly from original assay 
certificates. 
 
12.2.2 Collar Table 
 
InZinc's collar table was compiled directly from data transmitted by email from the field, where collar 
locations were determined using a differential GPS.  The InZinc collar table is, in effect, the original.  
MDA did not independently survey the collar locations.

12.2.3 Geologic Data Table 
 
MDA worked with InZinc in the field during three separate visits and again modeling the geology of the 
deposit on sections at MDA's office.  MDA viewed drill core and otherwise worked closely with InZinc 
on the geologic model.  While the geological interpretations are primarily the product of work by InZinc 
personnel, MDA gained a high level of confidence in the geological data by working closely with 
InZinc. 
 
12.2.4 Down-Hole Survey Table 
 
The down-hole orientations of InZinc's drill holes were measured in the field by International 
Directional Services ("IDS") using a gyroscopic survey instrument.  The down-hole survey readings 
were transmitted from IDS to InZinc's office as digital data files, via email.  There is typically one such 
file for each hole.  InZinc compiled its down-hole survey table from those individual data files. 
 
MDA checked InZinc's down-hole survey table by compiling its own down-hole survey table using the 
individual IDS batch files, obtained from InZinc.  MDA did not consider it necessary to request that IDS 
send the batch files directly to MDA independently of InZinc.  MDA used tools available in Microsoft 
Access™ database software to compare the two down-hole survey tables and found no issues. 
 
12.3 Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
 
No QA/QC data are available for the historic drill data, and it is not known if past operators conducted 
any QA/QC analyses. 
 
12.3.1 Base and Precious Metals, Indium, Cadmium, Gallium, and Germanium 
 
Section 11.4 describes the QA/QC protocol used for InZinc's core drilling in 2007 and 2008.  Every 11th 
sample was a standard, a blank, or one of three types of duplicates (field, preparation, or assay).  
 
Giles R. Peatfield, a consulting geologist independent of InZinc, reviewed and analyzed InZinc's 
QA/QC data (Peatfield, 2009).  All assay data were sent directly to Peatfield by Chemex.  Peatfield's 
conclusions are summarized here. 
 
As described in Section 11.3, Chemex's ME-MS61 ICP analysis method was used for samples with 
lower metal contents, and the ME-OG62 method was used for "high grade" samples.  Gold was 
analyzed with the Au-AA23 method (FA-AA). 
 
12.3.1.1 Certified Standards 
 
Sulfide standards with certified values for gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc were obtained from CDN 
Resource Laboratories Ltd. ("CDN").  (Peatfield listed three CDN standards, but information provided 
by InZinc (Table 11.1) indicated there was a fourth CDN standard – CDN-HLHC.  InZinc reports that 
the standard CDN-HLHC was only used once but was inadvertently mislabeled in the dataset used by 
Peatfield.)  Standards from oxidized material with certified values for silver, copper, lead, and zinc were

obtained from Geostats Pty. Ltd. ("Geostats").  There were also standards assays for indium, cadmium, 
gallium, and germanium, although there were no certified values for these elements. 
 
Peatfield concluded from his analysis that the results for the CDN and Geostats standards for silver, 
copper, lead, and zinc were, in general, acceptable.  Although a very small number of results for the 
standards lay outside acceptable limits, they were not far enough outside to be of serious concern. 
 
The same standards were also analyzed for indium, cadmium, gallium, and germanium.  Because there 
were no certified values for these elements, the results did not address accuracy but rather were a very 
rough measure of the precision of assays for these elements.  Peatfield noted that almost all analyses lay 
within +10% of the mean but that the analyses for these four elements were less than optimally precise.  
He concluded that the levels of these trace elements should be determined in concentrates during 
metallurgical testing and that specific standards should be in place at that time. 
 
12.3.1.2 Blanks 
 
Peatfield reported that coarse "blank" samples were included in the 2008 core drilling.  He noted that 
assays to date lead one to question if the assumption that the blank material had negligible metal content 
was, strictly speaking, true. 
 
Peatfield analyzed results of assays for gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, indium, cadmium, 
gallium, and germanium and concluded that, on balance, the results for blanks were not perfect but 
acceptable, especially for zinc, lead, copper, and indium, which are the metals of main interest. 
 
12.3.1.3 Duplicate Assays 
 
Field, laboratory preparation, and assay laboratory (the lab made two analyses of a single pulp) duplicate 
assays were obtained by InZinc for 2007 and 2008 drilling, and Peatfield made correlation plots for all 
three types of duplicates and both methods of analyses (MS61 and OG62).  He concluded that, in 
general and especially for the metals of principal interest, the duplicate analyses suggested relatively 
good precision. 
 
12.3.1.4 Summary 
 
Overall Peatfield concluded that the results of the various quality control procedures show that assay 
data from InZinc's 2007 and 2008 core drilling are, in general terms, acceptable. 
 
Peatfield noted that establishing sampling and QC protocols for the project was an evolving process and 
that there are still unresolved procedural issues.  He recommended that a more rigorous method of 
inserting control samples be instituted for future drilling, particularly for sample shipments for "high 
grade" assays, which need to have controls inserted in regular rotation, perhaps with different standard 
materials.  Insertion of control samples for the drilling programs should be keyed to sample shipments, 
rather than being established beforehand on the basis of drilling intervals.

Peatfield also recommended that for future drill programs, alternate material should be found for blanks 
because there are some minor concerns about the levels of a few of the analyzed elements in the rhyolite 
used as blank material for a the 2007-2008 drilling. 
 
12.3.2 Iron 
 
Analysis of the QA/QC work performed by InZinc on iron was completed by MDA associate Mr. Peter 
Ronning. 
   
In 2013, InZinc sent 627 pulps from holes drilled by InZinc to AGAT, where they were re-analyzed 
using fusion analyses.  These were intended to be used as checks on the original iron analyses. 
 
Along with the pulps, InZinc sent quality control samples that included: 

 32 standards, each of which was one of two reference materials obtained from the Canada Centre 
for Mineral and Energy Technology ("CANMET"), 

 10 blanks, 

 20 field duplicates, 

 20 second pulp (preparation) duplicates, and 

 10 assay duplicates. 

An evaluation of the results obtained for the QA/QC samples was done by C.F. Staargaard, P. Geo., of 
InZinc.  The review by InZinc concluded that the QA/QC sample results indicate that the fusion 
analyses are of acceptable quality.  MDA has reviewed InZinc's evaluation of the QA/QC data and 
concurs with the conclusions reached by InZinc.  The results are briefly summarized in the paragraphs 
that follow. 
 
12.3.2.1 Standards 
 
InZinc used two standards obtained from CANMET, whose expected values are set out in Table 12.2.

InZinc evaluated the results produced by AGAT for the standards, using control charts that are 
variations of the common Shewhart-type charts.  One such chart is presented in Figure 12.1 as an 
example.

Figure 12.1 Control Chart for Iron in Standard RTS-3a 

 
 

Note in Figure 12.1 that InZinc has set the control limits at the expected value ("REF Mean") ± two 
standard deviations, using the "within lab" standard deviation provided by CANMET.  InZinc did a 
similar chart for RTS-3a using the "Lab Mean" obtained by AGAT, ± two standard deviations as 
obtained by AGAT, for control limits.  No failures were identified using that approach. 
 
Since the specifications on hand for SCH-1 do not include information as to standard deviations, InZinc 
evaluated the results for SCH-1 using statistics generated by AGAT's data.  No failures were identified. 
 
For both standards, the mean of the values obtained by AGAT is slightly lower than the expected value.  
The difference is greatest in SCH-1, in which AGAT's results average slightly more that 1% Fe lower 
than CANMET's expected value. 
 
MDA considers the results obtained by AGAT for the standards to be acceptable. 
 
12.3.2.2 Blanks 
 
Figure 12.2 illustrates the assays that AGAT obtained for iron in the blanks.

Figure 12.2 Assays for Iron in Blanks 

 
 

 
It is evident in Figure 12.2 that very low iron grades were obtained for the first four analyses of the 
blank material, and then starting with the fifth analysis, the measured iron grades climbed to about 0.8% 
Fe, before dropping again to a lower range.  InZinc and MDA have no explanation for this, but while the 
increase in the measured iron grades in the blanks shows contamination, it is not severe enough to have 
a material impact on a resource estimate.  
 
12.3.2.3 Duplicates 
 
InZinc evaluated the three types of duplicates in the iron fusion assay data set using scatterplots, which 
are shown in Figure 12.3.   
 
The three types of duplicates serve different purposes: 

 The duplicate assays test the precision (repeatability) of the AGAT iron assays; 
 The second pulp assays test the sample preparation done by ALS when the two separate pulps 

were originally prepared.  The largest part of the variation between the results for the two pulps 
was most likely introduced during the sample preparation, which includes several stages of 
particle-size reduction and sample splitting.  The precision of the AGAT assay process is also a 
factor in the variation. 

 The field-duplicate assays incorporate variation due to natural geological heterogeneity, 
sampling error, and variation introduced by the two processes listed above.

The scatterplots in Figure 12.3 show that the relationships between the duplicates and the originals are 
as expected.  No causes for concern are evident. 
 
12.3.2.4 Comparison of AGAT Fusion Assays to Original Iron Assays 
 
The original evaluation of the quality of InZinc's assays (Tietz, et. al., 2010) did not cover the iron 
assays conducted by ALS.  InZinc and MDA have compared the AGAT fusion iron assays to the 
original ALS iron assays, as a way of checking the quality of both, but primarily the latter.  The ALS 
iron assays were done as part of ALS' "ME-MS61" package, which ALS describes as an "ultra-trace 
level method using ICP-MS and ICP-AES." 
 
The results of the comparison are illustrated in Figure 12.4 and Figure 12.5.  It is evident in the figures 
that the correspondence between the two types of iron assays is good.  There is, however, a change in 
the relationship between the two that takes place at mean iron grades of about 30% Fe.  Below 30% Fe, 
the relative percent difference averages about +5%, the AGAT fusion assay being slightly higher than 
the ALS ICP assay.  Above 30% Fe, the relative percent difference averages about -3%, the fusion assay 
being slightly lower.  This is best illustrated by Figure 12.5.

If the paired assays are divided into two groups, those having means greater than 30% Fe and those 
having means less than 30% Fe, standard statistical tests, the T-test for the means and the Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test for the medians, suggest that the difference between the AGAT and ALS iron assays in 
each group is statistically significant.  MDA notes, however, that statistical significance does not equate 
to material significance in terms of the resource estimate and economic evaluation.  Subsequent testing 
using four different methods, including a new set of fusion analyses, agreed reasonably well with each 
other and with the original ALS ICP data.  The fusion data used in the mineral resource estimate can be 
considered conservative values.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
  
Jeffrey B. Austin, P. Eng. is the author of Section 13.0 and takes responsibility for the information 
presented in this section.  Sections of this report were updated from the 2010 Preliminary Economic 
Assessment (Nilsson, et al., 2010). 
 
The word "ore" in this section is used in a metallurgical sense and is not intended to imply the results of 
economic analysis. 
 
13.1 Metallurgical Sample Composites 
 
Cyprus conducted metallurgical test work in 1991, while InZinc commissioned test work in 2009 and 
2013; these programs are described below.  Drill core from exploration was used for all test work 
conducted on the West Desert project.  The selection of samples reflected an evolving operational plan 
and growing geological resource as the test work programs unfolded.  Table 13.1 presents a summary of 
test samples and sample grades, as well as objectives in the various test work programs.  Also included 
in the sample summary table for comparison purposes is the current resource's proposed mine 
production model grades for the deposit.  To the extent known, the samples used in various test work 
programs best represented the known mineralization at the time of testing and do represent the deposit as 
a whole.

For the testing in 2009 and 2013, InZinc arranged for the drill-core assay rejects to be delivered to 
G&T's facilities for testing. The assay rejects had been stored as the individual intervals defined by the 
drill-core program. 
 
13.2 Historical Test Work  
 
In early 1991, Cyprus completed a small program of bench-scale metallurgical test work to evaluate the 
potential to produce saleable zinc concentrates from the West Desert mineralized materials.  Three 
composites were prepared from 44 core samples, and traditional zinc flotation testing was completed.  
Results for sulfide samples were reported by Pacic (1991c), while results for oxide samples were 
reported by Pacic (1991b).

Three separate composites were prepared from drill core from the project and were used in the flotation 
to produce zinc concentrates without consideration of producing copper concentrates.  The copper 
content of these three samples was quite low, and zinc to copper ratios were in the order of 30 to 1.  
Test-work samples used by Cyprus were considered high grade, in the range of 10 to 11 percent zinc 
(Table 13.1). 
 
Zinc recovery in rougher flotation was typically 98 percent, and final concentrate grades were in the 
range of 54 to 60 percent zinc.  Although locked cycle testing was not completed by Cyprus on these 
samples, the open circuit test results point to overall zinc recovery being predicted in the range of 94 to 
96 percent of overall zinc.   
 
Detailed evaluation of the zinc concentrates produced in the Cyprus test work showed low levels of 
arsenic, antimony, and mercury.  Cadmium and fluorine may be elements of concern in the zinc 
concentrate, based on the work of Cyprus.   
 
13.3 Metallurgical Testing by InZinc Mining Ltd. 
 
13.3.1 Metallurgical Testing at G & T Metallurgical Services Ltd. 
 
In 2009, InZinc initiated a test work program using the facilities of G&T Metallurgical Services Ltd. 
("G&T") of Kamloops, B.C.  This test work was looking at the use of traditional flotation test 
procedures to produce copper and zinc concentrates that could be sold in the marketplace.  Based upon 
diamond drilling by InZinc, the deposit has recoverable values of copper, zinc, indium, and magnetite. 
Samples were provided by InZinc, and compositing instructions were provided by KWM Consulting.  
Detailed test results were reported by G&T in 2009 (Report KM2450; Shouldice and Pojhan, 2009).   
 
A follow-up test work program was completed at ALS Metallurgical (formerly G&T) in April 2013 to 
evaluate the production of magnetite concentrates from the West Desert project (Report KM3738; 
Pupazzoni and Shouldice, 2013).   
 
A traditional copper and zinc flotation process involves the selective flotation of copper minerals while 
depressing zinc minerals in order to produce a saleable copper concentrate.  The tailings from the copper 
process become flotation feed for the zinc recovery process, which produces a zinc flotation concentrate.  
These processes are widely used for the recovery and upgrading of copper and zinc ores. 
 
13.3.1.1 Mineralogical Analysis of KM2450 Samples 
 
Detailed mineralogical analysis was undertaken on the three samples prepared at G&T in order to better 
understand the liberation issues of the various minerals in the samples.  The mineralogical results can be 
summarized as follows: 
 

1) Gangue mineralization is highly liberated at approximately 80 to 100 microns, including 
magnetite minerals.  This is important when considering the recovery and upgrading of 
magnetite mineralization from the West Desert project.

2) Sulfide mineralization is less well liberated within the range of 80 to 100 microns for all 
composites evaluated, and primary grinds in the range of 50 to 65 microns would benefit the 
flotation process.  

 
3) Fine-grained inclusions of copper will likely limit copper recovery as these inclusions are 

typically below re-grind sizes anticipated for the process.  
 
Figure 13.1 and Figure 13.2 show two photomicrographs of the copper-zinc composite evaluated by 
G&T, illustrating the location and occurrence of copper minerals (shown as yellow inclusions in 
spalerite).  Figure 13.1 shows a copper mineral of approximately 25 microns, which should report to a 
final copper concentrate with appropriate re-grinding.  Figure 13.2 shows fine-grained chalcopyrite 
included within sphalerite with a size of approximately 2 to 5 microns, which is likely to report to a zinc 
concentrate.   
 
It is important to observe the high degree of separation of the gangue from the sulfide minerals in the 
photomicrographs.

Mineral (lower left) Included within Sphalerite 

 

 
 
A summary of mineral liberation data is shown in Table 13.2 for the three composites evaluated in the 
test program KM2450 (Shouldice and Pojhan, 2009).  Some of the low liberation data for copper sulfide 
minerals ("Cs") are due to the very low grade of the copper minerals within the samples and the low 
copper to zinc ratios within the samples.

This work index determination characterizes the ore as moderate in terms of hardness or grindability,

13.3.1.3 Flotation Test Results 
 
A substantial volume of flotation metallurgical test work has been completed on the West Desert 
materials.  The following conclusions can be drawn from the test work programs:   
 

1) All of the materials have been shown to be capable of producing high-grade zinc concentrates at 
high recoveries of zinc.   Additional test work looking at optimizing flotation conditions will 
likely improve these excellent results.   

2) The selection of materials for flotation test work is important because large variations are 
observed in test samples, including variations in copper-to-zinc ratios, overall feed grades, and 
overall magnetite grades.  This makes the translation of test results to  mine and mill production 
models open to some interpretation.  

3) Copper recovery is low due to liberation issues as well as inclusions of fine copper minerals that 
appear in zinc mineralization.  Additional work in this area is recommended.   

 
On completion of the open-circuit tests, locked-cycle tests were completed on all three composites to 
determine the metal recovery and the composite grades.  It is the author's opinion that the results of 
locked cycle tests demonstrate the potential of the production of copper and zinc concentrates.  
However, it is also evident that additional metallurgical test work is required to optimize the use of 
primary grinding conditions, reagent conditions, and flotation conditions.  The three locked cycle test 
results for the composite samples used in the project KM2450 (Shouldice and Pojhan, 2009) are shown 
in the Table 13.4.

Open-circuit bench-scale testing to evaluate the recovery of copper and zinc determined that the use of 
zinc depressants, ZnSO4 and NaCN, was essential to control the recovery of zinc to the copper 
concentrate thereby optimizing the performance of the zinc recovery circuit. The open-circuit test work 
also indicated that rougher concentrate regrinds were essential for both the copper and zinc circuits in 
order to optimize the concentrate grades and recoveries. 
 
Detailed concentrate assays indicate that there are payable metals that will be recovered to the 
concentrates, including gold, silver, and indium.  A summary of concentrate assays are shown in Table 
13.5.

13.3.1.4 Magnetite Recovery Test Work 
 
A detailed test work program to evaluate the production of a magnetite (iron concentrate) from the West 
Desert materials was completed at G&T in 2013 as project KM3738 (Pupazzoni and Shouldice, 2013).     
 
The test sample used in the magnetite recovery test work was lower grade than previous test samples in 
terms of copper and zinc and higher grade in terms of magnetite content.  The sample generated for this 
test work incorporated zones of mineralization that were dominated by magnetite zones previously 
outside the proposed mining schedule.   
 
Test work demonstrated the ability to produce iron concentrates with iron grades in the range of 63 to 65 
percent iron at very high iron recoveries.  Iron recoveries seen in the G&T testing for the recovery of 
magnetite was in the range of 96 percent of available iron. 
 
The magnetite recovery process will be placed ahead of the flotation process.  This option was selected 
to take advantage of the high degree of liberation of magnetite as well as the flotation chemistry 
advantages by removing iron minerals from the flotation process.  Iron minerals are known to adversely

affect flotation chemistry by increasing the consumption of zinc depressants as well as increasing the 
consumption of zinc activators.  
 
The removal of iron minerals from the flotation feed has the ability to significantly increase the grade of 
copper and zinc observed in the flotation process. The average magnetite content of the planned mine 
production is approximately 47 percent, and this will result in nearly doubling the copper and zinc 
grades reporting to a flotation process when compared to the plant feed grades.  Significantly better 
flotation chemistry is expected following the removal of magnetite from the flotation feed stream. 
 
13.3.2  Oxide Mineralization Tested by Kappes, Cassiday & Associates 
 
A significant and open-ended resource of oxide zinc mineralization has been defined at West Desert.  
Similar to the methodology used for the sulfide mineralization, a composite of drill-hole intercepts was 
made from previously crushed assay rejects to complete some preliminary tests to determine the 
potential to recover the zinc.  Kappes, Cassiday and Associates ("KCA") completed a zinc mineral 
evaluation program and conducted sulfuric acid leaching tests (Albert, 2009).  
 
The preliminary leach tests indicated that copper, zinc, and indium can be extracted from the oxide 
material using a sulfuric acid leach process.  The acid leaching test results indicated extractions of up to 
95% of the zinc from the ore into solution.  In addition to dissolution of zinc, the leach tests also 
indicated that 78% of the copper and 37% of the indium were extracted from the ore.  There was no 
work completed to determine the process method and resulting recovery of zinc, copper, or indium from 
the acid solution.  
 
Additional test work could be expected to improve upon the KCA test results.  The oxide material could 
be expected to be a source of magnetite, similar to the sulfide resource. 
 
The oxide mineralization has not been addressed in the PEA in this technical report. 
 
13.4 Metallurgical Projections 
 
The preliminary test work completed by G&T, as well as some key results from Cyprus' test work in 
1991, has been used to develop the metallurgical balance for the West Desert project (Table 13.6).  
Given that mine production grades will be variable, it is likely that copper concentrate production will 
be intermittent in nature.  Very high zinc to copper ratios or low copper feed grades would result in the 
cessation of the copper circuit operation.  Additional test work is needed, and key parameters in copper 
recovery need to be better understood before making conclusions about copper circuit performance in 
detail.  Copper concentrate production will be key in recovering precious metals, and additional work in 
precious metal deportment is also required to better understand this issue.  
 
Table 13.6 is a predicted metallurgical balance for the project, based on expected mine production 
grades provided by MDA.

*Magnetic tailings equates to flotation feed. 
 
The copper recovery reported in the metallurgical balance is higher than that reported in test work due to 
the much more favorable (lower) zinc to copper ratio seen in the projected mine production.  Copper 
metallurgical performance is best observed in the locked cycle test results of the copper-zinc composite 
in the G&T KM2450 report (Shouldice and Pojhan, 2009) .  This test sample has a zinc to copper ratio 
of 14.2 compared to a ratio of 9.7 for the planned mine production.  Concentrate grades shown in  Table 
13.6 are consistent with those seen in test work over a number of metallurgical test programs for the 
West Desert project.  
 
Additional metallurgical work with sample materials having metal contents similar to those in the 
proposed mine production is recommended. 
 
13.5 Future Work 
 
These preliminary metallurgical results will provide the criteria and support for additional test work 
required for prefeasibility and feasibility studies.  Sample selection for future programs should use new 
core.  The grinding program will influence the dimensions of the core, depending on what the other 
requirements for the core are.  The selection of samples should also reflect the various types of 
mineralization. 
 
The next stage of metallurgical testing should include: 
 

 Grinding work index – SAG, rod mill, ball mills for various ore types 
 Detailed flotation test work using samples of simulated iron plant tailings 
 Re-grind optimization 
 Thickening and filtration test work 
 Detailed analysis of precious metal deportment in flotation concentrates.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
This section describes an updated NI 43-101-compliant mineral resource estimate for the West Desert 
project.  MDA completed the initial NI 43-101-compliant mineral resource estimate in 2010 (Tietz, et 
al., 2010).  No estimate of mineral reserves has been made for this report. 
 
14.1  Introduction 
 
InZinc requested that MDA update the NI 43-101-compliant resource estimates on the West Desert zinc-
copper-indium-magnetite deposit.  No new drilling has been conducted since the 2010 resource model 
and estimate, but InZinc has collected a significant amount of iron and magnetite analytical data, 
including abundant historical data, which warrants the inclusion of magnetite in the reportable resource.     
 
As of January 2014, 85 drill holes totaling 38,138m exist in the West Desert deposit area.  Because no 
new drilling has been completed since 2009, the discussion of drilling in the 2010 Technical Report has 
been  repeated in this report in earlier sections. The West Desert drill-hole assay database contains 6,503 
zinc assays, 6,505 copper assays, 2,269 indium assays, 4,597 iron assays, and 696 Davis Tube analyses.  
The Davis Tube analyses determine magnetite and magnetite iron percentage.  Other metals are not 
considered to be economically significant by InZinc and therefore were not estimated.   
 
All of the West Desert sample data were used in developing the geologic and mineral models, estimating 
the resources, and determining resource classification.  However, the reported resource estimates for 
West Desert are hampered by having substantially fewer indium and, to a lesser extent, iron analyses 
than zinc and copper.  The relatively few indium assays have resulted in a severe limitation to the 
amount of Indicated material at West Desert.  
  
The work done by MDA for the current resource estimates included assisting InZinc personnel in the 
geological interpretations.  MDA and InZinc worked together on the geologic interpretations on site and 
with access to logs and core.  While MDA constructed the mineral domains, InZinc actively participated 
in checking and offering suggestions for modification.  Those domains were largely defined by the 
geology, in conjunction with sample assay grades that formed the basis of the resource models.  Five 
models were made: 

 Lithologic, 
 zinc, 
 copper,  
 indium, and 
 iron. 

 
MDA made three site visits and audited the data derived from drilling.  Mr. Giles Peatfield analyzed 
QA/QC data for base and precious metals, indium, cadmium, gallium, and germanium (see Section 
12.3.1), and Mr. Peter Ronning, an associate of MDA, analyzed QA/QC data for iron (see Section 
12.3.2).

14.2 Resource Classification 
 
MDA classified the West Desert resources in order of increasing geological and quantitative confidence 
into Inferred and Indicated categories, as defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum ("CIM") in December 2000 and modified in 2005 and 2010, so as to be in compliance with 
NI 43-101.  CIM mineral resource definitions are given below:   
 

Mineral Resource 
Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated 
and Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applied 
to an Indicated Mineral Resource. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than 
an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower level of confidence than a Measured Mineral Resource. 
 
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or 
natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals 
in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity 
of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and 
knowledge. 
 
The term Mineral Resource covers mineralization and natural material of intrinsic economic interest 
which has been identified and estimated through exploration and sampling and within which Mineral 
Reserves may subsequently be defined by the consideration and application of technical, economic, legal, 
environmental, socio-economic and governmental factors. The phrase 'reasonable prospects for 
economic extraction' implies a judgment by the Qualified Person in respect of the technical and economic 
factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction. A Mineral Resource is an inventory of 
mineralization that under realistically assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions might 
become economically extractable. These assumptions must be presented explicitly in both public and 
technical reports. 
 
Inferred Mineral Resource 
 
An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality 
can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but 
not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes. 
 
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all 
or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral 
Resource as a result of continued exploration. Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to allow the 
meaningful application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic 
viability worthy of public disclosure. Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates 
forming the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. 
 
Indicated Mineral Resource 
 
An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape, and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to 



              
                      Technical Report on the West Desert Project Preliminary Economic Assessment, Juab County, Utah

allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and 
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade 
continuity to be reasonably assumed. 
 
Mineralization may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the 
nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such as to allow confident interpretation of the 
geological framework and to reasonably assume the continuity of mineralization. The Qualified Person 
must recognize the importance of the Indicated Mineral Resource category to the advancement of the 
feasibility of the project. An Indicated Mineral Resource estimate is of sufficient quality to support a 
Preliminary Feasibility Study which can serve as the basis for major development decisions. 
 
Measured Mineral Resource 
 
A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with 
confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to 
support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based 
on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes that are spaced 
closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 
 
Mineralization or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as a Measured Mineral 
Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such that 
the tonnage and grade of the mineralization can be estimated to within close limits and that variation 
from the estimate would not significantly affect potential economic viability. This category requires a 
high level of confidence in, and understanding of, the geology and controls of the mineral deposit. 
 

14.3 West Desert Resource Estimates 
 
14.3.1 Procedures 
 
Modeling and estimation of zinc, copper, and indium were completed in 2009 and initially reported in 
the 2010 Technical Report (Tietz et al., 2010); modeling and estimation of iron were performed in late 
2013 and are described here for the first time. 
 
Upon completion of the database validation process, MDA constructed 11 unevenly spaced cross 
sections 25m to 100m apart and looking west at 270°.  The sections were spaced to best fit the existing 
drilling.  One set of sections was made for each of zinc, copper, indium, iron, and lithology.  Drill-hole 
information, including rock type and metal grades, along with the topographic surface were plotted on 
the cross sections.   
 
Quantile plots of zinc (%), copper (%),indium (g/t), and iron (%) were made to help define the natural 
populations of metal grades to be modeled on the cross sections.  The plots were reviewed with all 
metals grouped together, but also with the sulfide evaluated separately from the oxide.

Color-coded assays corresponding to population breaks indicated by the quantile plots along with the 
geological interpretation were used in the creation of distinct mineral domains.  These, in turn, were 
used to control the estimation.  The mineral domains as modeled and drawn on the cross sections are not 
strict "grade shells" but are created using geologic information for defining orientation, geometry, 
continuity, and contacts in conjunction with the grades.  Each of these domains represents a distinct style 
of mineralization with unique statistical characteristics.  These cross sections were sliced to level plan on 
3m intervals to coincide with the block-model block size in that direction.  The 11 sliced sections were 
reinterpreted on 279 3m-separated levels, and these were used to code domain percentages into the block 
model.   
 
14.3.2 Geologic Background  
 
The West Desert zinc-copper-indium-magnetite deposit occurs as carbonate-rock-hosted, magnetite, 
sphalerite, and chalcopyrite-bearing skarn mineralization peripheral to the quartz monzonite intrusive 
basement rock.  Stratabound skarn mineralization is preferentially hosted within thin-bedded limestone 
and minor calcareous siltstone horizons, though proximal skarn does form within the more massive 
carbonate rocks along the intrusive contact.  The extent of the mineralization as currently defined is, on 
average, 830m vertically, 800m along strike, and almost 400m in width in multiple zones.  The deposit 
strikes roughly 270o and dips variably to the north from 40° to 80° but averages 60°.   
 
There are two relatively distinct areas to the West Desert deposit – the Main Zone north of the Juab fault 
and the Deep Zone at depth south of the Juab fault.  Figure 7.5 presents a cross section showing the 
relationship of these areas.  The Main Zone skarn mineralization and enclosing alteration are often dis-
continuous due to disruption of favorable bedding horizons by structural complications and intrusive 
stoping.  Observations to date indicate that magnesian skarn is dominant and that massive magnetite is 
very abundant.  However, some high-grade zinc and copper mineralization occurs within high-sulfide 
skarn with limited or no magnetite content.  The Main Zone does extend to the base of the alluvium, 
where it has been oxidized to a variable depth of between 100m and 200m.  The oxide areas have altered 
metal distributions from the original hypogene mineralization.   
  
The Deep Zone stratabound mineralization is more continuous, and stratigraphic correlations are much 
clearer within the Juab fault footwall.  The stratabound mineral horizons, which can be up to 25m thick, 
dip steeply to the north immediately above the intrusive contact though become less steep with 
increasing elevation.  Significant thickness of mineralization also occurs as sub-horizontal proximal 
skarn along the contact of the quartz monzonite intrusive.  Calcareous skarn predominates within the 
Deep Zone, although magnesian skarn is common.  
 
Sulfide mineralization consists of coarse-grained, brown to reddish sphalerite with lesser disseminated 
chalcopyrite, pyrite, and/or pyrrhotite, with the mineral grade, in general, associated with skarn 
alteration.  In the Main Zone, higher-grade mineralization (i.e., increased sphalerite and/or chalcopyrite 
content) is associated with pervasive magnesian skarn alteration in which all primary textures generally 
have been destroyed and there is often evidence of multiple pulses of alteration/mineralization.  Deep 
Zone sulfide mineralization generally occurs in massive magnetite intercalated with humite ± periclase 
skarn, while the calcareous skarn consisting of grossularite, Fe-rich diopside, and K-feldspar is rarely 
mineralized.  Retrograde alteration, in the form of serpentine or epidote, is common.  Decreasing 
mineralization is generally accompanied by decreasing intensity of skarn development.  In the Deep

Zone, fracture-fillings of magnetite in dolomitic marble are common in proximity to intercalated layers 
of massive magnetite.   
 
Copper grades are not directly proportional to those of zinc, and its distribution typically only partially 
overlaps with that of zinc in any given drilled interval.  However, there appears to be at least a rough 
increase in the Cu/Zn ratio with proximity to the intrusion, and discrete zones of copper enrichment are 
definable.  Indium is associated with zinc, and petrographic work has indicated that it occurs primarily 
in the sphalerite lattice.  However, there is not a direct relationship between zinc grade and indium 
grade, and the highest indium grades tend to occur in mineralization with a zinc grade of between 0.5 
and 5%.   
 
Iron is primarily associated with magnesian/magnetite skarn within the Main and Deep zones.  The Fe-
rich skarn was emplaced before the zinc-copper-indium mineralization, and there is often no direct 
relationship between high-grade iron and the other metals.  The massive magnetite within the Deep zone 
proximal skarn is volumetrically much larger than, and can extend outboard of, the zinc-copper 
mineralization as it has been defined by drilling to date.  
 
14.3.3 Geologic Model 
 
MDA used a combination of lithology, angles to core axes, structural data, and logged sulfide 
percentages to construct a geologic model, which formed the basis for the density model used in the 
estimate and which also guided the zinc, copper, indium, and iron mineral domain models.  While all 
metals are globally spatially related, they are not necessarily locally spatially related, thereby requiring 
separate domains for each metal.    Table 14.1 presents a list of mineral domains and materials defined 
for this model.  The mineral domains for each metal were constructed by MDA but checked for 
reasonableness by InZinc.

14.3.4 Sample Coding and Compositing 
 
The metal mineral-domain polygons were used to code drill samples.  Quantile plots, along with global 
zone statistics and spatial location of higher grades, were made to assess validity of these domains and to 
determine capping levels.  After these analyses, MDA chose to cap a total of 23 samples for zinc, 
copper, and indium, and one sample for iron.  Descriptive statistics of these sample grades by domain 
are given in Appendix B.   
 
Compositing was done to 3m down-hole lengths, honoring each material-type and mineral-domain 
boundary.  The 2m by 2m by 3m blocks inside each mineral domain were estimated using only 
composites from inside their respective domain.  Composite descriptive statistics are presented in Table 
14.2.   
 

 Table 14.2 Descriptive Statistics of Metal Domain Composites 
 

 
 
The iron composites include a domain 9, which consists of the very low-grade drill intervals outside of 
the modeled iron domain.  These composites were used to estimate some dilutionary grade, instead of 
0% Fe, into those blocks which contain zinc, copper, or indium mineralization.

14.3.5 Density 
 
The density values used in the updated resource estimate are based on 427 density measurements 
collected by InZinc from diamond drill core in the West Desert resource area.  The samples were 
grouped according to sulfide concentration, metal domain, and lithology.  Because most of the West 
Desert core is solid and unfractured, no adjustments were made to the mean grades of the measured data. 
 
The density values assigned to the various lithologies and domains are given in Table 14.3.

14.3.6 Resource Model and Estimation 
 
The West Desert resource block model replicates the relatively complex metal distributions and 
geometries.  Because of the rather contorted geometries, two passes using inverse distance to the third 
power techniques were made in the estimate; a long pass to ensure filling in all the blocks and a short 
pass for the Indicated classification.  Indium search parameters were particularly long because of the 
limited amount of analytical data.   
 
Correlograms were made in numerous orientations and with numerous lag lengths but dominantly within 
the plane of mineralization.  The zinc and indium structures are similar.  Iron correlograms have similar 
structure to zinc, although with longer major and semi-major ranges.  Copper correlograms are distinct.  
In all cases, the strike continuity is substantially shorter than the dip.  The estimation parameters are 
given in Table 14.4.

Once the total iron was estimated, the estimated total iron value was converted to percent iron that 
resides in magnetite and to percent magnetite; the latter was used in the determination of cut-off grades 
and also in the Preliminary Economic Assessment.  The conversion used a fixed formula varying by iron 
domain, lithology, and oxide zone.  Those relationships were developed from the relationship found in 
the 640 Davis Tube analyses coded to iron domains.   
 
MDA classified the West Desert resources by a combination of distance to the nearest sample and the 
number of samples, while at the same time taking into account amount of underlying data and 
understanding and use of the geology.  The criteria for resource classification are given in Table 14.5.  
There are no Measured resources within the deposit, primarily due to complexity of the mineralization 
but also due to limited drill data.  The maximum distance criterion for Indicated within the Main Zone is 
less than that used for the Deep Zone due to the greater variability in domain morphology and metal 
grades.  While MDA is confident that the indium zones do continue as modeled, mostly because of their 
relationship with zinc (the only identified location of indium metal is in sphalerite), MDA cannot be as 
sure of the grades estimated due to the many fewer indium assays, and hence the unfortunately small 
amount of Indicated material.  None of these issues deter from the overall confidence in the global 
project resource, but they do detract from confidence in some of the accuracy which MDA believes is 
required for Measured and Indicated resources,  Without the downgrading for indium, the Indicated 
resources would be around two times larger than presently reported.

Because of the requirement that the resource exists "in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction," MDA is reporting the resources at 
approximate economic cutoff grades that are reasonable for deposits of this nature that will likely be 
mined by some combination of open-pit and underground methods but mostly underground.  As such, 
some economic considerations were used to determine cutoff grades at which the resource is presented.  
MDA considered reasonable metal prices and extraction costs and recoveries, albeit in a general sense, 
and dropping it a bit to account for that material that would become economic using internal cutoffs.  
 
There is the potential that a combination of open-pit and underground methods would be optimal.  This 
report assumes that the near-surface oxide material would be mined by open pit, while all of the 
underlying material, which includes copper-zinc-indium sulfides plus magnetite, would be mined by 
underground methods (this material to be mined by underground methods is referred to as "sulfide" 
material in this report).

The West Desert reported resource is summarized in Table 14.6.  Oxide and sulfide resources are 
tabulated separately in Table 14.7.  The stated resources are fully diluted to 2m by 2m by 3m (vertical) 
blocks and are tabulated on a gross metal value ("GMV") cutoff grade of $15 for oxide material 
expected to be mined by open-pit methods and $50 for material to be mined using underground 
methods.  All material, regardless of which metal is present and which is absent, is tabulated.  Because 
multiple metals exist, but do not on a local scale necessarily co-exist, the GMV grade is used for 
tabulation.  Using the individual metal grades of each block, the GMV grade is calculated using the 
following formula: 
 

GMV = (%Zn/100*2204.623) + (%Cu/100*2204.623*3.0) + (In ppm/1000*600.0) + 
(%Magnetite)/100*115.0) 

 
In addition to the individual metal tabulations and the average GMV value, the resource tables all 
include a zinc equivalent ("ZnEq") grade for each GMV cut-off.  The ZnEq grade is calculated using the 
following formula: 
 

%ZnEq = %Zn+ (%Cu*3.0) + (In ppm* 0.027216) + (%Magnetite*0.052163) 
 
The GMV and ZnEq formulas are based on prices of $1.00 per pound zinc, $3.00 per pound copper, 
$600.00 per kilogram of indium, and $115/tonne of magnetite.  No metal recoveries are applied, as this 
is the in situ resource.  
 
Typical cross sections through the West Desert block model showing zinc, copper, indium, magnetite, 
and GMV grades are given in Figure 14.1, Figure 14.2, Figure 14.3, Figure 14.4 and Figure 14.5, 
respectively.    
 
The lower cut-off used for the oxide material ($15 GMV) reflects the potential for open-pit mining 
scenarios for this near-surface material.  Pit cones developed using the stated metal prices, expected 
recoveries, and costs indicate that the great majority of oxide material at the $15 GMV cut-off can be 
mined using open-pit methods.  The 2m by 2m by 3m block size likely understates the dilution expected 
from standard open-pit mining methods, but this block size was used to provide the operator the option 
for evaluating the deposit, either in total or within specific areas, using underground mining methods.  
For evaluating open-pit methods, a more appropriate larger block size and dilution can be easily 
achieved by re-blocking.  The higher cut-off used for the sulfide material ($50 GMV) reflects the 
potential for underground mining scenarios for this deep material.

Checks were made on the West Desert resource model in the following manner: 
1. Cross sections with the mineral domains, drill-hole assays and geology, topography, sample 

coding, and block grades with classification were plotted and reviewed for reasonableness;  
2. Block-model information, such as coding, number of samples, and classification, were checked 

visually by domain and lithology on cross sections and level; 
3. Cross-section mineral-domain volumes to level mineral-domain volumes were checked;  
4. Nearest-neighbor and ordinary kriging models were made for comparison;  
5. A simple polygonal model was made with the original modeled section domains;  and  
6. Quantile-quantile plots of assays, composites, and block-model grades were made to evaluate 

differences in distributions of metals.  

In the end, it is deemed that the resource estimates are reasonable, honor the geology, and are supported 
by the geologic model. 
 
14.3.7 Discussion, Qualifications, Risk, and Recommendations 
 
The detailed work completed by InZinc and MDA on the geologic model, and the data defining the 
model, have resulted in a resource estimate of high quality.  The risk is mostly related to the deposit 
type.  Skarn deposits, such as West Desert, often have relatively complicated and rapidly changing 
grades and geology.  This downside would mostly be alleviated through additional drilling.  The upside 
is clearly dominated by the ability to increase the amount of higher-classification material with an 
increase in indium sample assays.  The relatively small amount of Indicated material within the current 
resource is due to the many fewer samples with indium grades.  An increase in indium sample assays 
would also result in a likely increase in overall indium grade if the tenor of the new sample assays was 
similar to that of the existing assays.  The current high-grade search restrictions used in the resource 
estimate serve to constrain the higher-grade values, resulting in lower indium grades within the Inferred 
material.  Upgrading the classification of material with additional samples would therefore also likely 
increase the indium grade of this same material.  There is also good potential to increase the size of the 
deposit by targeting extensions of mineralization primarily to the east, west, and south.   
 
The analytical coverage and estimation of iron are considered good and certainly deserve higher 
classification than is "allowed" by the less-well-covered indium analyses.  The conversion of total iron 
to magnetite and magnetite iron is based on 640 Davis Tube analyses within the iron domains.  MDA 
used the relationships presented in the Davis Tube data to convert estimated total iron into iron-in-
magnetite and magnetite.  Because there are relatively few Davis Tube analyses, and because the 
relationships between total iron and magnetite are not particularly well correlated, this imparts some 
lack of confidence in the total estimated amount of magnetite.  Having said that, the confidence is 
certainly much higher than what is now represented in the relatively small amount of Indicated 
compared to Inferred material because of the indium.  High iron grades generally have a much stronger 
and more correlated relationship between iron and magnetite, mitigating the potential risk substantially.

16.0 MINING METHODS 
 
Underground mining methods have been chosen for the West Desert project based on the depth of 
potentially mineable mineralization and the selectivity that underground mining allows.  The PEA 
considers mining by sublevel stoping, using both long-hole and transverse mining techniques. 
 
Note that a Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature.  It includes Inferred mineral 
resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied 
that would enable them to be classified as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary 
assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 
economic viability.   
 
Potentially mineable resources have been defined by: 
 

 Defining economic parameters; 
 Calculating the NSR for each block; 
 Drawing polygons to define stopes on cross-sections each 10m (north and south); 
 Building solids from the stope polygons by level; 
 Slicing level solids on 20m sections and flagging individual solids into the block model; 
 Summarizing economics for each individual solid; 
 Flagging stopes with positive values; and 
 Summarizing tonnes and grade for the positive value stopes. 

It should be noted that "potentially mineable resources" are not reserves and do not have demonstrated 
technical and economic viability. 
 
The following sections describe the process in more detail. 
 
16.1 Economic Parameters 
 
Economic parameters have been established to estimate the potential value of the zinc, copper, indium, 
and magnetite in the resource model.  As this is a polymetallic deposit with value available from 
multiple metals, an NSR value has been calculated for each block.  The NSR represents payment for 
concentrates sent off site for further processing and refining.  The NSR considers the metallurgical 
recovery, metal prices, transportation and treatment costs, and penalties that the smelter may charge.  
The NSR is also reduced based on a 1.5% royalty to arrive at the NSR value. 
 
An NSR cutoff value has been determined to select only those resource blocks that could potentially be 
mined at a profit.  The NSR cutoff value reflects costs required to mine and process a block of material.  
Costs included in the NSR cutoff value are based on initial estimates of $30.00/t for mining, $3.38/t for 
expensed development, $15.34/t for processing, and $3.30/t for general and administrative costs.  The 
NSR cutoff was rounded to $50.00 for stope design and scheduling purposes. 
 
Table 16.1 shows the metal prices used in economic calculations and Table 16.2 shows other economic 
assumptions.

Table 16.1 NSR Metal Prices 

 
 

The project's iron concentrate is in the form of magnetite having a 63% iron content and is expected to 
attract a $10/t premium to the Tianjin benchmark iron ore price.  Thus, an iron concentrate or magnetite 
price of $115/t is used in the economic analysis (see Section 22.0). 
 

Table 16.2 West Desert Economic Assumptions 
 

  
 
The metal prices in Table 16.1 and the other economic assumptions in Table 16.2 were used to calculate 
the NSR value for each block.  The NSR for each metal was calculated separately, and then the values 
were added together to obtain a "total NSR."  The NSR for each metal only applied if there was a grade 
estimated and the block was classified as Indicated or Inferred. 
 
NSR calculations use a factor for each metal.  Equation 1 shows the equations used to calculate the NSR 
factors, and Equation 2 shows the equations used to calculate the NSR.

16.2 Stope Definition 
 
Stope design was completed using Surpac© (version 6.6) software.  Stopes were defined by following a 
general design method.  The steps used are: 

 Create a grade shell using an NSR cutoff grade of $50/t; 
 Slice the grade shell on 10m eastings through block centers to create polygons (this created small 

polygons around each block in the grade shell); 
 Expand, merge, smooth, and then shrink the polygons (this created unified polygons representing 

material that could be mined from the $50/t NSR grade shells); 
 Draw mineable shapes on 10m easting sections incorporating 4.5m bottom sills and 16.5m stope 

height (total of 21m between levels or seven 3m block heights);

 Build solids first by level, and then splitting the solids on 20m widths along the eastings; 
 Calculate the total value in each solid, and flag those that make a profit; and 
 Review non-profitable stopes to determine if they could be refined. 

 
The stopes were then summarized for tonnes and grade and used in production scheduling. 
 
16.3 Stoping Methods 
 
Sublevel long-hole stoping methods have been considered for the West Desert mining as they provide 
reasonable cost benefits along with reasonable selectivity based on the deposit.  Long-hole stopes will be 
filled with cemented rock fill to provide support and control potential ground subsidence.  The total 
amount of backfilled stopes will depend on geotechnical requirements. 
 
Two basic types of long-hole stoping have been assumed:  longitudinal and transverse.  The 
mineralization of the deposit is associated with mineralization of various thicknesses.  Longitudinal 
long-hole stopes are mined where the mineralization thickness is less than 20m.  Transverse long-hole 
stopes are used where the mineralization is wider than 20m.  The mining method for longitudinal and 
transverse long-hole stopes is described in Sections 16.3.1 and 16.3.2. 
 
16.3.1 Longitudinal Long-Hole Stopes 
 
Longitudinal long-hole stopes are mined where the thickness of the mineralized zone is less than the 
minimum that can be held open based on geotechnical constraints.  As the geotechnical constraints still 
need study, a 20m thickness was assumed.   
 
The primary development is completed to provide access to the deposit with lateral development parallel 
to the deposit (see Section 16.5 for the description of development).  The start of stoping is to develop 
crosscuts from the lateral development perpendicular into the mineralized zone.  Crosscuts are driven on 
100m centers or less to maintain a maximum length of 100m of open stope.  Future geotechnical studies 
are needed to determine if this distance can be extended further. 
 
Once the crosscut is in place, a 4m-wide and 4.5m-high drift up to 100m long is driven along 
mineralization, becoming the bottom sill.  Angle holes are then drilled into the walls of the sill and 
blasted to widen the sill until any potential ore on the sides has been mined.  This process is called 
slashing, and the resulting material is hauled by LHD from the stope.   
 
Another sill is advanced simultaneously at the top of the stope in the same manner, becoming the top 
sill.  The top sill is used for production drilling and blasting, while the bottom sill is used for mucking 
and haulage.  Figure 16.1 shows the development of the top and bottom sills.

Figure 16.1 Longitudinal Long-Hole Stope Bottom and Top Sill Development 

 
 
Once the sills are in place, production drilling is conducted.  Typically this is done from the top sill, but 
to reduce dilution, this can be done from the bottom sill, and the top sill can be eliminated. 
 
The top sill production drilling starts by developing a slot cut.  The slot cut is essentially a small drift 
round drilled vertically that can be blasted to create a slot from the top sill to the bottom sill.  This is 
required so that the production blasts have an open area to be shot into.  The slot cut will include "burn" 
holes that are large-diameter drill holes drilled with the production drill that do not get loaded with 
explosives.  Then smaller-diameter drill holes are drilled around these, loaded, and shot.  The burn holes 
act as a free surface for the other blast holes to be shot into. 
 
Production drill holes are then drilled around the slot cut and blasted into the slot cut.  Production 
blasting is done periodically as the stope is mucked from the bottom.  Enough material is blasted to keep 
an inventory of a couple of days.  Mucking is done from the bottom sill using remote controlled LHDs, 
and the material is dropped into ore passes.  Production mining from longitudinal long-hole stopes is 
shown in Figure 16.2.

16.3.2 Transverse Long-Hole Stopes 
 
Transverse stoping is done where the mineralization being mined is wider than 20m.  As with 
longitudinal stoping, transverse stoping requires a crosscut to be driven across the mineralization 
perpendicular to its trend, but with transverse stoping, crosscuts are driven every 20m instead of every 
100m.  The transverse stopes are developed to be 20m wide along the strike of the mineralization, and 
cross-cuts are driven the full width of the mineralization.  In order to get the best recovery of the 
resource, transverse stopes are developed to be either primary or secondary.  The primary stopes are 
mined first, leaving secondary stopes between the primary stopes, and when complete, the primary 
stopes are backfilled with cemented rock fill or cemented paste fill.  After the backfill has set to a 
reasonable strength, the secondary stopes are mined up to the backfill.  Figure 16.3 shows the 
relationship of the primary and secondary stopes. 
 

Figure 16.3 Transverse Primary and Secondary Stopes 

 
 
16.3.3 Backfill 
 
Backfill will be required to ensure underground workings are geotechnically stable while reducing the 
need to leave large portions of the resource behind in the form of pillars.  At the time of this technical 
report, detailed geotechnical and backfill studies have not been completed and will be required in the 
future to confirm the parameters to be used for final design work. 
 
This PEA assumes that sufficient support can be created with cemented rock fill such that pillars will not 
be required.  Aggregate will be crushed in a borrow pit on the surface.  The aggregate will be sent down 
a waste raise into the mine, where it will feed into a cemented-rock-fill plant underground.  If applicable, 
some tails may be mixed with the aggregate, potentially reducing the amount of tails directed to the TSF 
and decreasing the cost of aggregates.  The cemented rock fill will be hauled to the stopes by trucks and 
or LHDs as required.   
 
Alternatively, a paste fill could be generated from tailings on the surface and pumped down into the 
mine.  This would require the conditioning of tailings with cement and other additives on the surface and 
pumping of the paste into the underground stopes.  The total tails generated by the project will likely be

much less than required for paste fill.  Thus, to generate enough paste fill, the mine may be required to 
mine, crush, and grind waste material from a borrow pit, which would be costly.  For that reason, paste 
fill has not been used for the PEA; however, it does deserve review in a backfill study. 
 
16.4 Dilution and Ore Loss 
 
Sources of mining dilution and ore loss can be planned or unplanned.  Planned dilution and ore loss are 
due to the design of stope shapes that may capture some internal waste and exclude potential ore.  This 
has been accounted for in the design and geometry of stopes.  The PEA assumes that all material inside 
of the stope designs is processed and cannot be further separated into waste and ore.  Thus, the internal 
waste inside of the designs is internal dilution.  The internal dilution consists of material designated as 
resources that is below the mining or NSR cutoff grade (yet above the resource reporting GMV cutoff) 
and waste material (material that is not classified as resources).  The internal dilution that is considered 
to be part of the reported resource dilutes the stopes with the metal grades from those blocks.  All other 
internal dilution is considered to have zero grades and does not contribute to revenue generation.  The 
total dilution inside of the stope designs is approximately 20%. 
 
Ore loss has been accounted for based on the stope designs.  The reported resource has been reduced 
both by the design and by application of economic criteria.  In all, 68% of the Indicated and 49% of the 
Inferred resource (by tonnes) have been captured by the designed stopes.  This amounts to a total 
(Indicated and Inferred) resource capture of 53% by tonnage.  Because the stope designs concentrate on 
higher-value resources, the resource capture by the designs on a metal content basis is higher.  The stope 
designs incorporate 85%, 71%, 67%, and 53% of the total Indicated and Inferred metal resources of 
zinc, copper, indium, and magnetite, respectively. 
 
During mining, the project will experience unplanned dilution and ore loss.  Unplanned dilution 
commonly occurs from collapsing hanging walls or mining of some backfill materials where stopes are 
being mined against backfilled areas.  Unplanned ore loss will come from shutting off of stopes that are 
over diluted due to collapsing waste into the stope or simply from material left in the stope that cannot 
be efficiently mucked. 
 
At this level of study, no additional unplanned dilution or ore loss has been accounted for.  It should be 
noted that the block model has been "block diluted," so MDA assumes that this dilution will account for 
both the unplanned dilution and ore loss.  Future studies that seek to define reserves should take into 
account unplanned dilution, but they should also use the estimated domains and undiluted resource 
estimates. 
 
16.5 Development 
 
The development design has been completed assuming use of a primary decline for access, a single 
ventilation shaft for ventilation and egress, and a conveyor decline (with a conveyor hanging from the 
back) that can also be used for egress as required.  In addition, ore passes, ventilation raises, ramps 
connecting sublevels, and lateral development have been designed to allow access into and operation of 
the mine.  There have also been areas designed to include equipment shops, warehouses, and a crusher 
room.

Initial development will complete the primary haulage level at the 917m level, approximately 425m 
below the surface.  The main decline, conveyor decline, and ventilation shaft will be connected by 
developing laterals on the 917m level to provide ventilation and secondary egress prior to production.  
At the same time, the crusher room, warehouse, and shop areas will also be developed with additional 
crews working on laterals to link the main haulage ramp to the vent shaft and conveyor decline.

16.5.1 Haulage-Method Selection 
 
A high-level study was completed to determine the best method for haulage of material from the 
underground to the surface.  Options considered included truck haulage, conveyor haulage, or shaft 
haulage.  Truck haulage was eliminated due to: 
 

 Assuming that a dual decline would be required to meet production requirements, there is not a 
distinct capital-cost advantage between the truck-haulage option and conveying; 

 Truck haulage would require additional ventilation to dilute diesel particulates from the air and 
could adversely affect the health and safety of the personnel; and 

 Operating costs for conveying and shaft haulage are significantly lower than truck-haulage costs. 
 
To evaluate the difference between shaft and conveying of material, assumptions for installation and 
operating costs for both systems were made.  These assumptions are shown in Table 16.4. 
 

Table 16.4 Shaft and Conveyor Tradeoff Study Assumptions 

 
 
Note that the first 50m of the conveyor decline were estimated using $4,012/m to account for extra 
support and portal construction costs. 
 
Capital costs considered construction of each system to the 917m level.  In each case, the construction 
would begin in year -2 and last through two years.  A shop, warehouse, and crusher station would be 
located in the vicinity of the load-out system for each option.  The capital-cost estimate for each is 
shown in Table 16.5.

Table 16.5 Shaft and Conveyor Option Capital Estimate 

 

  
 
The capital estimate for the shaft is considerably higher than that for the conveyor system, primarily due 
to the high cost of shaft development and the cost of hoisting systems.  Shaft capital is approximately 
59% higher than the conveying-system installation. 
 
Operating costs of $0.35 and $0.40 were assumed for shaft and conveyor haulage, respectively.  These 
were applied to the life-of-mine process schedule.  The result is a total of $11.9 and $13.6 million 
dollars life-of-mine operating cost for shaft and conveying, respectively.  The total costs, when added to 
the capital cost, is $35.6 and $28.5 million for shaft and conveying, respectively.  Thus, the shaft option 
will require about 25% more total cost over the life of the mine, based on the existing resource. 
 
The sensitivity to the operating cost was examined to determine the cost difference per tonne that would 
be required to make the options financially equal to each other.  Based on the capital assumptions, it 
would require conveying costs to be approximately $0.25/t higher than shaft costs to recover the 
difference through the life of the mine.  This difference does not include discounting.  If a 5% discount 
to the cost streams is considered, then the conveying would have to be $0.40 higher to make the shaft 
more financially attractive. 
 
In addition, InZinc considers the conveyor option to be more flexible with respect to increasing the 
throughput rate in the future.  This can be done by increasing the utilization or increase the drive speed 
of the system. 
 
Thus, for the purpose of this PEA, the conveying option has been selected.  This is based on the 
following considerations:

 Conveyor option provides better economics than truck or shaft haulage; 
 Conveyor option reduces diesel particulates compared to truck haulage; 
 Conveying technologies over the past 15 years have improved, and there has been a broader 

application of conveying in metalliferous mines, making conveying a proven technology; 
 The conveyor system will provide better flexibility for throughput increases in the future; 
 Conveyors provide a high mechanical availability (normally better than 90%); and 
 Maintenance of a conveyor system generally requires less expertise than shaft maintenance. 

 
16.6 Ventilation 
 
MDA has used the basic development to determine a simplified ventilation network.  This network is 
shown in Figure 16.6.  The primary components of the network are the main decline, which is used for 
an intake, the main ventilation shaft, which is used for exhaust, and the conveyor decline, which is used 
for additional exhaust.  The ventilation shaft would be fitted with two 17,000 cubic meters per minute 
fans, both using 1,000hp motors.  These would be connected in parallel, and it is anticipated that only 
one would be used at one time.  This allows for a backup fan system to ensure a good supply of air for 
the mine. 
 
The conveyor decline would be fitted with a single, smaller auxiliary fan capable of about 1,300 cubic 
meters per minute.  The concept with the conveyor decline exhaust is to ensure that, should there be any 
sort of fire within the decline, no smoke would be allowed into the rest of the mine.  The conveyor 
decline would be fitted with an air door so that it could be isolated from the rest of the mine should such 
a situation arise.  This concept also helps to keep dust from the conveyor system from contaminating the 
mine's air. 
 
In addition to the main exhaust fans, auxiliary fans will be used to force air into active working areas as 
needed.  These fans would be capable of moving around 1,000 cubic meters per minute.  
 
The ventilation parameters used here are based on other projects of this size.  Since the mine will have a 
reduced number of trucks used for haulage due to the conveyor system, the ventilation needs should be 
less.  Ventilation studies will be further advanced at the next level of study.

16.7 Geotechnical Considerations 
 
The purpose of this PEA is to examine the value of the mine with the addition of the magnetite 
mineralization.  Medium rock strengths have been assumed for this study.  The bulk of the development 
should be in good dolomite zones within the footwall.  This study has assumed that 3m rounds can be 
achieved on a regular basis and that for the bolting in most areas, normal split-set or swelex style of rock 
bolts with retaining plates will be sufficient for support.  Additional costs have been added to the first 
50m of each decline to account for additional support requirements near the portal. 
 
The mineralized zones should also provide good rock strength and have been assumed to have medium 
strength characteristics.  Longitudinal stopes would be kept to 100m along strike and a maximum of 
20m to 25m wide.  Transverse stopes would have similar restrictions with up to 100m in the thickness 
and 20m to 25m wide parallel to the strike.  Costs assume that some sort of cable bolting will be 
completed in the hanging wall to control dilution due to sloughing of waste from the hanging wall. 
 
The geotechnical parameters need to be confirmed with detailed rock-mechanics studies at the next level 
of study.  
 
16.8 Hydrology 
 
A minimal amount of pumping is assumed for the PEA.  The rock is fairly tight, and the water that is 
generated from the underground will be used in the process plant.  Due to the arid nature of the climate 
at West Desert, additional water required for processing will have to be sought.  Additional hydrology 
and water balances will be provided from detailed hydrology studies working up to a pre-feasibility 
study. 
 
16.9 PEA Potentially Mineable Resources 
 
Table 16.6 shows the potentially mineable resources inside of the stope designs and flagged for mining, 
and includes the reported internal waste.  Resources above cutoff are Indicated and Inferred blocks that 
are above a $50.00/t NSR cutoff within the designs.  Resources below cutoff are Indicated and Inferred 
blocks that are below a $50.00/t NSR cutoff, but are reported as resources (above a GMV cutoff of 
$50.00/t).  Internal waste is material that is not classified as a resource and dilutes the total mineable 
resources using zero grade and metal content.  The total dilution by tonnes is 19.6%. 
 
Figure 16.7 shows a long section of the blocks within the potentially mineable resources along with the 
development.

16.10 Equipment Selection 
 
Equipment requirements were evaluated based on the equipment that would be required for 
development, production, and support.  The equipment list assumes that a contractor would do the initial 
development for the pre-production period.  Equipment to be purchased for the start of production in 
year 1 is shown along with the total life-of-mine equipment requirements in Table 16.7.  The total life-
of-mine equipment includes the initial equipment and replacement equipment.  Replacement for major 
equipment is done approximately every four to five years to maintain availability. 
 
The two-boom jumbos and bolters listed for development will also be used for development for stope 
sills as required.  The development haul trucks will also be shared with production requirements as 
required. 
 

Table 16.7 Underground Equipment Requirements 

 
 
 
16.11 Production Schedule 
 
The production schedule was created using MineSched© (version 8.0) mine-scheduling software.  The 
development and production schedules were integrated to ensure that the development requirements 
were met prior to production in any given area.   
 
The initial development contemplates a contractor providing separate construction crews for each 
decline (main and conveyor) along with a separate crew for the ventilation shaft.  An advance rate of 2m 
per day is used at the start of construction, and then increased to 6m per day after the first three months 
of construction.  This assumes that two 3m rounds per day would be achievable as stable production 
after the initial three months used to establish portals, dumps, and such.

The ventilation shaft would be constructed as a conventional shaft from the top down.  A 4m/day 
advance rate is used for the ventilation-shaft development.  Ongoing development rates would be 
4.5m/day for ramps, laterals, and other drifting once owner mining commences in year 1.  Raise 
development is assumed to be contracted and would be done using either conventional means or using 
raise-boring techniques.  Costs used consider the raises to be done conventionally, and a 4m/day rate is 
used for scheduling. 
 
Production is scheduled based on a 5,000 tonnes per day or 1.8 million tonnes per year for the first two 
years followed by expansion of production to 6,500 tonnes per day or 2.3 million tonnes per year.  Some 
test stoping would be done during the pre-production periods to prove up stoping techniques.  Primary 
production would not start until development of the main decline, conveying decline, and ventilation 
shaft was complete and connection is made with a lateral to provide a secondary egress.  At that time, 
production would start to build stockpiles on the surface and ramp up productivity.   
 
The productivity is assumed to be ramped up so that the first year of processing will be at or near full 
production.  In reality, this will require the construction of the process facilities so that they can be 
commissioned during the last quarter of the pre-production periods.  Table 16.8 shows the life-of-mine 
production schedule for West Desert. 
 
The process production was developed based on the processing parameters provided by International 
Metallurgical and Environmental Inc.  Table 16.9 shows the process production schedule, including 
detail of material sent to the magnetic separator and resulting magnetic tails that are sent through the 
flotation plant.

16.12 Mine Personnel 
 
At the start of mining, the mining contractor will provide the labor and supervision for the construction 
period.  Table 16.10 shows an estimate of the contractor-provided personnel.  An engineering, 
procurement, and construction management ("EPCM") contract will provide for management oversight 
of the contractor during the construction period.   
 
A Mine Superintendent, General Foreman, and Mine Clerk would be brought onto the payroll during the 
pre-production year prior to the start of production.  Additional development and production personnel 
would be brought in at the start of production.  During the peak of production and development, the 
mine will employ approximately 192 people as shown in Table 16.11.  The estimate assumes a 
production and development schedule of seven days per week, 24 hours a day.  The schedule assumes 
two 12-hour shifts per day, with crews working four days on and four days off (thus requiring four 
complete crews for development and production).

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 
 
17.1 Introduction 
 
This section on recovery methods incorporates assumptions, analyses, and findings related to the design 
of a concentrator facility for the West Desert project of InZinc Mining Ltd.   
 
The processing facilities are designed to process 6,500 tpd of underground mine production, which 
translates into approximately 2.4 million tonnes annually.  The processing facilities are capable of 
producing an iron concentrate using magnetic separation equipment, as well as two flotation 
concentrates – copper and zinc.   
 
The proposed processes are traditional, and the technologies are widely used.  Sufficient metallurgical 
test work has been completed using materials from the West Desert project to allow for the completion 
of this preliminary design of a concentrator.   
 
The word "ore" in this section is used in a metallurgical sense and is not intended to imply the results of 
economic analysis.  
 
17.1.1 Summary of Process Description 
 
All of the metallurgical test work completed on the West Desert materials indicate they will be amenable 
to processing using a conventional copper and zinc differential flotation process.  The process flowsheet 
will include crushing and grinding facilities to generate a magnetite plant feed with a nominal P80 of 65 
microns.  Magnetite will be recovered prior to flotation, and on average about 50 percent of the ore mass 
will be recovered as an iron concentrate (magnetite).  The tailings from the magnetite recovery process 
will be thickened and ground in order to ensure that target grinds in flotation are meeting the P80 target 
of 65 microns. A block diagram of the overall process outlined for the West Desert project is shown in 
Figure 17.1. 
    
For ores with sufficient copper to operate an economic recovery process, zinc depressants will be added 
to the grinding mill to minimize zinc recovery to the copper rougher concentrate.  Copper rougher 
concentrate will be reground to 15 microns prior to three stages of copper cleaner flotation to produce a 
concentrate grading 29 percent copper. 
 
Tailings from the copper flotation circuit will be fed to the zinc flotation circuit.  CuSO4 will be added to 
the slurry to activate the zinc (sphalerite) for flotation.  Zinc rougher concentrate will be reground to 35 
microns prior to three stages of zinc cleaner flotation to produce a concentrate grading 55.0 percent zinc. 
 
Concentrates from the flotation process will be thickened and filtered to provide dry concentrates that 
will be shipped to the respective smelters. 
 
The average metallurgical balance for the project is shown in Table 13.6.  The key recovery processes 
are shown in Figure 17.2, Figure 17.3, and Figure 17.4; these process options are typical within industry 
for the process being proposed.

17.3 Concentrator Description 
 
17.3.1 Crushing, Conveying, and Stockpiling 
 
Mine production will be delivered to an underground crushing station by the mine operations group.  
The run-of-mine material will be crushed to approximately 250mm in order to meet the size 
requirements of the milling circuit and effective operation of conveying equipment.   
 
The underground crusher is located approximately 500m below surface.  An inclined conveyor of 
approximately 4.8km in length moves crushed material to a live stockpile located adjacent to the milling 
facilities.  The conveyor system is composed to two conveyors, each approximately 2.4km in length.  
The crusher is sized as a 36 by 48-inch jaw crusher with a closing size of 8 inches.   
 
Crushed material is placed on an 8200t live-load stockpile adjacent to the milling facilities.  The live-
load stockpile allows for approximately 30 hours of storage capacity of mill feed ahead of the process. 
 
17.3.2 Primary and Secondary Grinding 
 
Crushed material will be reclaimed from the live-load stockpile using two apron feeders which discharge 
upon a SAG mill feed conveyor.   The SAG mill feed conveyor moves material from beheath the live-
load stockpile into the SAG mill.  The SAG mill feed conveyor moves 294 tonnes per hour to achieve 
6500tpd throughput at a 92 percent operational availability. 
 
Primary grinding is done in a 22ft diameter by 11ft EGL SAG mill employing a 3000hp drive motor.  
The SAG mill has capacity to carry a 15 percent by volume grinding steel in the form of 150mm forged

steel balls.  Slurry discharge from the SAG mill passes over a classification screen, and the screen 
underflow is transferred to a cyclone feed pump.   
 
The primary classifying cyclone assembly is designed to produce an overflow particle size distribution 
with a P80 of 65 microns.  The underflow from the cyclone classification process is fed to a VTM 3000, 
a vertical stirrred mill with a 3000hp motor.  Discharge from the VTM 3000 is classified in the primary 
cyclone assembly, and the VTM 3000 mill is expected to operate with a circulating load of 250 percent. 
 
The cyclone overflow from the classification cyclone will have a slurry density of 35 to 38 percent 
solids.  Cyclone overflow will be transferred to the magnetite recovery plant. 
 
17.3.3 Magnetic Separation 
 
Ground slurry from the classifying cyclones will be fed to a bank of three magnetic separators operated 
in parallel to generate a rough magnetite concentrate for use in subsequent upgrading.  The magnetic 
separators have been sized as 48-inch diameter by 124-inch long low-intensity (900 gauss) drum 
separators.   
 
Two stages of cleaner magnetic separation are proposed, with each stage of magnetic cleaning 
employing two magnetic separators.  Cleaner magnetic separators are of identical size and operating 
parameters as the rougher stage of the plant.   
 
Large volumes of dilution water are used to remove entrained gangue material from the magnetic 
concentrates.  The tailings from the cleaner stages are moved counter-current within the process to 
provide circulating loads of water and intermediate products.   
 
Tailings from the magnetite plant will report to a thickener to recover water for use in the operation of 
the cleaning stages within the magnetite plant.  The thickener also removes water from the flotation feed 
stream to improve reagent usage in flotation. 
 
Figure 17.2 shows the proposed crushing, grinding, and magnetic recovery flowsheet. 
 
17.3.4 Flotation Feed Preparation 
 
The feed for copper and zinc flotation will be depleted of the magnetic minerals, will be substantially 
reduced in terms of tonnage, and will also be significantly upgraded in terms of copper and zinc grades.  
On average, the flotation feed will be approximately 50 percent of the overall plant feed tonnage and 
approximately twice the copper and zinc content of the overall plant feed.

Flotation feed will be thickened to approximately 40 percent solids in a 60m-diameter conventional 
thickener.  Thickener underflow will be fed to a grinding mill dedicated to preparing feed for flotation.   
This mill is a 1500hp vertical stirred mill operating in conjuction with a cyclone classifier.  Particle size 
distributions for cyclone overflow from the circuit are targeted at 50 to 60 microns.   
 
Lime will be added to the mill in order to maintain pH levels in the range of 9.0 to 10.0.  Reagents will 
be added to the grinding mill to assist in the recovery of copper and the depression of zinc minerals prior 
to the copper flotation process.  Zinc sulfate and sodium cyanide will be added to the mill for 
maintaining zinc depression in the copper flotation stage. 
 
17.3.5 Copper Flotation 
 
The recovery of copper will be completed in a bank of mechanical flotation cells.  The current design 
includes five cells of 20 cubic meter flotation volume.  Expected retention time in copper flotation is 
approximately 16 minutes.   
 
The copper rougher concentrate is upgraded in a single stage of mechanical cleaners using five cells of 2 
cubic meter capacity.  The copper rougher concentrate is upgraded prior to re-grinding to remove 
entrained material and reduce the tonnage sent to re-grinding.  The first copper cleaner stage will also 
receive material from the second copper cleaner.  Tailings from the first copper cleaner will report to the 
zinc flotation circuit.   
 
Concentrate from the first copper cleaner will be re-ground to approximately 15 microns in a 100kW 
stirred-media grinding mill.  
 
Two stages of column flotation cleaning will be used to produce a final copper concentrate.   These 
columns will operating in a counter-current fashion, with concentrates advancing through the process 
and tailings re-circulated to the preceeding flotation stage.  The flotation columns are sized at 2.5ft 
diameter by 30ft tall. 
 
On average the copper circuit will produce 1.7 tonnes per hour of final concentrate.  
 
A flowsheet of the copper recovery process is shown in Figure 17.3. 
 
17.3.6 Zinc Flotation 
 
Feed to the zinc flotation circuit consists of the tailings from the copper recovery circuit.   Conditioning 
of the flotation feed is required to alter the surfaces of zinc minerals and allow the zinc recovery process 
to be completed.   
 
Two large conditioning tanks are included in the design.  These are used to adjust pH levels to 11.0 and 
condition the flotation feed with copper sulfate and xanthate.  Conditioning tanks are currently sized at 
4m diameter and 6m tall, operating with a 5 kW agitator.  The conditioning tanks are operated in series, 
with the first tank having lime and copper sulfate added to the slurry and the second tank having zinc 
collectors added.

The conditioned zinc flotation feed slurry will be fed to a single bank of 20 cubic meter mechanical 
flotation cells.  Eight cells will be installed and represent an approximate retention time of 24 minutes of 
flotation time.   Concentrate from the zinc rougher will be sent to a first zinc cleaner stage employing 
eight cells of 5 cubic meters each.   
 
Zinc first cleaner concentrate will be reground to approximately 30 microns in a 500kW stirred mill, 
operated in conjunction with a classifying cyclone.  The cyclone overflow will be sent the first of two 
flotation columns, which operate as second and third zinc cleaners.  Columns are sized at 2.5m diameter 
and 10m tall.   
 
Tailings from the zinc rougher cells and the first zinc cleaner will be sent to the tailings storage facility. 
 
A flowsheet of the zinc recovery process is shown in Figure 17.4.

17.3.7 Concentrate Thickening and Dewatering 
 
Magnetite concentrates obtained from the final stage of magnetic separation will be very dense and can 
be directly transferred to filtration.  Magnetite concentrates will be directly fed to a belt vacuum filter to 
produce a final filter cake for storage and shipping to market.   
 
Copper concentrate will be thickened to approximately 75 percent solids in a 6m-diameter thickener.  
Flocculant wll be added to the thickener feed to assist in settling the copper concentrate.  Overflow from 
the thickener will be returned to the copper cleaner circuit.  Thickened concentrate will be stored in an 
agitated stock tank prior to filtering in a pressure filter.  A 6m-square pressure filter has been included in 
the design of the plant, which is substantially oversized. 
 
Zinc concentrate will be thickened to approximately 75 percent solids in a 20m-diameter thickener.  
Flocculant wll be added to the thickener feed to assist in settling the zinc concentrate.  Overflow from 
the thickener will be returned to the zinc cleaner circuit.  Thickened concentrate will be stored in an 
agitated stock tank prior to filtering in a pressure filter.  A 60m-square pressure filter has been included 
in the design of the plant.

Concentrates will be stored indoors prior to loading onto highway trucks for transport to market. 
 
17.3.8 Tailings Handling 
 
Process tailings will be pumped to a tailings storage facility, where solids will be allowed to settle and 
water will be reclaimed from the tailings pond to be re-used in the process.  The tailings storage facility 
will be the long-term depository of the process tailings.   
 
Process water will be reclaimed from the tailings storage facility using a barge-mounted pump assembly 
and pumped to a process water storage tank.  Process water will be distributed to various areas with the 
concentrator as needed. 
 
17.3.9 Reagents, Services, and Utilities 
 
Reagents for the operation and control of the flotation process will be prepared, stored, and metered 
from a dedicated reagent area within the concentrator.  Reagents which are received as solids will be 
mixed with fresh water prior to use in the flotation process.  Reagents will be metered to the process as 
solutions using metering pumps.  
 
The plant will be serviced with compressed air, fresh water, and instrumentation air for use in plant 
operation.   
 
The overall process will be monitored using a process-control system, assisting operations with process 
monitoring, process control, and plant operation.  Field instrumentation will be extensive, including 
power monitoring, material flow measurement, equipment status, flotation chemistry parameters, and 
other parameters.   
 
The plant will include an on-stream analyzer to monitor the flotation process.These data will be key to 
understanding metallurgical requirements on a real-time basis. 
 
17.4 Project Power and Plant Consumables 
 
An estimate of power demand for the project is based on a summation of the motor sizes for the various 
equipment and factoring the estimated power demand during operation.  Table 17.3 shows the connected 
motor sizes summed for the various areas of the plant as well as an estimate of the power draw during 
operation.  Power draw was estimated to be 90 percent of connected the motor size.

18.1 On-site Infrastructure 
 
On-site infrastructure considered in the PEA includes a tailings facility, waste dumps, borrow pits, 
electrical distribution, access roads, and buildings. 
 
18.1.1 Tailings Storage Facility  
 
The tailings storage facility ("TSF") was originally designed in a study by Knight Piésold that was used 
for the 2010 PEA and was described in that technical report (Nilsson et al., 2010).  The 2010 PEA 
provided a basic design for the containment of 12.1 million tonnes of tailings material.  The current 
potentially mineable resources will create about 17.3 million tonnes of tailings, thus requiring additional 
storage capacity.  This would be done by either increasing the footprint of the existing design or 
increasing the height.  In addition, some tailings can ultimately be stored underground, which would be 
more desirable; however, detailed studies for the incorporation of tailings into the backfill have not yet 
been completed.  
 
This PEA has relied on the same design concepts as the 2010 PEA.  These design concepts were 
provided in the previous technical report as follows (Nilsson et al., 2010): 
 

"The objective of the TSF design concept was to locate a TSF as close a possible to the deposit 
while minimizing embankment fill requirements.  It was also a requirement to maintain a 150 m 
buffer zone from the Pony Express Road.  The TSF was thus located on the gentle sloping (1 to 
2% grade) ground immediately west of the deposit between the Pony Express Road and the 
main road to the west of the deposit.  The preliminary layout of the TSF included a large 
impoundment footprint, as the volumetric storage efficiency (volume of storage vs. volume of 
embankment fill materials) for TSFs on relatively flat terrain increases as the TSF footprint 
increases.  The embankment fill materials (and costs) are comparatively lower than for 
facilities with smaller footprints and higher embankments. 
 
The preliminary layout for the TSF was to provide containment for 12.1 million tonnes of 
tailings solids at an assumed dry density of 1.4 tonnes/m3.  The TSF has been located on the 
flats to the west of the deposit where the elevation ranges from approximately 1,324 m to 1336 
m (Figure 19.8).  The ultimate elevation of the TSF embankments is approximately 1,340 m and 
has embankments that range in height from 16 m at the western corner of the facility to 
approximately 4 m along the eastern side of the TSF. 
 
The TSF covers an approximate area of 1.1 Mm2 and includes a low permeability basin 
liner/subgrade material with a basin underdrain for seepage control.  The embankments were 
assumed to be constructed using the downstream construction method with a 3H:1V upstream 
slope to facilitate placement and compaction of the low permeability basin liner, and a 2H:1V 
downstream slope.  The embankments are homogeneous dams with appropriate filter zones to 
prevent internal erosion of the embankment fill materials in the event the liner system if 
damaged.  The embankments were assumed to be constructed using local borrow materials.

The low permeability basin liner/subgrade material was assumed to be appropriate for seepage 
control at this stage.  This should be revisited once the tailings geochemistry is better 
understood. 
 
The tailings were assumed to be conventional slurry tailings with a solids content of 30%, as 
per discussions with Lithic resources.  The tailings were discharged from the embankment crest 
around the impoundment to maximize the tailings distribution within the TSF to improve the 
storage efficiency.  A small supernatant pond was assumed to be located on the western side of 
the facility for the PEA. 
 
The starter dam sized for containment of two years of operations at the full throughput.  A mill 
ramp-up period was not considered for the PEA." 

 
18.1.2 Waste Dumps  
 
Three waste dumps have been designed to provide containment of development waste.  Two of these 
dumps are outside of the portal entrances for both the main and conveyor declines.  These would be used 
to store initial waste material created during construction of the declines as well as to develop pads 
outside of each portal for staging of equipment and supplies used in the portals. 
 
A third waste dump has been designed to contain additional development waste just to the north of the 
conveyor decline.  This would be used for waste hauled out of the main decline by trucks as required.  In 
addition, it may be practical to crush some of the waste underground and convey it up the conveyor 
decline.  
 
The three waste dumps have been designed to hold approximately 1.5 million tonnes of waste.  
However, it may be beneficial to use some of this waste as backfill material, running it through the 
aggregate plant.  The waste dumps have been included at this time to provide an overall potential 
footprint for the project.  Additional studies in the future may refine the use of waste material throughout 
the site. 
 
18.1.3 Borrow Pits 
 
This PEA assumes that tailings will be stored on the surface along with development waste.  Thus, there 
will be a requirement for aggregate to be mined for use in backfill.  The material would be mined from a 
surface borrow pit and delivered to the aggregate plant for crushing and subsequent delivery 
underground for the backfill of stopes. 
 
For the purpose of this PEA, a rough design has been made, placing the borrow pit just to the north of 
the main decline.  This design would provide approximately 20 million tonnes of backfill material.  At 
this time, the quality of this material is not known, and additional studies are required. 
 
It may be possible to enhance the economics of the project if the borrow pit is designed around the oxide 
portion of the West Desert deposit.  Additional studies would be required to determine how zinc and 
copper would be extracted from the oxide material; however, it may be possible to run the oxide 
portions of magnetite through the magnetic separator to provide additional revenues and to use material

classified as waste in and around the oxide resource for backfill in the underground mine.  This will be 
the subject of additional studies in the future. 
 
18.1.4 Electrical Distribution 
 
Electrical power will be supplied underground, typically at 4,160V, using a ring system through the 
main and conveyor declines.  Power centers with step-down transformers will be located to provide 
power to drills, bolters, fans, and pumps in active mining areas and to fixed facilities including the 
maintenance shop, crusher room, and warehouse. 
 
The annual power consumption during a typical year of full mining is estimated to be about 54,000 
MWh.  Ventilation, dewatering pumps, and crushers will be the primary consumption of power 
underground. 
 
Surface power will be distributed from a substation located near the mill.  The primary usage will be for 
processing on the surface.  The process power requirements have been defined based on the equipment 
required for the process facility, which has approximately 12,600 hp of requirements.  Additional power 
will be distributed around the site as needed for the aggregate plant, warehouse, and other buildings. 
 
18.1.5 Access Roads 
 
Primary access to the property is via theBrush Wellman Road, which is a paved road leading northwest 
from Delta, Utah.  This leads to a gravel public road, which currently crosses the property between the 
TSF and the plant.  This portion of public access would be re-routed around the west side of the property 
and a portion of the old public access would be used to access the site. 
 
Additional roads would be built inside of the property to access areas as needed. 
 
18.1.6 Buildings and Security 
 
Various buildings would be constructed around the site.  Most of these would be pre-fabricated 
buildings where applicable.  The buildings would include: administration, safety and security, 
warehouse, mine and mill operations and dry facility, and a small office within the explosives storage 
facility.   
 
In order to keep the public safe and to secure the operation, a security fence would be constructed 
around the entire facility.  The fence will extend around both the surface and underground development.  
The fence will have a main gate at the southern end of the project near the safety and security building to 
control access to for employees and visitors. 
 
Additionally, scales will be maintained near the main entrance and controlled from the safety and 
security building.  This will allow for the weighing of both incoming supplies and outgoing product.

18.2 Off-site Infrastructure 
 
This PEA contemplates transport of three concentrates: magnetite, zinc, and copper.  All three 
concentrates would be loaded into over-the-road trucks on site. Copper concentrate would be hauled 
directly to the Kennecott smelter in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Zinc and magnetite concentrates would be 
hauled by truck to an off-site train load-out facility.  From there, zinc concentrate would be loaded onto 
railcars for transport to the Teck smelter in Trail, B.C.  Magnetite concentrate would be loaded onto 
railcars and delivered to a port facility near San Francisco (Stockton, Richmond, or Oakland), from 
which it would be shipped to Tianjin, China.  The off-site load-out facility required for zinc and 
magnetite concentrates could be located near Delta, Utah, although an alternative and equidistant site 
may be Wendover, Utah. 
 
Final modes of transportation and location of any related off-site facilities are subject to further study 
and negotiation.  It may be possible to find domestic markets for the magnetite within the U. S., which 
would further enhance the economics of the project through possible savings on transportation costs. 
 
For the purpose of this PEA, costs have been added for transportation based on the tonnage of 
concentrate shipped and include leases for certain off-site facilities.

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
 
The West Desert project is expected to create three main products: 
 
1. zinc concentrate with high indium content 
2. copper concentrate with high gold and silver content 
3. magnetite (iron) concentrate. 
 
InZinc has no current sales contracts in place and has not engaged a concentrate specialist.  However, 
large and liquid markets that are global in extent exist for all three products and are routinely reported on 
in the press. 
 
The metals prices (except indium) used in this PEA are the average of long-term price forecasts 
periodically published by a number of large banking and financial institutions including RBC, CIBC, 
Scotia Bank, and BMO, among others.  In the case of indium, there is no long-term forecast available, 
and a price well below the spot price of $750/kg (March 17, 2014) was chosen.  Metals prices used in 
this study are shown in Table 19.1. 
 

Table 19.1 Metal Prices Used for the PEA 
 

Zinc ($/lb) Copper ($/lb) 
Iron Concentrate 

($/t:  62% CFR Tianjin) * 
Gold ($/oz) Silver ($/oz) Indium ($/kg) 

1.00 3.00 105 1,300 21 600 

* The project's iron concentrate is magnetite and is expected to attract a premium of $10.00/t; thus a price of 
$115/t for magnetite is used payable in Tianjin (see discussion on magnetite concentrate in Section 19.3). 
 
19.1 Zinc Concentrate 
 
Zinc concentrates are produced at a large number of mines and treated at a variety of smelters and 
refineries around the world.  The overall market for these concentrates is expected to be significantly 
and positively impacted by the closure of a number of large, long-lived mines that have exhausted their 
reserves.  Estimates of the net decrease in global mine production over the next two years are in the 
range of 1.5 million tonnes of contained zinc (Teck Resources Ltd., 2014).  At the same time, zinc 
consumption in both China and the rest of the world is projected to continue increasing. 
 
The zinc concentrates produced at West Desert are expected to be readily marketable in view of their 
high zinc content, high levels of indium, and the lack of penalty elements.  For the purpose of this study, 
it is assumed that concentrates would be shipped to the Teck smelter in Trail, B.C. 
 
Smelter terms agreed to between Teck and Korea Zinc serve as an unofficial benchmark for longer-term 
contracts and are generally set early in the year.  In 2013, this rate was set at $210.50 per tonne at a basis 
zinc price of $2,000/t (Reuters.com, 2013a).  An escalator clause allows for increases of 6% for a zinc 
price between $2,000 - 2,500/t, by 5% for a price between $2,500 - 3,000/t, 2% for a price between 
$3,000-3,500/t and flat thereafter.  A de-escalator clause would decrease the fee by 2% for a zinc price 
from $1,500 - 2,000 and flat thereafter.

Notwithstanding the above, individual smelter term agreements will depend on the quality of the 
concentrate.  In addition, many Chinese smelters do not have long-term contracts, in which case spot 
treatment charges are in effect.  At the time the Teck-Korea Zinc agreement was announced in 2013, 
spot charges were significantly lower, in the range of $120-130 per tonne. 
 
Indium is present in West Desert mineralization at unusually high levels, and analysis has shown that it 
is contained entirely as a trace constituent in sphalerite, albeit in amounts of up to 8% by weight.  As a 
result, the majority of it reports to the zinc concentrate, although minor amounts are found in the copper 
concentrate where it is almost certainly associated with low levels of sphalerite impurities. 
 
Traditionally, indium credits were not paid in third-party smelter contracts.  In part, this related to low 
prices, low demand, and because many mine operators were not aware of its presence.  With the 
significant increase in indium price and consumption due to its essential requirement in the manufacture 
of flat-screen display units, this situation may be changing.  At least one contract, one between 
Glencore-Xstrata and Alexco, has been publicly acknowledged to pay an indium credit (Canadian 
Mining Journal, 2010).  The presence of high levels of indium in concentrate will certainly be a factor in 
the negotiation of smelter contracts for West Desert; thus, a net economic benefit to the producer could 
be realized even if payment for indium is not explicit.  Finally, many mining companies such as Teck, 
Nyrstar, and Votorantim smelt their own zinc concentrates and operate indium recovery circuits.  
Accordingly, indium at West Desert is expected to provide an economic benefit to the project. 
 
19.2 Copper Concentrate 
 
Copper concentrates are produced at a large number of mines and treated at a variety of smelters and 
refineries around the world.  The copper concentrates produced at West Desert are expected to be easily 
marketable in view of their good copper content and payable levels of silver and gold, as well as the lack 
of penalty elements.  For the purpose of this study, it is assumed that concentrates would be shipped to 
the Kennecott smelter in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
 
The terms for a number of contracts between large copper producers and smelters for processing of 
copper concentrates are published each year and, although they vary somewhat, serve as unofficial 
benchmarks.  Freeport McMoRan recently agreed with the largest smelting group in China, Jiangxi 
Copper Company, to treatment and refining charges of $92 per tonne and 9.2 cents per pound for copper 
concentrate shipments in 2014 (Reuters.com, 2013b). 
 
19.3 Magnetite Concentrate 
 
The sale of a magnetite concentrate from the West Desert project can be supported by three principal 
market factors: 
 
1. continuing growth in demand for steel 
2. continuing growth in projected global steel production, led by China 
3. desirability of high-quality iron feed consisting of concentrates with high Fe grade, magnetite 

mineralogy, and low or negligible levels of impurities.

Global markets for iron concentrates are about 2.1 billion tonnes annually (Bank of America and Merrill 
Lynch, 2012).  Market research suggests a trend towards higher demand for quality iron concentrates, 
particularly in China, as higher energy costs and new environmental policies are implemented. 
 
For the purpose of this study, it was assumed that magnetite concentrates would be shipped to Tianjin, 
China.  However, it is important to note that a number of domestic steel producers and/or re-melters 
exist in the Midwest and western U.S. and could provide a market for these concentrates, possibly 
reducing shipping costs.  This potential will be investigated in detail in future studies. 
 
Iron ore is currently priced based on certain benchmarks depending on the quality of the ore.  The Platts 
IODEX marker for 62% iron sinter fines, cost and freight ("CFR") Tianjin, China, is expected to apply 
to West Desert concentrates and has specifications as shown in Table 19.2. 
 

Table 19.2 Platts IODEX Specifications 
 

Sinter Fines Reference Maximums 
Size (for hematite ores) granular size below 10mm for at least 90% of the cargo, 

with maximum of 40% below 150 micron

Minimum lot size 20,000 metric tonnes 
Pricing Point CFR Tianjin port (China) 
Timing Loading within 4 weeks of transaction 
Payment At sight 
Currency and Units US$ per dry metric tonne 

 
Concentrates exceeding this standard of quality may attract premiums.  In general, the value of these 
premiums is linked to steel demand and available steel production capacity.  Particularly in periods with 
low available capacity, a higher grade of feed increases the value of the iron in the feed to the furnaces, 
and more iron can been produced per unit of feed.  In addition, a higher-quality feed is important where 
energy or environmental costs are significant, since it results in less slag that has to be disposed of and 
less energy required per unit of steel.  The latter is particularly true of magnetite ores, which are more 
easily reduceable.  Already significant in Japan and Korea, these considerations are growing in 
importance in China as well. 
 
For concentrates with higher grades, a premium is applied per percentage point above 62% Fe.  
Historically, this premium has fluctuated between $1.50 and $9 per tonne per extra percentage point.  
The West Desert concentrates are expected to average 63% Fe.  The current long-term projection (RBC 
Capital Markets, 2013) for a grade premium is $4 per percentage point, and therefore the West Desert 
concentrates are projected to receive a $4 per tonne premium.  There is also a premium for magnetite 
mineralogy, as it generates heat in the steel-making process and requires less energy to reduce.  This 
premium, for which West Desert concentrates are expected to qualify, has recently been about $5 per 
tonne (Tetra Tech, 2013).

Finally, there are penalties for contaminants such as sulfur, phosphorus, and alumina above the 
benchmark rates noted in Table 19.2.  Magnetite concentrates produced at West Desert contain low 
amounts of these elements and are not expected to incur penalties.  In addition, a relatively high content 
of magnesia in the West Desert concentrates may be attractive to buyers as it could reduce the amount of 
dolomite flux required in the smelting process.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY 
IMPACT 

 
InZinc retained Enviroscientists, Inc. of Reno, Nevada, to provide an independent assessment of the 
permits and approvals that would be required for continued exploration and any subsequent construction 
and operation of a mine at the West Desert project.  Enviroscientists specializes in assisting natural 
resource development industries in the southwestern U.S. with permitting requirements with a focus on 
the evaluation of environmental impacts.  Most of the material in this section is summarized by InZinc  
from Enviroscientists, Inc.'s May 19, 2013 letter report to InZinc (Enviroscientists, Inc., 2013), with 
additional information from other recent studies (RPA, 2013). 
 
20.1 Environmental Studies 
 
InZinc currently holds exploration permits from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Utah 
Division of Oil, Gas and Mining, as well as a Small Mine Permit from the latter agency.  No 
environmental studies were necessary for these permits nor have any been carried out by InZinc on the 
project to this point.  Since the project is at the level of a Preliminary Economic Assessment, the exact 
details of any further development have not been finalized.  However, the current study indicates that 
development activities may include: 
 

1. underground mining; 
2. minor open pit mining; 
3. ore processing using a flotation process; 
4. spent-ore disposal in a tailings impoundment; 
5. ancillary activities; and  
6. water production from a groundwater source. 

 
The permitting process mandated by the above activities would require that the following environmental 
studies and baseline data collection beconducted: 
 

1. cultural resource surveys (anything over 50 years old is considered a cultural resource); 
2. wildlife surveys for threatened or endangered species; 
3. botanical surveys for threatened or endangered species and vegetation community analysis 

(limited to the blooming season); 
4. geochemistry for waste and ore characterization; 
5. groundwater characterization; 
6. soil assessment; and 
7. air quality assessment. 

 
20.2 Permitting 
 
The West Desert deposit is located on undeveloped fee land, and although the property includes some 
peripheral federal lands and a state mineral lease, any development related to mining is expected to be 
located on existing fee land or lands converted to that status.  As a result, the majority of the regulatory 
requirements would be administered at the state level.  The main State of Utah agencies with jurisdiction 
include: 



              
                      Technical Report on the West Desert Project Preliminary Economic Assessment, Juab County, Utah

May 2, 2014 Print date:5 May 2014 4:00 

DOGM (Division of Oil, Gas and Mining) provides oversight and, in coordination with the State of 
Utah School and Institutional Trust Land Administration ("SITLA") and the U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management ("BLM"), has approval authority for mine and reclamation planning as well as 
financial assurance and reclamation monitoring.  
 
DEQ (Department of Environmental Quality) issues permits for the protection of air and water 
quality. 
 
DWR (Division of Water Rights) regulates the appropriation and distribution of water in the State 
of Utah through the Office of the State Engineer. 

 
In addition to these key permitting agencies, there are a number of additional State compliance programs 
including those pertaining to drinking water, waste disposal, and safety. 
 
The following major environmental permits would be necessary from the state of Utah to construct and 
operate the project: 
 

1. Large Mine Operating Permit; 
2. Ground Water Discharge Permit; 
3. Pond Construction Permit; 
4. Dam Permit; 
5. Air Quality Permit, and 
6. Water Rights.  

 
Large Mine Operating Permit ("LMO") 
 
The LMO is a complex permit administered by DOGM.  LMO's are required for mines that exceed 10 
acres of surface disturbance and include a detailed plan of operations, rock geochemical 
characterization, a reclamation plan, and financial assurance requirements.  InZinc currently has a Small 
Mine Operating Permit ("SMO") allowing a surface disturbance of up to five acres.  The project is 
currently bonded in the amount of $76,000 in fulfillment of the requirements for the SMO in 
conjunction with those for a BLM Exploration Permit.  The amount of additional financial assurance 
necessary for a mining operation would be stipulated in the LMO. 
 
Ground Water Discharge Permit ("GWDP") 
 
The GWDP is administered by the Water Quality Division ("DWQ") of DEQ and must be completed for 
mining and processing activities and any water management system.  The GWDP application includes 
the requirement of a construction permit for any impoundments designed to hold process water or 
dispose of wastewater by evaporation. 
 
Pond Construction Permit 
 
Pond construction permitting is regulated under UAC R317-1-2, and a construction permit is acquired 
through the DWQ.  Once the pond design plans are approved, the construction permit will be issued.

May 2, 2014 Print date:5 May 2014 4:00 

After the construction permit has been approved, construction must commence within one year unless 
otherwise extended by the DWQ. 
 
Dam Permit 
 
The State Engineer has the authority to regulate dams in Utah.  Dams are classified according to hazard, 
size, and use.  Requirements for a dam to be approved by the State Engineer include that the dam 
impounds more than 20 acre-feet of water and does not constitute a threat to human life. 
 
Air Quality Permit (Approval Order ("AO")) 
 
The AO is administered by the DEQ's Division of Air Quality ("DAQ").  An air quality impact 
assessment would be developed to assess the impacts of the project on the air quality of the surrounding 
area and would be used for the analysis in the Air Quality Permit.  A complete emission inventory of all 
the sources would be based on the planned operational configuration and operational parameters and 
hours.  The inventory would quantify criteria pollutant as well as hazardous air pollutant emissions.  
Modeling would use a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") approved model (AERMOD).  It 
is assumed that the project would not meet the DAQ's definition of a major source of air pollutants 
which would require extra measures. 
 
Water Rights 
 
InZinc currently owns the water rights for 10 acre-ft in the project area.  Application to the DWR for 
additional usage would be made as necessary. 
 
Federal permits and approvals necessary for the construction and operation of the West Desert project 
are likely to be limited.  Regulatory programs to which West Desert would be subject include the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives administered explosives program, the EPA for a Title V 
air permit in the event that it was necessary, Mine Safety and Health Administration facility registration 
and safety programs, and potential compliance and/or permits from the Federal Communications 
Commission for on-site communication systems. 
 
Table 20.1 summarizes the permits most likely to be required for development of the West Desert 
project.

20.3 Local Consultation 
 
A cultural study undertaken by the BLM as part of their exploration permitting process showed no 
traditional Cultural Properties to exist in the project area, and no other concerns have been expressed by 
other parties to date.  All residents in the region are familiar with the mining history of the property 
comprising the West Desert project, which dates back to the late 19th century.  A number of the local 
residents in the nearby ranching communities of Callao and Granite Ranch, Utah have been employed 
by or have supplied rental equipment to the project during past exploration programs and are familiar 
with the project.  They would continue to be advised of the project's status through any development of 
an LMO Permit. 
 
20.4 Mine Closure Requirements 
 
The goal of the project's reclamation plan would be to return the site to a landscape comparable to the 
surrounding area that supports an ecosystem as close to the pre-mining site ecosystem as possible.  All 
infrastructure installed by InZinc would be removed from the project site.  Side slopes on disturbed 
ground would be sloped and contoured.  Growth media from topsoil stockpile areas would be used as a

final cover over any reclaimed dumps and other re-contoured areas.  All areas would be re-seeded with a 
State of Utah-approved seed mixture.  Once acceptable water quality is verified, the water in any process 
ponds would be used to irrigate reclaimed areas within the project site.  Any sediment-control structures 
that are necessary would be built to minimize erosion of the reclaimed areas.

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
 
Capital and operating cost estimates have been made for the West Desert mining project based on 
vender budgetary quotes, estimation guides, and benchmarking with similar projects.  The cost estimates 
are considered to be within a level of accuracy of +/- 30%. 
 
21.1 Capital Cost Estimate 
 
Capital cost estimates have been made for the mine, process plant, and facilities.  The total capital is 
summarized in Table 21.1. 
 

Table 21.1 Project Capital Cost Estimate 

 
 

 
21.1.1 Mine Capital Costs 
 
Mining capital includes the cost of underground development, mobile mining equipment, and other mine 
equipment.  Table 21.2 shows the mine capital estimate. 
 
Development capital is based on the cost for construction of mine development required to achieve the 
production schedule.  Costs have been based on estimation guides and benchmarking with other 
projects.  Pre-production development (years -1 and -2) uses contract mining for development of the 
ventilation shaft and the main and conveyor declines, and as such, a 30% increase in costs was added for 
contracted development.  The total development cost is estimated to be $105.4 million for the life of the 
mine. 
 
Mine mobile equipment is purchased when owner mining starts in year 1 and includes the purchase of 
equipment as per Table 16.7 (Mine Equipment Requirements).  The total cost for mobile equipment is 
estimated to be $47.4 million through the life of the mine. 
 
Other mine equipment includes surface equipment, light vehicles, underground pumping equipment, 
electrical substations, explosives magazines, and ventilation fans.  A total of $3.6 million is estimated 
for other mine capital through the life of the mine.

Table 21.2 Mine Capital Estimate 

 
 
 
21.1.2 Mill Capital Costs 
 
Milling facility capital includes the cost of plant site development, processing equipment purchase, 
equipment installation, and the construction of structures to house the milling equipment.  Table 21.3 
shows the mill capital estimate for the West Desert project.  Overall capital estimates for the milling 
facility total $123.1 million, exclusive of contgency or owner's costs. 
 
The milling facility is costed based on process capacity of 6,500 tpd, producing a magnetite iron 
concentrate, copper concentrate, and zinc concentrate.  Capital costs were developed by obtaining quotes 
for key items in the equipment list, as well as deriving some cost estimates from comparable projects.  
Installation costs were estimated using a factor of 40 percent of the equipment purchase price.  Wide 
variations were seen in equipment quotes, and some equipment costs were estimated using the higher 
quoted costs in the interest of maintaining a conservative approach to the estimation process.   
 
Volume estimates for excavation and site preparation, concrete volumes, and structural steel tonnage 
were based on comparable project requirements, and comparable pricing to continental U. S. projects 
was used to determine contributions to the project costs. 
 

Table 21.3 Mill Capital Cost 

 
 
Included within the capital estimate for the milling facility is an estimate of first fills for grinding media 
within the grinding mills.  This estimate does not contain sustaining capital for the milling facility at this 
time, and it is thought to be minimal.

21.1.3 Other Capital Costs 
 
Other capital cost estimates include project development, facilities, tailings, indirect and EPCM, and 
contingency.  The project development costs cover delineation drilling, sampling, and assaying from 
underground to better define the stopes to be mined. 
 
Facilities cost estimates includes access roads, water storage and distribution, assay laboratory, shop, 
and warehouse.  Note that electrical distribution on the surface has been budgeted for in the processing 
capital, and underground electrical distribution is budgeted for in the mining capital. 
 
The tailings facility capital includes $12.3 million for initial construction of the tailings facility along 
with $20.9 million of sustaining capital for future expansion of the tailings facility. 
 
Indirect and ECPM costs are calculated based on 20% of the total capital with the exception of working 
capital.  A contingency has been added to the estimate as 15% of the total capital cost, also excluding 
working capital.  The cash-flow contains $18.9 million in working capital as a charge in year 1.  This 
amounts to three months of production costs during the first year, and the capital is returned in the cash 
flow at the end of the mine life. Other Capital Costs are summarized in Table 21.4. 
 

Table 21.4 Other Capital Costs 

 
 
21.2 Operating Cost Estimate 
 
Operating costs have been estimated for the life of the mine.  All operating costs prior to production in 
year 1 have been capitalized.  Total life-of-mine operating costs and cost per tonne are summarized in

21.2.1 Mine Operating Costs 
 
Mine operating costs have been developed using first-principal costs and comparing those with recently 
published costs for comparable projects.  A basic stope was assumed measuring 25m long by 20m wide 
and 21m high.  The costs were broken down into development of the sill, hanging wall support for cable 
bolting, stope production, and backfilling.  Equipment and labor costs were based on operating two 
shifts at 12 hours per shift and assumed that 1.5 hours of each shift were spent on startup, shutdown, and 
break time. 
 
Equipment operating costs assume 83% efficiency and are based on the hours required to achieve the 
production schedule.  The mine operating costs include parts and maintenance based on the equipment 
hours used, including maintenance labor.  Labor rates for maintenance and operators are based on 
published wages and recent projects.  Labor costs include a 40% burden to account for employee 
benefits and include an average overtime of 21%. 
 
Primary consumables include fuel estimated at $3.00 per gallon and bulk explosives at $1,200 per tonne 
of explosives (includes explosives and delivery to site).  Electrical costs are estimated using $0.08/kWh. 
 
Other mining costs include utilities, ventilation, mining general costs, and engineering and geology and 
expensed development.  The expensed development is based on 34m of attack ramp per stope at a cost 
of $2,500 per meter. 
 
Table 21.6 shows the breakdown of the mine operating cost estimate. 
 

Table 21.6 Mine Operating Cost per Tonne Estimate 

 
 
 
21.2.2 Mill Operating Costs 
 
Mill operating costs have been developed using first principles, based on the results of test work specific 
to the West Desert project, as well as operating staff requirements for the described process flowsheet.  
The expected operating costs for the milling facility is shown in Table 21.7.   
 
The milling facility will employ 72 staff on a full-time basis, including six people in a staff role and 66 
employees as hourly paid workers.  The average burdened wage cost is estimated to be $89,000 per year 
for the operation, excluding overtime allowances.

Reagent consumptions are based test-work findings and are factored to reflect the fact that significant 
tonnage is removed from the flotation process stream by the production of a magnetite concentrate.  Mill 
consumables tonnages are estimated to be 9,813 tonnes annually, approximately 70 percent of it coming 
from the Salt Lake area, providing a significant freight cost savings to the project.   
 
Power costs are estimated based on a $0.08 per kWh pricing.  Power demand is estimated to be 10.3 
MW, including conveying, crushing, grinding, flotation, and dewatering.

Tailings operating costs have been assumed to be $0.25/tonne based on previous work.  This accounts 
for costs involved with pumping of tailings and water management at the tailings facility. 
 
Administrative costs have been estimated based on the costs of administration of personnel, supplies, 
legal, outside services, buildings and utilities, light vehicles, and other general expenses.  The general 
and administrative cost estimate is shown in Table 21.8.  Personnel costs include a 40% burden for 
employee benefits.  Hourly personnel costs include 21% overtime wages.

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 
The economic analysis includes operating and capital costs, revenues, and associated tax treatments 
based on an annual schedule.  This PEA has been developed to be NI 43-101 compliant.  Note that a 
preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature.  It includes Inferred mineral resources that 
are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied that would 
enable them to be classified as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment 
will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability.   
 
22.1 Economic Parameters 
 
Metal prices have been based on long-term pricing provided by InZinc.  These prices are discussed in 
the section on marketing and contracts (Section 19.0).  The metal prices used are: 
 

 $1.00 per pound of zinc; 
 $3.00 per pound of copper; 
 $600 per kg of indium; and 
 $105 per tonne of 62% Fe iron concentrate.  

 
The project's iron concentrate is in the form of magnetite having a 63% iron content and is expected to 
attract a $10/t premium to the Tianjin benchmark iron ore price.  Thus, an iron concentrate or magnetite 
price of $115/t is used in the economic analysis. 
 
Metallurgical testing was used to evaluate all three concentrates.  Copper concentrates showed 
consistent contents of gold and silver, which will result in credits in smelter payments.  As such, a credit 
for gold and silver has been applied in the cash flow.  Silver and gold credits are based on: 
 

 180 g Ag/t in the copper concentrate; 
 silver selling price of $21.00 per ounce; 
 16 g Au/t in the copper concentrate; and 
 gold selling price of $1,300 per ounce. 

 
22.2 Taxes and Royalties 
 
The PEA includes royalty payments of a 1.5% NSR along with a one-time payment of $1,000,000 as 
required under current agreements (see Section 4.3).  The royalty is considered payable on the gross 
revenue after smelting, thus is after treatment and transportation charges for concentrates.  Royalty 
payments total $42.1 million through the life of the mine. 
 
Tax considerations have been included based on tax rates and treatment concepts provided by InZinc.  
The taxable income is based on revenues less royalties, operating and capital costs, depreciation, 
depletion, and amortization.  Both federal and state taxes are applied to the taxable income at 33.5% and 
5%, respectively.  Total life-of-mine taxes are estimated to be $164.6 million and $24.6 million for

federal and state tax, respectively.  Note that the 33.5% federal tax rates assumes a 34% rate less 0.5% 
due to deductions that would be taken for Utah state taxes paid. 
 
22.3 Cash-Flow Model 
 
Table 22.1 shows the metal production schedule along with the gross revenue and royalty to be paid.  
Table 22.2 shows the operating and capital costs along with tax treatments.  Together these constitute 
the cash-flow model for the West Desert economic analysis.  C1, C2, and C3 costs shown on Table 22.2 
reflect the definitions of Brook Hunt (2009).

The construction period is estimated at two years and the production period is estimated at 14.8 years.  
The after-tax payback is 5.66 years when considered from the beginning of construction, or 3.66 years 
after completion of construction. 
 
22.5 Economic Sensitivities 
 
Economic sensitivity tables were completed for revenue, operating cost, capital cost, zinc price, and 
magnetite price.  The results are shown in Table 22.5, Table 22.6, Table 22.7, Table 22.8, and Table 
22.9 respectively.  As with most base metal projects, the project is most sensitive to changes in 
revenues, which can be a combination of change in metal price or metal recovery.  This is shown as the 
steeper-trending revenue lines in the graphs shown in Figure 22.1.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
This report provides an updated NI 43-101-compliant resource for the West Desert project that adds the 
magnetite resource to the previously reported zinc-copper-indium resource.  The resource is supported 
by additional sampling and analysis of drill core by InZinc in 2013.  
 
MDA has reviewed the project data and the West Desert drill-hole database and has visited the project 
site.  MDA believes that the data provided by InZinc are generally an accurate and reasonable 
representation of the West Desert zinc-copper-indium-magnetite project. 
 
West Desert is a polymetallic skarn deposit containing substantial Inferred and Indicated resources.  The 
deposit, the data defining the deposit, and the resulting resource estimate are considered high quality.  
However, skarn deposits often present rapidly changing geometries, grades, and geology.  These risks, 
imparted into the deposit and resource estimate, should be mitigated with continued deposit definition 
resulting from additional drilling.  
 
Indium is present in the West Desert deposit at unusually high levels.  However, not all historical 
operators of the project recognized this, and in some cases they did not assay their drill-core samples for 
indium.  Zinc, copper, and iron content was, on the other hand, easily recognized and is more common 
to all data sets.  Resource analysis is a function of data and their spatial distribution.  As such, the 
confidence level or classification of the West Desert resource is strongly influenced by the constituent 
with the fewest number of assays.  To counteract the current downgrade in classification due to the 
limited indium data, removing the indium from the current in situ resource has the potential to improve 
the amount of Indicated resources by up to 75% with a minimal (approximately 10%) reduction of the 
overall grades (on a GMV basis).  Therefore, two solutions are available to InZinc in the future.  These 
may include the removal of indium as a resource constituent or additional sampling to improve indium 
assay distribution.  Both solutions represent potentially positive improvements to the resource 
classification.    
  
This report also summarizes resources contained in the near-surface oxide portion of the West Desert 
deposit.  These resources have not been included in the economic analysis, and further metallurgical 
work to determine the viability of these resources is recommended.  
 
Magnetite mineralization is generally more extensive and continuous than the associated zinc and 
copper mineralization at West Desert. The addition of magnetite does not increase the complexity or 
cost of mining the zinc and copper resources.  In fact, where magnetite co-exists with appreciable zinc 
and copper, it significantly increases the NSR value of the resource.  The combination of these factors 
positively impacts the "potentially mineable resources."  The underground mining designs applied in 
this study, including sub-level long-hole stoping, are based on limited geotechnical information.  MDA 
recommends detailed geotechnical studies to support these applications in advanced studies.   
 
Metallurgical results provide confidence in the ability to produce iron, copper, and zinc concentrates 
from the West Desert project materials.  Additional test work will be required to confirm and optimize 
the metallurgical process with more representative drill core from the project.  Future test work will 
need to provide a simulation of the entire proposed flowsheet, including the recovery of iron minerals 
prior to flotation, and to evaluate the impact of significantly reducing the flotation tonnage and the

corresponding increase in flotation feed grades.  Key metallurgical parameters requiring additional work 
include primary grind optimization and copper flotation reagent conditions.  Iron, copper, and zinc 
concentrates have shown a consistent ability to be within standard market specifications for their 
respective markets. 
 
In this study, potentially mineable resources (above cut-off) at West Desert comprise 7.86 million tonnes 
of Indicated and 20.56 million tonnes of Inferred material (undiluted).  Magnetite represents 
approximately 50% of this material.  The magnetic-separation process will recover approximately 97% 
of the magnetite as a high-quality iron concentrate.  The flotation feed tonnages are expected to be 
reduced by approximately 50 percent through the removal of magnetite, which will correspondingly 
double the zinc-copper grade of the flotation feed when compared to the mine production grades.  Based 
on the resource model, the grades of mine production should range from 6.7% to 2.7% zinc and 0.7% to 
0.3% copper over the 14.8 year production period.  
 
On a per tonne operating cost basis, the magnetite recovery process is expected to add approximately 
$0.75 to the baseline grinding, flotation, and dewatering costs for the project.  In comparison, the 
estimated cost to discard waste to the tailings storage facility is $0.25/tonne.  The process costs to 
produce all three concentrates are estimated at $12.23/tonne milled.  The incremental cost to produce 
magnetite is a fraction of the market value of magnetite concentrates and should make the option of 
producing a magnetite concentrate very attractive to the project.  These estimates demonstrate the 
efficiency and cost effectiveness of processing a magnetite concentrate and the resulting cost benefits of 
waste reduction at West Desert.    
 
West Desert has the potential to produce three concentrates.  In this study, zinc concentrates represent 
the highest value, containing approximately 1.6 billion pounds payable metal (with associated indium) 
over the life of the mine.  Copper concentrates are estimated to contain 147 million pounds of payable 
metal over the life of the mine.  Iron concentrates, at an estimated 63% iron grade, would total 
approximately 15 million tonnes over the life of the mine.  No deleterious elements are identified at 
penalty levels in the concentrates.  
  
Zinc and copper concentrates are produced at a large number of mines and treated at a variety of 
smelters and refineries around the world.  Global markets for iron concentrates are about 2.1 billion 
tonnes annually (Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, 2012).  Market research suggests a trend towards 
higher demand for quality iron concentrates, particularly in China, as higher energy costs and new 
environmental policies are implemented.  MDA recommends marketing and transportation studies, 
including the development of potential domestic U. S. markets for the magnetite concentrates, be 
initiated at the next step of advancement.    
 
At this level of study, the potential for a larger, multi-commodity revenue stream generated from the 
three concentrate products over an extended period (14.8 years in this study) is financially attractive. 
Currently, deposit complexity is highlighted as a potential risk.  MDA recommends additional drilling to 
improve deposit definition.  
 
Substantial underground resources at West Desert remain open for expansion to the east, west, and 
south.  There is also potential for the discovery of new zones beyond these extensions.  The inclusion of 
a magnetite (iron) concentrate to the product stream adds significant volume and potential complexity to

the transportation and marketing of products.  However, proximity to roads, power, rail, and the 
potential services/support and labor pool available in the nearby Salt Lake City area are important 
positive factors in this regard.  
 
West Desert is a project meriting substantial amounts of additional exploration and development work. 
 
Note that a preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature.  It includes Inferred mineral 
resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied 
that would enable them to be classified as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary 
assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 
economic viability.  Additional studies are required to advance the project beyond the PEA.  To that end, 
there are various potential risks and opportunities that should be considered during the next study. 
 
25.1 Risks and Opportunities 
 
At a PEA level of analysis, the risks and opportunities associated with any resource project are typically 
related to lack of detailed information, the collection of which is beyond the scope of the study.  
Accordingly, this section highlights areas of the project that require further study or data collection to 
potentially mitigate or manage a risk or realize an opportunity at the next level of study.  
 
Risks and opportunities were evaluated based on input from InZinc and the authors of this technical 
report.  Both risks and opportunities were assessed as to likelihood of occurrence and impact should the 
risk or opportunity occur.  A scale of 1 to 10 is used for likelihood, with 1 being less likely to occur and 
10 being most likely to occur.  The same scale is used for impact, with 1 being a minimal impact to the 
project and 10 being a severe impact should the risk or opportunity occur.  A high impact of a risk 
would take value away from the project, while a high impact due to an opportunity would increase the 
project's value.  While the values that are assigned are subjective in nature, the intent is to identify areas 
that should be studied in further detail to improve the project.

1. There are multiple concentrates that will be sent to different processors, which will result in 
handling and transport complexity. 

o Mitigation:  Concentrate transport management plans will need to be designed, and 
timely conclusion of marketing contracts will provide InZinc with access to concentrate 
markets. 

2. Geotechnical characteristics for the underground operations are not well understood and need to 
be studied. 

o Mitigation:  Initiation of detailed geotechnical studies are required during the next phase 
of drilling. 

3. Skarns may be variable in metal grade and geology, leading to spatial- and grade-continuity risk.  
This is also noted in item 5. 

o Mitigation:  Infill drilling may be done from the surface; however, this risk will be further 
mitigated with underground delineation drilling and geologic mapping required at the 
production stage. 

4. There may be constraints in port and port-handling infrastructure for magnetite product.  
o Mitigation:  Commencement of marketing and transportation studies to identify potential 

domestic opportunities and review of capacity at multiple U. S. west-coast ports and 
multiple rail carriers currently servicing the project region. 

5. Hydrology for the project is not well understood. 
o Mitigation:  Groundwater hydrology studies will need to be done in the next phase of 

study. 
6. Gold and silver values have been included in the PEA using a production credit based on 

concentrate metallurgical tests and may not be realized during operations. 
o Mitigation:  Gold and silver should be added to the resource model. 

7. Magnetite content is based on conversion factors determined from a relatively limited number of 
Davis Tube analyses.  

o Mitigation:  Additional Davis Tube analyses will be required to increase the confidence 
in the magnetite. 

8. Permits will be required for mining, and with denial or delays in obtaining the permits, the 
project may not go forward.  

o Mitigation:  Baseline environmental studies should begin during the next phase of the 
project.  No deleterious ore components or environmental issues have been identified to 
date. 

9. The small number of indium samples results in a large portion of the deposit being classified as 
Inferred.  

o Mitigation:  Either additional drilling would be required to improve the data set used for 
indium estimation, or the indium should be excluded from the resource.  Should indium 
be excluded from the resource, the resource classification would be increased. 

10. Process-water availability needs to be determined. 
o Mitigation:  Site-wide water balances should be better understood and should include 

flow rates from currently producing water wells.  Water balances should include process-
water recycling and mine dewatering for makeup water, as available. 

11. Indium may not be payable in a third-party smelting agreement. 
o Mitigation:  Smelter contract negotiations are required to better identify the value of 

indium. 
12. Environmentally sensitive sites may impact the ability to permit the project.

o Mitigation: Fish Springs Wildlife Reserve is in a separate drainage basin, and no 
groundwater impacts are obvious.  Ungulate and waterfowl baseline studies will likely be 
necessary to mitigate any impact risk.

1. It may be possible to increase mining and processing throughput. 
o Work Plan:  Increased throughput would reduce the overall mining and processing cost.  

The primary constraint at this time is mining, and additional study would be required to 
ascertain if a higher throughput is possible.  This should be done in the next phase of 
study. 

2. There is good potential to increase the resource, especially the high NSR-value resource, to the 
east, west, and south. 

o Work Plan:  Additional drilling will be required to define additional resources. 
3. Potential for the discovery of localized higher-grade areas within the resource.  

o Work Plan:  Additional step-out and infill drilling will be required to better define high-
grade zones. 

4. Some of the magnetite resource, particularly at depth, appears to extend past the limits of the 
zinc-copper data, which could be a factor in the lower apparent Zn and Cu grades in this 
material.  

o Work Plan:  Additional step-out and infill drilling will be required to better define the Zn 
and Cu grades in the lower magnetite at depth.  It may be best to defer this drilling until 
the underground development is established to get the most value out of drilling dollars. 

5. The costs for shipping of magnetite concentrate are fairly high and could be significantly reduced 
through contract negotiations with the rail carriers or sourcing its refinement in the United States 
as opposed to shipping it to China. 

o Work Plan:  Marketing and transportation studies should be initiated to identify and 
develop domestic opportunities and review capacity at the multiple U. S. west coast ports 
and multiple rail carriers currently servicing the project region. 

6. There may be a potential to process oxide zinc mineralization.  A significant resource of zinc is 
present in oxide mineralization.  Initial mining and metallurgical studies have shown that the 
oxide resource fits within an open pit shell and that acid leaching results in good recovery of 
zinc, but acid consumption is high. Should the oxide be mined from open-pit activities, then this 
may reduce the cost of generating backfill materials for the underground (no need for borrow 
pits). 

o Work Plan:  Metallurgical optimization studies should be completed with respect to the 
oxide mineralization.  Additional marketing studies may be required to understand the 
value in the oxide portion of the deposit. 

7. Revisions and cost reductions to the tailings management facility. 
o Work Plan:  The tailings facility should be optimized during the next phase of study. 

8. There may be recoverable molybdenum in the copper concentrates (Likelihood 3, Impact 2). 
o Work Plan:  Additional metallurgical test work should be completed for molybdenum to 

determine the recoverability within the copper concentrate.  Additional drilling may be 
able to define additional molybdenum resources.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The work that has been completed to date has demonstrated that InZinc's West Desert project is a 
property of merit and justifies additional work leading to a pre-feasibility study as described in this 
Section.  
 
Substantial Indicated and Inferred resources of skarn-hosted zinc, copper, indium, and magnetite have 
been outlined at the West Desert property, mainly in sulfide mineralization but also in the upper near-
surface oxidized extensions of these sulfide bodies.  The current PEA is based on the existing sulfide 
resource base.  However, these defined resources remain open for expansion to the east, west, and south, 
and there is very good potential for the discovery of new, similar zones beyond these extensions.  Before 
a formal pre-feasibility study is initiated, additional drilling should be carried out to more closely define 
the actual limits of mineralization. 
 
In addition, in order to state reserves for the West Desert deposit, conversion of some Inferred resources 
to Indicated resources should be done.  Two main issues remain as obstacles to such a conversion: the 
database does not include sufficient indium assays, and not enough Davis Tube work has been 
completed to achieve a higher level of confidence in the magnetite/iron database.  In order to overcome 
the indium issue, either indium would need to be removed from the resource or additional drilling and 
analysis for indium should be completed.  For the magnetite/iron database, sufficient sample rejects 
from InZinc's drilling programs should be available for selective Davis Tube analyses to complement 
existing data. 
 
In addition to the additional drilling and test work described above, hydrology, geotechnical, and 
baseline environmental studies should be conducted in anticipation of a pre-feasibility study and 
permitting requirements 
 
MDA recommends that InZinc undertake a two-phase approach to further develop the deposit: 
 
Phase One: 
 

1) resource expansion drilling and exploration drilling on the flanks of the deposit; 
2) infill drilling and sampling to upgrade resource classification (and incorporating advanced 

metallurgical sampling and detailed geotechnical data collection); 
3) baseline environmental and hydrological studies; and 
4) a concentrate marketing and transportation study 

 
Phase Two: 

Advance to pre-feasibility study ("PFS") once maximum resource thresholds/classifications are 
achieved along with requisite metallurgical and geotechnical data.  Budgetary estimates for a PFS 
are dependent on the ultimate size of the deposit and any resulting changes in metal zonation or 
geometry.

26.1 Phase One Work Program 
  
Phase One work is expected to include exploration for resource expansion through approximately 
10,000m of core drilling, focusing on the following objectives: 
 

 the expansion of existing resources by drilling open-ended extensions on the flanks of the 
deposit;  

 the identification of new zones of mineralization away from existing resources but in similar 
stratigraphic settings, particularly in the region between the existing resources and skarn-type 
copper-zinc-molybdenum mineralization encountered in historic drill hole CC-43 located some 
650m to the east; 

 increasing the level of confidence in the resource through selective infill and the addition of 
indium analyses;  

 if necessary, supplying additional samples for Davis Tube analyses to supplement those to be 
conducted on existing sample rejects, and 

 obtaining geotechnical and hydrologic data. 
   
 
Additional metallurgical work will be required to further expand the metallurgical data base of the 
project using the preliminary results obtained in previous test work programs.  It is recommended that 
approximately six drill holes be devoted to the recovery of core, with these samples used exclusively for 
metallurgical testing; this should generate approximately 2,000kg of mineralized core for testing.  
Selection of drilling locations will be based on expected mining schedules, and the samples should fairly 
represent mine production.  Drilling costs are estimated to be about $300,000.  Metallurgical testing of 
these materials is estimated to cost approximately $600,000 and be limited to bench-scale testing of the 
proposed process.  Detailed mineralogical analysis as well as optimization of copper and zinc flotation 
conditions will be the key objectives of this test work program.  More accurate recovery data for copper 
and zinc will be obtained from this test work, as well as a more accurate characterization of final 
concentrate assays.  InZinc may elect to conduct this metallurgical work either as an addition to the 
exploration work described above or as part of the PFS described in Section 26.2, although it is currently 
included in the budget for Phase One shown in Table 26.1.   
 
The resource estimate will need to be updated to include additional drilling and increased levels of 
confidence from metallurgical studies.   
 
Engineering studies need to be carried out to better understand geotechnical and hydrological issues. 
Hydrologic investigations will most likely involve the drilling of a number of holes as well as the testing 
and monitoring of existing water wells and are needed for general project permitting purposes as well as 
to identify supplemental water sources.  Geotechnical investigations should be conducted to verify 
stability for infrastructure as well as identifying underground rock mechanics. 
 
Environmental baseline studies are warranted to initiate the permitting process and should take into 
account disturbances from historical mining and exploration activities pre-dating InZinc's involvement 
that are present on the property.

Marketing studies should be completed to look into various opportunities for processing of zinc, copper, 
and particularly for iron concentrates.  These studies should include investigation of transportation 
options, optimal locations for rail load-out and port facilities, and the possibility of identifying a 
domestic consumer(s) for iron concentrates. 
 
An approximate budget for a Phase One program is given in Table 26.1. 
 

Table 26.1 Phase One Recommendations and Associated Costs 

 
 

26.2 Phase Two Work Program 
 
The project would advance to PFS once maximum resource thresholds/classifications are achieved along 
with requisite metallurgical and geotechnical data.  Budgetary estimates for a PFS are dependent on the 
ultimate size of the deposit and any resulting changes in metal zonation or geometry.  However, such a 
study could include additional drilling, continued metallurgical optimization, underground bulk 
sampling, as warranted, and advanced engineering studies as well as continued environmental work.
