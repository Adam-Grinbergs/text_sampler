Project No. 09-1439-0001 1

1.0 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

Stornoway Diamond Corporation (Stornoway) retained Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) to provide an 

independent Mineral Resource Estimate Update for the Renard Diamond Project (Renard Project) located in the 

Otish Mountains area of north-central Quebec.  The present Mineral Resource Estimate has been completed in 

accordance with the CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions referred to in National Instrument 

43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and has been carried out to support the press release by 

Stornoway on December 8, 2009. 

This report represents the second reporting of the Renard Project. Since the last disclosure, an additional 

16,506 m of core drilling and 6.2 t of microdiamond sampling have been undertaken. The December 2009 

Renard Mineral Resource Estimate Update was prepared by an independent Qualified Person, David Farrow, 

P.Geo., of Golder, and peer reviewed by Darrell Jane Farrow, Pr.Sci.Nat., of Golder. The methodology of the 

resource estimate and this report has been senior reviewed by Kevin Palmer, P.Geo., of Golder. External review 

of some aspects of microdiamond analysis has been undertaken by Mr. Johan Ferreira, Pr.Sci.Nat., of Johan 

Ferreira and Associates (Ltd.), an expert in microdiamond analysis and interpretation. Diamond breakage 

studies were undertaken by Dr. Paddy. J. Lawless, Pr.Sci.Nat., of Dr. Paddy Lawless and Associates (CC).  

The Mineral Resource Estimate comprises the integration of kimberlite volumes, density, petrology and diamond 

content-data obtained from 81,894 m of diamond drilling, 6,151 m of reverse circulation (RC) drilling, 12.7 t of 

samples submitted for microdiamond analysis, 600.8 cts of diamonds (6,457 stones) recovered from RC drilling 

and 8,611.6 cts of diamonds (84,381 stones) recovered from surface trenching and underground bulk sampling.  

Site visits to the Renard Project were conducted by David Farrow and Darrell Farrow between March 5 and 

March 9, 2009. Exploration drilling, core logging and sampling were in progress during the visit.  

Unless indicated otherwise monetary units used in this report are in Canadian dollars. 

1.2 Property Tenure 

The Renard Diamond Project, referred to as the Renard Project in this document is situated on Mining 

Exploration Licence PEM 1555 which forms part of the Foxtrot Property. 

Tenements in the Foxtrot Property area were initially staked in 1996 by a joint venture between Ashton 

Mining Canada Inc. (Ashton) and SOQUEM Inc. (SOQUEM), with Ashton as operator. Subsequently, the 

joint venture partnership was reassigned to Ashton Diamonds (Canada) Inc. and Diaquem Inc., a wholly 

owned subsidiary of SOQUEM. In January 2007, Ashton was acquired by Stornoway and title transferred 

to Stornoway.  

The Foxtrot Property comprises Mining Exploration Licences PEM 1555 and PEM 1556. Mining Exploration 

Licences are registered in the names of Les Diamond Stornoway Canada Inc. and Diaquem Inc. in the 

proportions of 50:50. The Renard kimberlites, Lynx and Hibou dykes are situated on PEM 1555. 

As at the effective date of this Report, Mining Exploration Licence PEM 1555 is in good standing. 



2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 2

1.3 Property Location and Site Description 

The Foxtrot Property is located approximately 820 km north of the city of Montreal, 120 km south of the  

all-weather Trans-TaÃ¯ga highway and 150 km south-southeast of Hydro-QuÃ©bec's LG-4 electricity generating 

station. Current access to the property is via air. The closest town is TÃ©miscamie, on Lac Albanel. Stornoway 

currently sources material from the regional centres of Chibougamau and Mistissini, both of which act as staging 

posts for trans-shipment of samples and personnel.  

Power is currently supplied to the exploration camp via diesel generators. There is potential for supply from 

LG-4, which would require installation of a high-voltage transmission line connecting to the Project site. 

1.4 Geology and Mineralization 

The Project area is located within the eastern portion of the Superior Craton. The Craton is considered to be 

an amalgamation of small continental fragments of Meso-Archean age and Neo-Archean oceanic plates, with 

a complex history of aggregation. 

There are five episodes of kimberlitic volcanism in Quebec; from south to north, the kimberlite fields are 

TÃ©miscamingue, Desmaraisville, Otish, Wemindji and Torngat. The Renard Cluster is considered to be part 

of the Otish kimberlitic volcanic event. 

To date, nine kimberlite pipes have been identified over a 2 km2 area in the Renard Cluster (Renard 1 to 

Renard 10; Renard 5 and Renard 6 being one kimberlite body, known as Renard 65). The kimberlites are 

typically spaced between 50 m and 500 m from each other. Whole-rock trace element compositions 

suggest a closer affinity to Group I kimberlite (olivine-rich, monticellite, serpentine, calcite kimberlites), with 

derivation from a garnet-bearing mantle. The Lynx and Hibou dyke systems are situated to the west of the 

Renard pipes. 

Geophysical data and drill information from delineation and bulk sampling programs indicate the Renard 

pipes are irregular and elliptical in plan view. Surface areas of the kimberlite portion of the pipes range from 

0.1 ha to 1.7 ha. 

The pipes comprise root zone to diatreme facies rocks characterized by complex internal geology, with the 

dominant phase composed of massive volcaniclastic kimberlite classified as "tuffisitic" kimberlitic breccia 

(TKB). The TKB contains 15% - 90% by volume, fresh to moderately altered granitoid, country rock clasts 

in a matrix that is generally dominated by serpentinized olivine macrocrysts, carbonates and serpentine.  

A minor amount of coherent "hypabyssal" kimberlite (HK) with a small proportion of highly altered and 

digested country rock xenoliths is also present. These are considered to be later stage intrusions that occur 

throughout the bodies or on the periphery. This material is characterized by abundant, disseminated calcite, 

olivine macrocrysts and less than 15% by volume crustal xenoliths. Extensive sampling programs conducted 

between 2001 and 2009 have demonstrated that both the pipe and dykes are diamondiferous. 



2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010

1.5 Exploration Concept 

Approximately 618 drill holes (110,170 m) have been drilled on the Property since 2001, comprising 

36 reverse circulation (RC) holes (6,151 m) and 582 core holes (104,019 m). In addition, eight holes 

(122.7 m) have been drilled for specifically for geotechnical and hydrological purposes.  

Core drilling has occurred on the property each year since 2001. Large-diameter RC drilling undertaken during 

the 2004, 2006 and 2007 field seasons collected more than 900 t of material for diamond testing.  

Since 2005, more than 3,400 t of kimberlite have been excavated from trenches on the Lynx, Hibou and North 

Anomaly dykes as well as from the Renard 4 and Renard 65 kimberlitic bodies. 

Between August 2006 and February 2007, underground exploration at the Renard Property extracted 

60 samples of kimberlite from Renard 2 and Renard 3 for a total of 10,000 t (calculated tonnes) of which some 

4,700 t were processed to recover diamonds. 

The last two drilling campaigns, winter and summer 2009, comprised 16,506 m of core drilling, from which 

4.2 t of material was processed for microdiamonds.  

1.6 Status of Exploration 

Stornoway completed the summer 2009 drilling program and announced the results of a Mineral Resource 

Estimate Update on December 8, 2009. There has been no further exploration work on the property since 

that time.  

1.7 Author's Conclusions and Recommendations 

The conclusions and recommendations that have been identified from the 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate 

Update are:  

Most geological aspects of the Renard Project are reasonably well understood. 

The Renard 2, Renard, 3, Renard 4, Renard 9 and Renard 65 pipes, as well as the Lynx and Hibou dyke 

systems contain diamond concentrations that have the potential to be economic. 

Drilling of the Renard 2 kimberlite has significantly increased the mineral resource of the project, primarily a 

function of identifying additional resource at depth, which is less diluted and higher grade. 

The project database was reviewed by Golder using statistical and geostatistical analyses and comparisons 

between paper sources and the digital database. This database is considered acceptable for mineral 

resource estimation. 

The results of the latest Mineral Resource Estimate are tabulated in Tables 1-1 and 1-2. The Mineral 

Resource Estimate is based on the continuity of geology between kimberlite at depth and kimberlite nearer 

surface, and the generally low variation in sample results for the different kimberlite phases with depth.

Note:  Totals may not equal the sum of the individuals due to rounding. 

There is additional potential for the Project, as the geological models for Renard 3, Renard 4, Renard 65, 

and Renard 9 are based on conservative shapes for the kimberlites at depth, and the evaluation models do 

not incorporate areas of limited drilling at depth. The potential mineral deposits (PMD) are detailed in  

Table 1-3. Total PMD was identified as representing between 27 and 46 million tonnes, containing between 

12 and 26 million carats of diamonds, at an average grade of 46 to 58 cpht. These were defined on a basis 

of geological-modelling, outcrop mapping, limited delineation drilling and surface sampling.  No PMD has 

been outlined for Renard 2 as there are no plans for additional exploration.  The potential quantity and 

grade of any potential mineral deposit is conceptual in nature, there is insufficient exploration to define a 

mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a 

mineral resource.

Complete an update of the 2008 Preliminary Assessment is recommended to investigate what percentage 

of the mineral resource could be converted to a mineral reserve (estimated cost of $250,000). The 

outcomes of this Preliminary Assessment would help to guide further work on the various kimberlite bodies. 

Complete a simulation study on the current pipe shapes (Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4 and Renard 9) 

should be conducted to quantify the levels of uncertainty in the volumetric determination of the various 

pipes and their internal phases (estimated cost of $75,000). 

All available core from the Renard 3, Renard 4 and Renard 9 kimberlites should be line scanned (minimal 

cost as this can be completed by geologists employed by Stornoway).

2.0 INTRODUCTION 

Stornoway Diamond Corporation (Stornoway) retained Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) to provide an 

independent Mineral Resource Estimate Update for the Renard Diamond Project (Renard Project) located in the 

Otish Mountains area of north-central Quebec. 

The purpose of this report is to provide technical support for the December 8, 2009 Stornoway Press Release. 

The present Mineral Resource Estimate incorporates the Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4, Renard 9 and Renard 

65 kimberlite pipes as well as the Lynx and Hibou kimberlite dyke systems and has been completed in 

accordance with the CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions referred to in National Instrument 

43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  

This Mineral Resource Estimate Update represents the second reporting of mineral resources from the Renard 

Project, with the original estimate provided in late December, 2008 (Lecuyer et al., 2008).  Since the last 

disclosure, an additional 16,506 m of core drilling, 6.2 t of microdiamond sampling and 543.9 t of macrodiamond 

sampling has been undertaken. The December 2009 Renard Mineral Resource Estimate was prepared by an 

independent Qualified Person, David Farrow, P.Geo., of Golder, and peer reviewed by Darrell Jane Farrow, 

Pr.Sci.Nat., of Golder. Both this report and the methodology of the Resource Estimate have been reviewed by 

Kevin Palmer, P.Geo., of Golder. External review of some aspects of microdiamond analysis has been 

undertaken by Mr. Johan Ferreira, Pr.Sci.Nat., of Johan Ferreira and Associates (Ltd.), an expert in 

microdiamond analysis and interpretation. Diamond breakage studies were undertaken by Dr. P. J. Lawless, 

Pr.Sci.Nat., of Dr. Paddy Lawless and Associates (CC).  

The Mineral Resource Estimate comprises the integration of kimberlite volumes, density, petrology and diamond 

content-data obtained from 81,894 m of diamond drilling, 6,151 m of reverse circulation (RC) drilling, 12.7 t of 

samples submitted for microdiamond analysis, 600.8 cts of diamonds (6,457 stones) recovered from RC drilling 

and 8,611.6 cts of diamonds (84,381 stones) recovered from surface trenching and underground bulk sampling.  

Site visits to the Renard Project were conducted by David Farrow and Darrell Farrow between March 5 and 

March 9, 2009. Exploration drilling, core logging and sampling were in progress during the visit.  

A general list of abbreviations is found in Table 2-1. The lithological abbreviations are found in Table 9-2.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

Golder has relied upon other experts for information used in this Technical Report for the following items: 

1) Mineral Tenure 

The QP has not reviewed the mineral tenure, nor independently verified the legal status or ownership of the 

Foxtrot Property, the exploration licences surrounding it, or the underlying property agreements. In support 

of Section 4, Golder has relied upon Lavery, De Billy, LLP, of Montreal, a Stornoway-appointed law firm's legal 

opinion for information on the Mining Exploration Licence which hosts the mineral resources referred to in this report 

through the following documents: 

Lavery, De Billy, LLP, Mining Exploration Licence no. 1555 (PEM 1555), Montreal, January 11, 2010. 

This report, in letter form, confirms that PEM 1555 is registered in the Public Register in the name of  

Les Diamants Stornoway (Canada) Inc. (wholly owned by Stornoway) for an undivided interest of 50%, and 

in the name of Stornoway's joint venture partner Diaquem Inc. for an undivided interest of 50%. 

The Mining Exploration Licence will expire on August 28, 2010, unless renewed or converted prior to this 

expiration date.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Location 

Foxtrot Property is situated in the Monts Otish (Otish Mountains) region of the province of Quebec, Canada, 

820 km north of the city of Montreal and 360 km north-northeast of the mining town of Chibougamau 

(Figure 4.1). The property lies some 120 km south of the all-weather Trans-TaÃ¯ga highway and 150 km  

south-southeast of Hydro-QuÃ©bec's LG-4 electricity generating station. 

The closest locality is TÃ©miscamie, on Lac Albanel some 210 km to the south, which is connected by all-weather 

provincial road #167 to the Cree community of Mistissini.

Much of the property is encompassed within National Topographic Sheet (NTS) 033A16, although there are also 

smaller portions in NTS 033A09 and 033H01 (Figure 4.2). Project centroids are at approximately 52Â°49'N and 

72Â°12'W. 

There are currently no active mining operations in the immediate vicinity of the Foxtrot Property, but there are 

numerous active exploration projects primarily to the south and west. 

4.2 Tenure History 

Stornoway Diamond Corporation was created in 2003 as a result of a plan of arrangement between Northern 

Empire Minerals Ltd. and Stornoway Ventures Ltd. Stornoway is actively involved in diamond exploration in 

Canada, with tenements currently held in Quebec, Nunavut, Ontario, Northwest Territories and Alberta. 

Exploration leading to the acquisition of the Foxtrot Property commenced in 1996 under a 50:50 joint venture 

agreement dated March 14, 1996 (and subsequent amendments) between Ashton Mining Canada Inc. (Ashton) 

and SOQUEM Inc. (SOQUEM), with Ashton as operator. The purpose of the initial agreement was to explore for 

diamonds within an area of mutual interest (AMI) in the Ungava Region of Quebec. Although the AMI area has 

been changed from time to time since the agreement was signed, the Foxtrot Property lies within the current 

AMI.

Subsequently, the joint venture partnership was reassigned to Ashton Diamonds (Canada) Inc. and Diaquem 

Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SOQUEM. Stornoway acquired Ashton in January 2007, and currently 

operates the project through its wholly-owned subsidiary Les Diamants Stornoway (Canada) Inc. 

When initially granted through online staking activities in 2000 and 2001, the Property consisted of two Mining 

Exploration Licences, PEM 1555 and PEM 1556, and 2,121 mining claims. In 2007, 500 claims and, in 2009, 

1,161 claims, from the northern portion of the Foxtrot property were allowed to lapse, as they were no longer of 

interest to the joint venture.  The current landholdings (Figure 4.2) are registered in the names of Les Diamants 

Stornoway (Canada) Inc. and Diaquem Inc. in the proportions of 50:50. The Renard kimberlite pipes and the 

Lynx and Hibou dykes, subjects of this report, are all located well within the boundaries of PEM 1555.

2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 12 

4.3 Mineral Tenure in Quebec 

Mining Exploration Licences are issued in Quebec for a period of five years and may be renewed for one 

additional five-year period provided the conditions of renewal described in the Quebec Mining Act are met. 

These conditions include graduated work requirements and renewal fees at the rate of $120 per km2. Prior to 

expiry of the Mining Exploration Licence (PEM), the entire area may be converted to mining claims in an online 

process, and the excess exploration expenditures (or credits) carried over from the PEM to the new claims. 

Claims are issued based on a two-year assessment period, with the work requirements increasing for each 

period. Renewal fees, paid earlier than 60 days prior to the anniversary date, are $107 per claim. 

In Quebec, the claim holder has the exclusive right to search for all mineral substances in the public domain, 

with certain exceptions. In accordance with the Quebec Mining Act, a claim holder must comply with the 

obligation to carry out work on the claims in an amount based on the surface area of the claim and its location in 

relation to the 52nd parallel. When the work carried out is insufficient, or if the work was not carried out, the 

titleholder may pay an amount equivalent to the required amount in lieu of work. Alternately, excess exploration 

credits from other claims within a 4.5 km radius may be transferred to meet any shortfall. Claim renewal 

applications must be received, at the latest, prior to 15 days of a claim's expiry. 

4.4 Mineral Exploration Licences and Claims 

The Foxtrot Property comprises three groups of separate but essentially contiguous landholdings known as the 

Foxtrot 1, Foxtrot 2 and Foxtrot 3 blocks, covering a total area of 68,158.39 ha (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). Foxtrot 1 

encompasses PEM 1556 (12,930 ha), Foxtrot 2 encompasses PEM 1555 (32,570 ha), and Foxtrot 3 contains 

460 individual mining claims (22,658.391 ha). Thirteen claims in two groups belonging to Foxtrot 3, and included 

in the totals above, lie north of the main block and are non-contiguous (Figure 4.1).  

Mineral Exploration Licences are registered in the names of Les Diamants Stornoway (Canada) Inc. and 

Diaquem Inc. in the proportions on a 50:50 basis.  As at the effective date of this report, all mining licences and 

claims are reported by Stornoway to be in good standing. 

All known kimberlite mineralization, including the pipes and the dyke systems, as well as the existing 

infrastructure, including Camp LagopÃ¨de, diesel generators, underground infrastructure, the on-site dense media 

separation (DMS) facility, and processed kimberlite containment facility, that is associated with the Foxtrot 

Property (and referred to collectively as the Renard Core Area), are situated well within PEM 1555 (Foxtrot 2). 

The corners of PEM 1555 are defined by the following geographical coordinates in NAD 27 Zone 18: 

677000 mE and 5850000 mN. 

682000 mE and 5865000 mN. 

700000 mE and 5859000 mN.

PEM 1555 was registered on August 29, 2000, and is in good standing until August 28, 2010. In advance of this 

date, the entire area currently covered by PEM 1555, or a portion thereof, may be converted to mining claims by 

the joint venture. 

PEM 1556, contiguous with PEM 1555 to the north, is defined by the following geographical coordinates in 

NAD 27 Zone 18: 

694142.9 mE and 5841428.6 mN.

PEM 1556 was also registered on August 29, 2000, and is in good standing until August 28, 2010. In advance of 

that date, it too may be converted to mining claims. No kimberlites are known within this mining exploration 

licence and there is no infrastructure.  

Camp Lac Emmanuel, an exploration camp that is currently on care and maintenance, is located immediately 

northeast of PEM 1555, within the Foxtrot 3 block at 698849 mE and 5860499 mN (NAD 27 Zone 18), on mining 

claim 1007021. A single, narrow (approximately 0.1 m thickness), north-trending kimberlite dyke with an 

estimated strike length of 450 m straddles mining claims 1009366 and 1009385. No other kimberlites are known 

within the Foxtrot 3 claims.  

It is possible that potential future project infrastructure, such as a winter road, an all-season road or a power line, 

could pass through the area covered by Foxtrot 1 or Foxtrot 3, but surface access of this nature is not dependent 

upon holding mineral tenure.  

4.5 Agreements 

The 50:50 joint venture between Ashton Diamonds (Canada) Inc. and Diaquem Inc. is governed by an 

agreement dated March 14, 1996, and subsequent amendments. The Foxtrot Project is managed by the joint 

venture. Stornoway, through Les Diamants Stornoway (Canada) Inc., is the project operator. 

4.6 Royalties 

There are no other royalties, back-in rights, payments or other encumbrances applicable to the Property known 

at the present time, except as discussed below. 

Mineral production from an active metal mine within the province of Quebec is subject to taxation at a base rate 

of 12% of the net profits. There are a variety of credits and allowances available (such as exploration, northern 

mine, credit on duties refundable for losses and a processing allowance) that may serve to reduce that base rate 

to a minimum of 4.2%, giving one of the lowest tax rates in Canada. At present, there are no diamond mines in

Project No. 09-1439-0001 14 

Quebec, and the MinistÃ¨re des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune (MRNF) does not have a specific taxation 

scheme in place for diamond mines. The government of Quebec, through the MRNF, has invited industry to 

provide input for Quebec's future Mineral Strategy. In 2007, Stornoway met with the Direction de l'imposition 

miniÃ¨re of MRNF to explain the diamond industry, and has also provided written comments to the MRNF minister 

and the group responsible for developing Quebec's Mineral Strategy. Stornoway has suggested that diamond 

production be considered equivalent to the production of any other metal commodity in Quebec, and that 

taxation of a diamond mine follow the existing standards. No decision has yet been made. 

Following the release of the new Quebec Mineral Strategy in June 2009, the minister responsible for MRNF, 

M. Serge Simard, clearly indicated his intention to increase the base rate royalty, but without indicating which 

rate will ultimately be chosen. The Mining Duty Act, which defines the metal royalty, is expected to be revised in 

2010. 

Moreover, the government indicated in the Quebec Mineral Strategy document its intention to put in place 

various measures with the objective of promoting diamond mining in Quebec: 

The Government of QuÃ©bec will continue implementing its Strategy for the Accelerated Development of 

QuÃ©bec's Diamond Potential. 

SOQUEM will continue to support the development of the diamond industry. 

The government will adapt the mining royalties regime to the special characteristics of the diamond 

industry. 

The government intends to pursue its objective of "10% local processing of rough diamonds mined in 

QuÃ©bec" by proceeding with cutting, polishing, and jewellery-making activities. 

4.7 Permits 

Currently, work on the Project is conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions contained within the 

surface exploration permit and other permits that are required for the camp, fuel storage and exploration 

activities. The joint venture has received the permits and approvals it needs to operate and conduct the 

associated advanced exploration activities. These permits and authorizations are in good standing for the 

continuation of the Foxtrot Property assessment.  Golder has not verified that the permits are in good standing. 

4.8 Surface Rights 

The Foxtrot Property, including the Renard kimberlite pipes and the Lynx and Hibou kimberlite dykes, is situated 

within the region of northern Quebec governed by the James Bay and Northern QuÃ©bec Agreement 1975, as 

amended (JBNQA), a land claims agreement executed by the Government of Quebec, the Government of 

Canada, the Grand Council of the Cree of Quebec (GCC) and the Northern Quebec Inuit Association, amongst 

others.

The JBNQA provides for three categories of land, Categories I to III, each with specifically defined rights. The 

Foxtrot Property lies within Category III lands in an area in proximity to the community of Mistissini (the Cree 



2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010

Nation of Mistissini, or CNM). Category III lands are public lands where Cree communities have certain rights, 

particularly in regard to trapping, hunting, fishing and the development of outfitter operations. Surface and 

mineral rights on Category III lands reside with the Government of Quebec and are governed by the applicable 

land use laws and regulations, implemented by the relevant regulatory authorities. Members of the CNM 

undertake hunting, fishing and trapping activities within the Foxtrot Property, with the Renard kimberlites 

occurring in an area known to them as "yuus-kanchiisu-saakahiikan" (mild rock ptarmigan lake). More 

specifically, the Renard kimberlites lie within the CNM trapline area designated as M-11, used by Clarence and 

Abel Swallow (known as the 'tallyman'). 

Under the terms of the JBNQA, lawfully authorized persons have the right to develop Category III lands. 

However, developers are subject to an environmental and social protection regime, which provides for the 

protection of the hunting, fishing and trapping rights of the Cree. 

Golder has not verified the above comments with respect to surface rights access. 

4.9 Environment 

The joint venture has undertaken, or contracted out, a series of environmental programs and studies since 2002, 

facilitating the acquisition of a significant amount of data. Three main environmental baseline studies have been 

completed, which include inventories of fish, fauna and flora, surface water analyses (natural and processed), 

groundwater sampling, rock and soil sampling, and acid rock drainage studies. Additional data have been 

included in requests for permits and certificates addressed to various government authorities. Commencing in 

2003, Roche LtÃ©e ingÃ©nieur-conseil, an engineering consultant based in Quebec City, was mandated to provide 

environmental advice and appropriate guidelines for the acquisition of environmental data. No areas of specific 

concern were identified; however, it was noted that due to acid rain over the previous 50 years and a lack of 

natural buffering material, the local lakes were relatively acidic (pH of 4.5 to 6.5) although they did host fish 

populations. A list of environmental studies completed on the Project to the effective date of the report is given in 

Table 4-1.

Review of Environmental Data and Studies â€“ Renard 
Diamond Project, Quebec 

R. Goulet 

Following the underground sampling program, any effluent discharge pertaining to the closed underground 

excavations was monitored by Stornoway and a monthly report provided to the Quebec Ministry of the 

Environment. In August 2008, as per the remediation plan provided to the MRNF, the surface mine water sump 

was rehabilitated and fully restored; therefore, effluent testing is no longer required. Stornoway has previously 

provided a remediation plan to MRNF to clean up infrastructure associated with the bulk sample and the DMS 

process facility. The remediation plan was accepted and, as required by regulation in Quebec, 70% of the 

estimated $138,000 cost (or $96,000) has been provided to the appropriate government authority. 

During March to April of 2006, leaking fuel drums required clean-up activities that generated some 80 m3 of 

contaminated soil. This contaminated soil was stored safely on site in a lined berm. To date, roughly 35% of the 

contaminated soil has been removed from the property and shipped south for disposal at an approved facility 

(total disposal cost for the 35% is about $4,000). The cost to clean up the site has already been incurred by 

Stornoway, and the cause of the leakage is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit between Stornoway and the fuel 

supplier. 

4.10 Socio-Economics 

The Stornowayâ€“SOQUEM joint venture is committed to building long-term relationships with the Cree Nation of 

Mistissini and the GCC. The joint venture has taken a pro-active approach to community relations through 

information sessions, Band Council meetings, communications and site tours. The joint venture will continue to 

consult with the community and the GCC as the Renard Project develops. To this effect, a Renardâ€“Mistissini

Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 18 

Working Group has been established, and includes representatives of the joint venture and the Mistissini 

community. The mandate of this committee is to optimize the level of employment for Mistissini inhabitants. The 

joint venture works closely with the Cree Human Resources Development (CHRD) to develop training programs 

adapted to local workers, and is committed to buying local goods and services when it is feasible, as well as 

promoting the local economy. 

Since 2001, Stornoway and its predecessors, on behalf of the joint venture, have engaged the CNM through 

community and band council presentations and other communications to provide information on the progress of 

the Project. Employment and training opportunities have been provided to members of the CNM and, during the 

six year period from 2004 to the end of the third quarter of 2009 (inclusive).  Some 31,845 person-days of 

employment were generated by the Project (excluding specialized contractors) of which 23.7% of  

non-specialized employees or contractors at the Foxtrot Property were Cree from Mistissini (approximately 31 

person-years of employment).  The proportion of Cree workers ranged from a low of 12.7% in 2008 to a  

high of 30.9% in 2006. Since March 2007, this employment relationship has been formalized through the 

Renard-Mistissini Working Group, the main mandate of which is to coordinate and optimize the opportunities of 

employment for members of the CNM and to develop training programs adapted to local workers. Since 2007, 

Stornoway has been in discussions with the CNM towards the execution of a formal agreement designed to set 

out the nature of the relationship with the CNM, as a step towards the eventual negotiation of an Impact and 

Benefit Agreement. At the time of writing, discussions between Stornoway and CNM are ongoing. 

In addition, these employment contracts are helping to develop a qualified local workforce. In 2007 and 2008, 

workers from Mistissini participated in operation of the DMS facility, drilling programs (both core and reverse 

circulation), exploration programs (heavy mineral sampling, geophysical surveying, prospecting and trenching), 

camp maintenance and housekeeping. In 2009, Mistissini personnel assisted with geochemical and geotechnical 

aspects of the core drilling program, as well as camp maintenance and housekeeping.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

5.1.1 Air 

Fixed or rotary-wing aircraft are required to reach the Foxtrot Property. During summer months, float-equipped, 

fixed-wing aircraft and, during the winter months, ski-equipped aircraft can be leased from various hunting and 

fishing outfitters in the area or from small air service companies in Chibougamau, Mistissini, TÃ©miscamie or 

Wemindji. The Chibougamauâ€“Chapais airport has daily scheduled flights to Montreal. Flight time from 

Chibougamau to the Property is approximately one to two hours depending on the type of aircraft used. 

During winter, an ice airstrip measuring up to 1,250 m in length is constructed immediately adjacent to Camp 

LagopÃ¨de to allow landing of large aircraft for mobilization of equipment and supplies. In the summer, fixed-wing 

access directly to the Property requires the use of float planes, which can land at a dock (or quay) at Camp 

LagopÃ¨de, within the Renard Core Area. 

During fall freeze-up and spring break-up, access to the Property requires the use of helicopter support. The 

nearest permanent helicopter base is located in Chibougamau. Charter helicopters are frequently based on the 

Property. 

5.1.2 Road 

Highway 109, an all-weather paved road, originates in Matagami, Quebec, and terminates approximately 500 km 

north at the LG-2 hydroelectric generating station in Radisson. Two major, all-weather, gravel roads lead east 

from this highway into the interior of Quebec (Figure 4.1). The North Road connects Chibougamau with the 

James Bay Highway via Nemiscau. The Trans-TaÃ¯ga Highway runs east from Radisson (LG-2) to Caniapiscau 

and provides gravel road access to the LG-3, LG-4, Laforge 1, Laforge 2 and Centrale Brisay hydro sites and 

several caribou hunting lodges in the Interior. LG-4 is roughly 150 km by air from the Renard Core Area. 

Pourvoirie Mirage (Mirage), a hunting/fishing lodge located approximately 50 km to the east of LG-4 along the 

Trans-TaÃ¯ga Highway, owns and operates an all-weather airstrip. Mirage is about 120 km by air from the Project, 

and provides a staging point for the transfer of material from truck to either fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft. 

In the south, an all-weather, gravel road links Chibougamau with TÃ©miscamie and Albanel (150 km) via the 

village of Mistissini on Mistassini Lake. A winter road leads further north another 175 km from the northern end of 

this road to the now-closed Eastmain gold deposit. At its closest point, the winter road is roughly 58 km south of 

the Foxtrot Property. During winter months in recent years, fuel and supplies have been transported along this 

road to a point approximately 40 km south of the road's northern terminus. This northernmost, 40 km section of 

the road is currently closed, and has not been assessed for operability. 

Between 2004 and 2008, a system of unpaved local roads and trails was constructed between Camp LagopÃ¨de, 

the Renard Core Area, the Hibou and the Lynx dyke areas and various exploration drill sites. There is no road 

linking the Property to any outside roads.

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 20 

Stornoway, along with some ten other mining companies, the towns of Chibougamau and Mistissini, and several 

provincial and federal government agencies have joined together to form the Otish Road Committee. The 

purpose of this committee is to bring a variety of stakeholders together to determine how to develop and promote 

the Otish all-season, multi-service road, designed ultimately to join the community of TÃ©miscamie with the  

Trans-TaÃ¯ga Highway. During 2007, these participants contributed almost $1,000,000 to fund a pre-feasibility 

study under the auspices of the Quebec Ministry of Transport. In March 2009, the QuÃ©bec government included 

in its provincial budget for fiscal year 2009-2010 an allocation of $130 million dollars to be set aside for the 

260 km long "Route des Monts Otish" from Chibougamau to the Otish Mountains area. This commitment from 

the provincial government corresponds to half the total projected cost of this infrastructure project. The Route 

des Monts Otish, now known as the Route 167 Extension, is the road development project designed to connect 

the communities of Chibougamau and Mistissini to the Renard Diamond Project by way of several other 

prospective mining projects and the proposed Albanel-TÃ©miscamie-Otish Park. In November 2009, Transport 

Quebec granted the feasibility/ESIA contract for the Otish Road to the SNC-Lavalin/Roche consortium. Results 

from these studies are expected in the fall of 2010. These studies should also assess the feasibility to construct 

a winter road from the south as the first step of the permanent Otish Road. At present, funding options for the 

Otish Road have not been determined, but industry may elect to participate in building of the road. A winter road 

from the north is also being considered under Stornoway's revision of the 2008 Preliminary Assessment. 

5.2 Climate 

Long winters and short summers characterize the climate. Temperature ranges are extreme, with summer 

maximums of +35Â°C and winter minimums of -45Â°C. Lakes freeze over in late October, thawing in late  

Aprilâ€“May. Abundant precipitation falls in the form of rain and snow. During the winter, snow accumulations of 

several metres are considered normal. Total annual precipitation averages around 80 cm. The Otish Mountains 

form a local topographic high that affects both precipitation and fog. Fog and low-lying clouds can be a challenge 

to aircraft moving north from Chibougamau and Mistissini to the Property. Operations can take place year round 

given the presence of well-equipped camps.  

Forest fires are common in the area during the spring and summer months, but to date have not adversely 

affected the Project. 

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

5.3.1 Local Resources 

The nearest communities to the Foxtrot Property are Chibougamau, the largest community in northern Quebec 

(population about 8,000), Mistissini (4,000), and Wemindji (1,300) (Figure 4.1). Chibougamau serves as the 

major supply centre for regional resource-based industries.  

The joint venture constructed and maintains two field camps on the Foxtrot Property: Emmanuel and LagopÃ¨de. 

During the winter, a 15 km snowmobile trail connects the two camps. Camp Emmanuel has the capacity to lodge 

up to 35 personnel, but is currently on a care-and-maintenance status. Camp LagopÃ¨de, which can host  

75 persons, is used to stage the exploration and advanced drilling and bulk sampling programs in the Renard 



2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009

Core Area. The site has a satellite communications system, a secure logging facility, a fenced storage area for 

holding kimberlitic samples, a garage equipped with a welding shop, and a 10 tph DMS facility. 

5.3.2 Power 

Power is currently supplied to the exploration camps via diesel generators. All required fuel must be flown to the 

site. Development of an all-weather road to the Property, under auspices of the Otish Road Committee and 

Transport Quebec, would reduce the requirement for on-site storage of fuel for power generation. Construction 

of a winter road would have a significant impact on the provision of diesel-generated power for any future work. 

Both of these possibilities require evaluation prior to any production decision. 

The large hydroelectric generating station at LG-4, located approximately 150 km to the northâ€“northwest of the 

Foxtrot Property (Figure 4.1), could potentially supply power to any mine that might be developed on the 

Property. Stornoway has been in discussions with Hydro-QuÃ©bec regarding development of a power line from 

the north, and has also investigated the option of bringing a power line from the south. Consideration of the 

potential for local small-scale hydroelectric development is also under way. Potential routes, timing and financing 

options for these power line developments are being evaluated. 

5.3.3 Transport 

The airport facilities at LG-4 and Chibougamau, and the fixed-wing float bases in Mistissini, TÃ©miscamie and 

Mirage are typically used as staging areas for mobilization of equipment and personnel to the Project site. 

5.3.4 Water 

Depending on the immediate requirements and the relevant usage permits, process water may be sourced from 

local lakes or recirculated from surface facilities such as the processed kimberlite containment area or the 

underground exploration workings. During the 2007 underground bulk sampling program, three different types of 

processed water were managed on the Foxtrot Property: 

Used water from the LagopÃ¨de camp operation: A water treatment system was set up in 2006 and 

approved by the MinistÃ¨re du DÃ©veloppement durable, de l'Environnement et des Parcs (MDDEP). It 

consists of four series of Enviroâ€“Septic system units connected to a cleaning field established behind the 

campsite.  

Used water from the underground exploration program: A water treatment system approved by the MDDEP 

was set up underground, together with an outside water-settling pond that was monitored by Stornoway 

and reported monthly to the appropriate government agency. This pond was decommissioned in August 

2008 following MDDEP regulations. 

Used water for the DMS operation: This water was completely recirculated from the DMS facility into the 

adjacent settling pond as approved by the MDDEP. DMS process water did not require any specific water 

treatment.

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 22 

At a future development stage, it is most likely that any required process water would be drawn from either 

surface or underground sources (the latter associated with natural inflows of groundwater into the potential open 

pit and/or underground workings), but more likely a combination of both. Current supplies are considered to be 

more than adequate. Recirculation of process water will continue to provide an important source of water and will 

be used to reduce requirements for fresh water.  

The potable water system used for the LagopÃ¨de camp operation is a portable ozone water treatment system, 

Expio, which is manufactured by Aquagenex in Clermont, Quebec. There are two units available on site. The 

system can produce up to 100 gallons (378 L) per day, a sufficient quantity for the operations to date. The water 

is treated under the supervision of a nurse based on site, and a quality control sample is collected on a regular 

basis. 

5.4 Physiography  

Topographic relief within the Foxtrot Property consists of steep-sided hills with rounded tops separated by 

muskeg-covered valleys. Elevations range between 400 masl and 800 masl. Lakes, ponds and small rivers are 

common. 

5.5 Flora and Fauna 

The Foxtrot Property is located in the TaÃ¯ga belt of Northern Quebec. Vegetation consists largely of immature to 

mature black spruce, poplar, alders and muskeg, with increasing proportions of muskeg and black spruce toward 

the north. Animals such as bear, fox, moose, marten and caribou, as well as various species of birds, are 

present in the vicinity of the Foxtrot Property.

6.0 HISTORY 

Diamond exploration commenced in the Foxtrot Property area in 1996, with the formation of a 50:50 joint venture 

between Ashton and SOQUEM. 

Prior to that time, regional exploration had been undertaken for gold and base metals by a number of parties 

using prospecting and geochemical techniques. These activities were limited in scope due to the location of the 

current property between two Archaean volcanic belts, an area that was considered to be non-prospective for 

traditional gold and base metal targets. Both BHP Billiton and De Beers Canada Exploration have conducted 

regional diamond exploration programs in the general area of the current Foxtrot Property, but results are  

not public. Although there had been scattered small-scale claim blocks throughout the area explored by the 

Ashton-SOQUEM joint venture, no large-scale land acquisition had occurred prior to the August 2000 grant of 

Mineral Exploration Licences PEM 1555 and 1556. 

Initial stage exploration by the joint venture comprised heavy mineral sampling that defined a number of areas 

with anomalous indicator mineral counts. Geophysical surveys over the geochemical anomalies were completed, 

using fixed-wing airborne, magnetic surveys, and ground geophysical surveys. 

Core drill testing of these targets led to the discovery of the Renard 1 and Renard 2 kimberlites in  

September 2001, the Renard 3, Renard 4, Renard 5 and Renard 6 kimberlites in March and April 2002, 

Renard 7 in August 2002, Renard 8 in September 2002, Renard 9, Renard 10 and the 4.2 km long Lynx 

kimberlitic dyke occurrences in 2003, and the 850 m long Hibou kimberlite dyke in 2005. The Renard 5 and 

Renard 6 kimberlites were subsequently determined to be one kimberlitic body, and the occurrence was 

renamed Renard 65. 

Mini-bulk sampling using trenching and core drilling commenced in 2002 on the Renard 2, Renard 3 and 

Renard 4 kimberlites. Additional mini-bulk sampling since that date has been undertaken on the Renard 1, 

Renard 65, Renard 7, Renard 9, Renard 10, Lynx, Lynx South and Hibou kimberlites.  Mini-bulk samples of 

kimberlite boulders collected down-ice of the Lynx and Hibou kimberlites have also been completed. 

During 2004, a conceptual, order of magnitude, tonnage and grade estimate was prepared for the combined 

Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4 and Renard 65 kimberlites, by Wardrop Engineering Inc. of Vancouver, BC 

(Maunala, 2004). This estimate included valuation of Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4 and Renard 65 diamonds 

recovered through RC sampling. 

Additional exploration resulted in the discovery of the North Anomaly kimberlite dyke in 2005 and the Southeast 

Anomaly and G04-296 kimberlite dykes in 2006. An occurrence of kimberlitic float material was also discovered 

north of the Renard pipe cluster. 

Bulk sampling commenced in 2006, testing the Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4, Renard 65 and Renard 9 

kimberlites. Samples were sourced from trench, drill core, RC drill chips and underground. The underground 

exploration workings comprised a portal and the excavation of an inclined ramp to a depth of approximately 55 m 

below surface. Horizontal drifts were driven to access the Renard 2 and Renard 3 kimberlites. A modular  

10-tonne-per-hour dense media separation (DMS) test facility was erected on the Foxtrot Property close to 

Renard 2 and Renard 3, to treat the material from the bulk sampling.

Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 24 

In December 2008, an economic assessment study jointly undertaken by Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited  

(Agnico-Eagle) and AMEC, was completed and formed the 2008 NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Preliminary 

Assessment of the Renard Project authored by Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc (Lecuyer et al., 

2008). 

Agnico-Eagle was responsible for mining, cost estimating and financial analysis. Elements of the Agnico-Eagle 

mining study, such as cost estimation, were completed to a pre-feasibility standard. Agnico-Eagle is a leading 

mine developer in the province of Quebec and Stornoway's largest shareholder. AMEC designed the DMS 

facility, and prepared the Mineral Resource Estimate. Given the more conceptual nature of the mine plan, and 

inclusion of Inferred Resources from AMEC's Mineral Resource Estimate used in the study, the two studies 

combined comprise a Preliminary Assessment under the definitions contained within NI 43-101. An audit of the 

Agnico-Eagle study and economic analysis was completed by Scott Wilson RPA, as independent Qualified 

Persons for the 2008 NI 43-101 report. 

No production has been carried out on the property.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Project area is located within the eastern portion of the Superior Craton (Superior Structural Province) 

(Figure 7.1). The Superior Province forms the Archaean core of the Canadian Shield, and is the largest 

contiguous region of Archaean crust remaining on the globe. It is considered to be an amalgamation of small 

continental fragments of Meso-Archaean age and Neo-Archaean oceanic plates, with a complex history of 

aggregation between 2.72 Ga and 2.68 Ga. Since about 2.6 Ga, the Province has been tectonically stable 

(Percival, 2006).  

The Superior Province is surrounded by provinces of Paleo-Proterozoic age on the west, north and east 

(Churchill Province), and Meso-Proterozoic age (Grenville Province) on the southeast. Margins of the Superior 

Province were affected during Paleo-Proterozoic and Meso-Proterozoic tectonism. Proterozoic and younger 

activity is limited to rifting of the margins, emplacement of numerous mafic dyke swarms, compressional 

reactivation and large-scale rotation at ca. 1.9 Ga, and failed rifting at ca. 1.1 Ga (Percival, 2006). Figure 7.2 

shows the Archaean and Proterozoic rocks in the general region of the Foxtrot Property. 

Quaternary glacial cover in the area was controlled by the New Quebec Ice Divide. From the divide, ice flowed 

north and northeast toward Ungava Bay and west to southwest toward Hudson Bay. Glacial lineaments are well 

developed and widespread. Eskers and hummocky to discontinuous, unmoulded, ground moraine deposits are 

also common.  

There are five episodes of kimberlitic volcanism in Quebec (Moorhead et al., 2003); from south to north, the 

kimberlite fields are:  

TÃ©miscamingue:  six diatreme facies pipes intruding the Pontiac Subprovince. Two age dates, 125 Ma  

(Rbâ€“Sr) and 142 Ma (Uâ€“Pb) have been obtained. Kimberlites are hosted in the northwest-trending 

TÃ©miscaming structural zone. 

Desmaraisville:  five hypabyssal pipes and numerous dykes located in the central portion of the Abitibi 

Subprovince. Age date of 1104 Ma (Rbâ€“Sr phlogopite). Hosted in the Waswanipiâ€“Saguenay Tectonic Zone; 

pipes are in close proximity to northeast-trending Proterozoic dykes. 

Otish:  at least 12 pipes intruding the northeast portion of Opatica and Opinaca Subprovinces. Age  

dates range from 550.0 + 3.5 Ma at Beaver Lake to 640.5 + 28 Ma at Renard. The kimberlite field is 

associated with the southern end of the Mistassini-Lemoyne structural zone, and near-northwest, and 

northeast-trending Proterozoic diabase dykes. 

Wemindji:  kimberlitic sills intruding Archaean-age gneisses of La Grande Subprovince, located at the 

western end of the Wemindjiâ€“Caniapiscau structural zone where it intersects the northeasterly projection of 

the Kapuskasing zone. 

Torngat: diamond-bearing dykes recognized in the Paleo-Proterozoic Rae Province near the Archaean 

Nain Craton. These dykes were classified as carbonatized ultramafic lamprophyres and dated at 550 Ma. 

The Renard Cluster is considered to be part of the Otish kimberlitic volcanic event.

2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 28 

7.2 Project Geology 

The description of Project geology below is based on O'Connor and LÃ©pine (2006). 

The Project area lies on the southeastern portion of the Superior Structural Province bordered by Proterozoic 

rocks of the Labrador Trough in the east and the Grenville Province in the south (Figure 7.1). This portion of the 

Superior Craton is sometimes referred to as the "Ungava Craton". Proterozoic rocks of the Labrador Fold Belt in 

the east, the Cape Smith Fold Belt in the north and the Grenville Province in the south surround the Project area. 

Northern portions of the Project area consist of north-northwest trending, plutonic and gneissic terranes. Based 

on metamorphic grade, mineralogy, lithology and aeromagnetics, the terranes appear to vary in width from 

70 km to 150 km (Percival et al., 1994). 

The Foxtrot Property is situated between the La Grande greenstone (volcanic) belt to the north and the Eastmain 

greenstone (volcanic) belt to the south. Granite-gneiss and retrograde granulite gneiss are the predominant 

lithologies, with lesser amounts of granite and granodiorite. Contained within the gneiss are relict 

metasedimentary and metavolcanic rock assemblages along with associated mafic and ultramafic intrusive 

rocks. The Otish Mountain and Mistassini groups of Proterozoic, clastic, metasedimentary rocks overlie the 

Archean lithologies, marginal to the Grenville Province. Mafic and ultramafic intrusive rocks of variable affinities 

are more common in the southeast than in the southwest. 

Graniteâ€“gneiss and retrograde granulite gneisses of sedimentary origin are the predominant lithologies in the 

Property area; however, lesser granite and granodiorite may also be present. The gneisses may contain relict 

metasedimentary and metavolcanic rock assemblages, as well as associated mafic and ultramafic intrusive 

rocks. Minor linear belts of supracrustal metavolcanic rocks occur throughout the area, generally trending  

east-west or west-northwest. Northwest-trending, Proterozoic Mistassini Swarm diabase and gabbro dykes up to 

30 m wide cross-cut all lithologies. Isolated outliers of Proterozoic clastic metasedimentary rocks are present in 

the area (O'Connor and LÃ©pine, 2006). 

Metamorphic grade within the Foxtrot area is primarily amphibolite facies with local granulite facies being 

reported near Lac Minto (Percival et al., 1994). Higher-grade lithologies in the north are interpreted as 

supracrustal relicts dating to 3.1 Ga. Granite and granite gneiss are dated at 2.7 Ga and local felsic and 

intermediate intrusive rocks are dated at 2.5 Ga. 

Glacial overburden within the Foxtrot Property can be up to 30 m thick, but is on average 12 m thick in the area 

of the Renard Cluster. Glacial deposits consist of till, eskers, moraine and post-glacial sediments, and their 

orientation reflects ice transport from the north-northeast. 

In this report, reference is made to the Renard Core Area, which is defined as a 37-ha area that contains the 

Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4, Renard 65 and Renard 9 kimberlite pipes as well as the Lynx and Hibou dyke 

systems.  Kimberlites are discussed individually in Section 9 of this report.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

There are two types of diamond deposits: primary and secondary. Primary deposits are those in which the 

diamonds remain inside the original host rock (usually kimberlite) that conveyed them to the surface. Secondary 

deposits are formed when the diamonds are eroded from the host rock and concentrated by the action of water 

into alluvial deposits (in rivers) or marine deposits (in beaches). The Renard kimberlites are primary deposits.  

8.1 Overview of Primary Diamond Deposits 

Primary diamond deposits such as kimberlites and lamproites have produced over 50% of the world's diamonds. 

The remainder was derived from recent to ancient placer deposits that originated from the erosion of kimberlite 

and/or lamproite. Although diamondiferous kimberlite and lamproite comprise most of the economic diamond 

deposits, other diamond-bearing rocks have also been discovered and are the subject of numerous academic 

papers. Such diamond-bearing rocks include ultramafic lamprophyres (aillikites) in Canada and volcaniclastic 

komatiites in French Guiana (Capdevila et al., 1999). It has been established by the scientific community that 

diamonds are not genetically related to kimberlite or lamproite but that kimberlite and lamproite intrusives serve 

as a transport mechanism for bringing diamonds to surface (Kirkley et al. 1991) from the mantle.  

Clifford (1966) and Janse (1991) stated that a majority of economic diamondiferous kimberlites occur in stable 

Archaean age cratonic material that has not undergone any thermal or deformational event since 2.5 Ga. Such 

Archaean age cratons include the Kaapvaal, Congo and West African cratons (Africa), Superior and Slave 

Provinces (Canada), East European Craton (Russia, Finland), and the West, North and South Australian 

cratons. The only exceptions to date are the Argyle and Ellendale mines of Australia, which occurred in 

Proterozoic-age, remobilized, cratonic material. 

To date, over 6,000 known kimberlite and lamproite occurrences have been discovered, of which over 1,000 are 

diamondiferous. Some of the well-known diamondiferous kimberlites/lamproites currently being mined include 

Argyle (lamproite) in Australia; Orapa and Jwaneng (kimberlites) in Botswana; Jubilee, Udachnaya and Mir 

(kimberlites) in Russia; Venetia (kimberlite) in South Africa, and the Ekati and Diavik clusters (kimberlites) in 

Canada.  

Economic diamond kimberlite and/or lamproite pipes generally range from less than 0.4 ha to 146 ha in surface 

area, with the maximum size being more than 200 ha (for example, Catoca, Angola). Economic diamond grades 

can range from 3.5 cpht to 600 cpht. 

8.2 Kimberlite-Hosted Deposits 

The following discussion of kimberlite types and deposits is taken directly from a publication on ore deposit 

models by Mitchell (1991). 

Kimberlites remain the principal source of primary diamonds despite the discovery of high-grade deposits in 

lamproites. Recent mineralogical and Rbâ€“Sr isotopic studies have shown that two varieties of kimberlite exist: 

Group 1, or olivine-rich monticellite serpentine calcite kimberlites; and

Effective Date:  December 8, 2009

Group 2, or micaceous kimberlites (predominantly occur in southern Africa). 

"Group 1" kimberlites are complex, hybrid rocks consisting of minerals that may be derived from: 

Fragmentation of upper mantle xenoliths (including diamond); 

Megacryst or discrete nodule suite; or 

Primary phenocrysts and groundmass minerals. 

The contribution to the overall mineralogy from each source varies widely and significantly influences the 

petrographic character of the rocks. Consequently, Group 1 kimberlites comprise a petrological clan of rocks that 

exhibit wide differences in appearance and mineralogy as a consequence of the above variation, coupled with 

differentiation and diverse styles of emplacement of the magma. 

Figure 8.1 illustrates an idealized South African kimberlite magmatic system, showing the relationships between 

effusive rocks, diatremes, and hypabyssal rocks. Currently, three texturalâ€“genetic groups of kimberlite are 

recognized, each being associated with a particular style of magmatic activity in such a system. These are:  

Crater facies; 

Diatreme facies; and 

Root Zone facies. 

Rocks belonging to each facies differ in their petrology and primary mineralogy, but may contain similar 

xenocrystal and megacrystal assemblages. 

With a few exceptions, such as the Finsch Kimberlite Mine in the Republic of South Africa and the Dokolwayo 

Kimberlite Mine in Swaziland, most of the well-known diamondiferous kimberlites in South Africa and elsewhere 

are Group 1 kimberlites. The Renard kimberlites are considered to be Group 1 kimberlites. 

The Renard kimberlites are interpreted to be steep-sided, pipe-like structures with irregular to elongate shapes in 

plan view. Surface expressions vary between 0.1 ha and 1.7 ha. The Renard Cluster is mainly composed of 

diatreme-like kimberlitic breccia lithologies and hypabyssal kimberlitic material. No crater material is noted in the 

Renards. 

The Lynx, Hibou, North Anomaly, Southeast Anomaly and G04-296 hypabyssal dykes are interpreted to be 

intrusions of kimberlitic material that did not vent to the earth's surface at the time of emplacement.

9.0 MINERALIZATION 

The Renard kimberlite pipes and Lynx and Hibou dykes were emplaced into granitic and gneissic host rocks, 

and contain diamonds of potential economic interest. The bodies comprise a late Neo-Proterozoic to Cambrian 

kimberlite field in Quebec (Girard, 2001; Moorhead et al, 2002; Letendre et al., 2003).  

To date, nine kimberlite pipes have been identified over a 2 km2 area in the Renard Cluster (Renard 1 to 

Renard 10; with Renard 5 and Renard 6 forming one body, referred to as Renard 65). The kimberlite pipes are 

typically spaced between 50 m and 500 m from each other (Figure 9.1). Geophysical data and drill information 

from delineation and bulk sampling programs indicate that, in general, most of the Renard kimberlites are 

irregular and elliptical in plan view. Surface areas of the kimberlite portion of the pipes range from 0.1 ha to 

1.7 ha. A summary of each pipe is presented in Table 9-1. Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4, Renard 9 and 

Renard 65 are the subject of the Mineral Resource Estimate in Section 17 of this report. At the present time, the 

other kimberlite pipes are considered either too small, have low apparent diamond content, or are not sufficiently 

sampled or understood to support mineral resource estimation. Additional work on these other bodies may be 

undertaken at a later date; however, no work plan or budget has been prepared at this time. 

Two laterally extensive kimberlite dyke systems, known as the Lynx and Hibou dykes, have been identified to the 

west and northwest of the pipe cluster, respectively (Figure 9.1). Portions of both dykes are included in the 

mineral resource estimation. Additional dyke-like kimberlites have been discovered elsewhere on the property. 

These are not included in mineral resource estimation but may warrant additional work at a later date. No work 

plan or budget has been prepared for this work at this time. 

This section focuses on the internal geology of the pipes which is fundamental to the resource estimation 

process.

2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 35 

9.1 Renard Kimberlite Pipes 

9.1.1 General Geology 

Kimberlite nomenclature has evolved several times throughout the work carried out on the Renard kimberlites. 

The terminology used at this time to describe the rock types in these kimberlites is in accordance with that used 

in the most recent scientific literature. Within this report the following terms and definitions are used: 

Massive Volcaniclastic Kimberlite (MVK): a general term that includes kimberlite classified texturally as 

tuffisitic kimberlite breccia. 

Coherent Kimberlite (CK): a general term that refers to kimberlite that has not been fragmented (i.e. the 

magma broken apart as a result of emplacement processes). In general, the term coherent kimberlite is 

used to refer to large, pipe-infilling events of this nature. 

Hypabyssal Kimberlite (HK): a more specific textural term for CK. Typically used here to describe the 

detailed texture of a CK rock and commonly used when referring to dykes or irregular intrusions. 

Tuffisitic Kimberlite Breccia (TKB): a more specific textural term for MVK. Characterized by microlitic 

clinopyroxene in the matrix of the rock. 

Transitional Kimberlite: this refers to kimberlite that shows textures of both volcaniclastic kimberlite and 

coherent kimberlite. A small "t" denotes a transitional textured HK or TK when describing rock-types (e.g.,

HKt or TKt). 

The Renard kimberlite pipes comprise root zone to diatreme facies rocks characterized by a complex internal 

geology. These pipes can be classified as "typical" South-African-style kimberlites (Hawthorne, J.B., 1973, 

Clement and Skinner, 1979, Clement, 1982 and Field and Scott Smith, 1999). In most pipes, with the exception 

of Renard 3 and Renard 10, the dominant phase is a MVK that can be classified as "tuffisitic" kimberlitic breccia 

(TKB). In general, these TKBs are extensively altered and have a massive texture. They consist of varying 

amounts of olivine, juvenile clasts and country rock xenoliths that are poorly sorted, typically loosely packed and 

less commonly clast supported, all set within a highly altered interclast matrix. In many pipes a secondary  

pipe-filling phase is present that is typically a more coherent or transitional kimberlite characterized by lower 

country rock xenolith content and higher olivine content set within a dominantly crystalline groundmass. In all 

bodies, HK is present as both dykes and irregularly shape intrusions that are found within each pipe infilling 

phase, between contacts of phases and along pipe margins. These are typically considered later stage 

intrusions. The HK intrusions can vary in thickness from a few centimetres to several metres and, in the case of 

the Lynx and Hibou dyke system, for example, they are laterally extensive.

The Renard bodies are all associated with extensive cracked country rock (CCR) "halos" and with the exception 

of Renard 3, Renard 7 and Renard 8, have a significant marginal country rock breccia (CRB) peripheral to the 

main pipe infills. The CCR surrounding the pipes consist of both broken and solid country rock with minor 

amounts of HK dykes and veins throughout. Minor zones of extensively fractured to brecciated country rock are 

also present in this unit. The CRB typically lies between the main kimberlite units and the CCR and is 

characterized by dominantly broken and pulverized country rock, with an overall dilution of 95% or greater. CRB 

contains from 0% - 5% kimberlite, present as olivine in the pulverized country rock matrix. Locally, the CRB may

also contain more than 10% diamond-bearing kimberlitic material, in the form of late-stage, cross-cutting  

HK dykes.   

Each Renard kimberlite contains a variety of phases that are distinguishable from one another by differing 

macroscopic and microscopic properties as well as diamond grades. A summary of the various kimberlite 

lithologies present in the Renard bodies is provided in Table 9-2.  

Whole rock trace element compositions suggest that the Renards have a close affinity to Group I kimberlite (after 

Skinner, 1989), with some melnoitic overlap, likely due to contamination by country rock (Birkett et al., 2004). 

However, petrographic analyses of these rocks support Group I kimberlite classification.  

Previous U-Pb dating of groundmass perovskite in HK dykes within Renard 1 suggested an emplacement age of 

631.6 Â± 3.5 Ma (Birkett et al., 2004). Recent data obtained for the main rock-types in Renards 2 and 3 using the 

same method suggest an emplacement age of 640.5 Â± 2.8 Ma.

9.1.2 Renard 2 

The Renard 2 kimberlite is a mid-sized kimberlite pipe within the Renard Cluster. It is interpreted as a  

diatreme-zone kimberlite with irregularities in the external shape of the kimberlite near the surface, but an overall 

smooth and tapering shape when considering the emplacement envelope (the CRB and CCR). The shape of the 

kimberlite portion of the pipe expands with depth. The internal geology of Renard 2 was established using 

geological logs of both core and reverse circulation drill holes combined with detailed mapping of the 

underground drift and petrographic and geochemical studies (Figures 9.2 and 9.3). A detailed description of the 

geology and emplacement history of Renard 2 is described in Fitzgerald et al. (2009).  

Renard 2 consists of two main pipe-infills: an MVK referred to as Kimb2a and a transitional CK referred to as 

Kimb2b. The two main infills exhibit contrasting primary textures: olivine abundances and populations, country 

rock xenolith abundances and populations, and diamond contents. The kimberlite is surrounded by extensive 

marginal CRB and CCR. In addition to these, HK dykes and intrusions (referred to as Kimb2c) of varying 

thickness are found throughout the body, along the pipe contacts, within the marginal breccia and in the cracked 

country rock (Fitzgerald et al., 2009). 

Each kimberlite unit can be described as follows: 

Kimb2a is volumetrically the most significant kimberlite rock type infilling the pipe, accounting for 56% of total 

kimberlite by volume. It is extensively altered, massive and can be texturally classified as a TKB (Clement and 

Skinner, 1979; Clement, 1982; Clement and Reid, 1989; Field and Scott Smith, 1999; Hetman, 2008). This blue 

to blue-green rock consists of olivine, juvenile clasts and country rock xenoliths that are poorly sorted, typically 

loosely packed and less commonly clast supported and set within a highly altered interclast matrix. Olivine 

macrocrysts comprise 10% of the rock and are typically medium-grained to rarely coarse-grained. Juvenile clasts 

are common, have sharp margins and are of both cored and uncored varieties (Webb, 2006). Primary 

groundmass minerals in juvenile clasts include phlogopite, spinel and perovskite. This unit commonly contains 

50% - 75% fresh to moderately altered granitoid and lesser gneissic country rock xenoliths (granitoid dominate). 

These are set within a non-crystalline matrix that comprise clays, serpentine and microlitic clinopyroxene. This 

rock can be classified mineralogically as a phlogopite kimberlite. 

Kimb2b is the second most volumetrically significant kimberlite rock type, accounting for 44% of total kimberlite 

by volume. This rock is a moderately altered, massive and texturally variable CK that displays both coherent and 

rarer volcaniclastic (i.e. TKB) textures. This brown rock consists of olivine, country rock xenoliths and rare 

juvenile clasts that are poorly sorted and set within a dominantly crystalline groundmass. Olivine macrocrysts 

comprise 15% - 30% of the rock and are medium- to coarse-grained with common very coarse grains. Juvenile 

clasts are relatively rare and, where observed, typically have diffuse margins. Primary groundmass minerals 

include phlogopite, perovskite, spinel, carbonate and rare monticellite. Secondary minerals in the groundmass 

include serpentine, clays and microlitic clinopyroxene. This unit commonly contains 20% - 50% moderately to 

strongly altered granitoid and gneissic country rock xenoliths (gneissic appear to dominate). This rock can be 

classified mineralogically as a monticellite phlogopite kimberlite.

Contacts between these two rock types are sharp and commonly highlighted by HK dyke intrusions, as well as 

changes in the proportion of country rock xenoliths in Kimb2a. The contrasting textural and component features 

described above and the sharp nature of the contacts, combined with the difference in diamond grade, supports 

interpretation of the two pipe infills as two distinct rock-types emplaced during two separate volcanic events. The 

emplacement of Kimb2b is thought to have preceded that of Kimb2a based on the contact relationships between 

these two phases and the relative distribution of these within the pipe, as it is often identified as remnant blocks 

within Kimb2a near surface and is present marginally to Kimb2a at depth. 

Coherent kimberlite also occurs in Renard 2 in the form of late-stage HK dykes and irregular intrusions (referred 

to as Kimb2c), ranging in thickness from a few centimetres up to 15 m. Kimb2c is black to dark-green coloured 

with medium- to coarse-grained and, commonly, very coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. The various  

HK intrusions include a spectrum of primary groundmass mineral assemblages, ranging from monticellite 

dominated to phlogopite dominated, each additionally consisting of common carbonate, spinel and perovskite. 

This unit does not commonly contain country rock xenoliths but, where present, comprises < 5% of the unit and 

are strongly altered. 

Also modelled in Renard 2 is the CRB-2a unit. This internal country rock breccia was identified during mapping 

of the underground exposure and drill core logging, and consists of large fresh blocks of white granitoid and 

gneiss with a minor matrix component manifested as < 5 cm wide, blue coloured veins and Kimb2a 

intersections. Country rock xenolith content is 95% or greater. The presence of the Kimb2a intersections, overall 

blue colour of the matrix, and similarities in appearance, type and alteration state of the country rock xenoliths, 

suggest that this CRB represents a highly diluted zone of Kimb2a. Petrographic examination of matrix zones 

supports this interpretation. 

The kimberlite in Renard 2 is surrounded entirely by extensive marginal CRB and CCR. The CRB has a 

maximum width of approximately 100 m near surface and extends the full depth of the body on the north side of 

the pipe. The CCR is present in the upper portion of the pipe and is spatially associated with the Kimb2a unit. 

More HK dykes are present within the CCR unit on the western side of the body as compared to the eastern 

side. 

9.1.3 Renard 3 

The Renard 3 kimberlite is one of the smallest kimberlite pipes within the Renard Cluster. It is interpreted as a 

complex, steep-sided, root-zone kimberlite, with several irregularities in the external shape. The geology of this 

kimberlite has been determined using detailed logging of drill core, mapping of the underground decline walls, 

and results of petrographic and geochemical studies (Figures 9.2 and 9.3).  

The current 3D model of Renard 3 has two possible feeder zones and consists of six kimberlite rock types in 

order of volumetric significance: Kimb3d, Kimb3g, Kimb3i, Kimb3b, Kimb3h, and Kimb3f. Currently, the Kimb3d 

and Kimb3g units are modelled together as one 3D solid, based on their comparative mineralogy and 

abundances of groundmass minerals observed through thin section analysis, as well as similar grade and 

diamond counts (stones per tonne) obtained from underground sampling. A small CRB zone exists on the upper, 

southern portion of the pipe, in association with the Kimb3b phase. More extensive CCR discontinuously 

surrounds the majority of the kimberlite pipe margin. In addition to the six main kimberlite rock types infilling the

pipe, a number of HK dykes and intrusions (Kimb3c) occur throughout the body, along the pipe contacts, within 

the marginal breccia and in the cracked country rock. 

Each kimberlite unit can be described as follows: 

Kimb3d is a coherent (HK/HK(t)), black to dark brown kimberlite with medium- to coarse-grained and common 

very coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. This unit commonly contains 20% - 40% strongly altered, dark green to 

black-rimmed granitoid and lesser gneissic country rock xenoliths with bleached centres. The matrix is crystalline 

and dominated by primary groundmass minerals consisting of phlogopite, carbonate, perovskite, spinel and rare 

monticellite. Texturally this rock is classified as a CK and mineralogically as a phlogopite kimberlite.  

Kimb3g is a transitional volcaniclastic (HKt/TKt), dark brown to mottled-brown-green kimberlite with  

medium- to coarse-grained and rare very coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. This unit contains approximately 

30% - 50% granitoid and gneissic country rock xenoliths moderately altered with creamy green and yellow rims. 

Juvenile clast abundance is variable and exhibits common thick selvages. The matrix is non-crystalline to 

crystalline and contains both primary groundmass minerals and patchy zones of secondary alteration minerals. 

Texturally this rock is classified as an HKt/TKt and mineralogically as a phlogopite kimberlite.  Kimb3d and 

Kimb3g are modelled as one unit in 3D and together account for 37% of the kimberlite by volume. 

Kimb3i is a coherent (HK), black kimberlite with medium- to coarse-grained and common very coarse-grained 

macrocrystic olivine. This unit contains on average 10% - 20% strongly altered granitoid and gneissic country 

rock xenoliths, with alteration style varying from entirely bleached and dark-green coloured to having black rims 

with bleached centres. The matrix is uniform, crystalline and dominated by primary groundmass minerals 

consisting of carbonate, phlogopite, perovskite, spinel and rare apatite. Texturally this rock is classified as a  

CK and mineralogically as a phlogopite carbonate kimberlite. Kimb3i represents 20% of total kimberlite by 

volume.

Kimb3b is a blue to blue-grey volcaniclastic (TK/TKt) kimberlite breccia with fine- to medium-grained, and less 

commonly coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. This unit contains altered pink to patchy green granitoid 

xenoliths, with lesser gneissic xenoliths that are fresh to moderately altered green. Xenolith content varies from 

55% - 75%. Juvenile clasts are common and are both cored and uncored. The matrix is dominated by 

clinopyroxene, serpentine and clay, contributing to its blue-grey colour. Texturally this rock can be classified as a 

TKB and mineralogically as a phlogopite kimberlite. Kimb3b represents 16% of total kimberlite by volume.  

Kimb3h is a coherent (HK) black kimberlite with medium- to coarse-grained and rare, very coarse-grained 

macrocrystic olivine. This unit contains 15% - 25% strongly altered, dark green to black-rimmed granitoid and 

gneissic country rock xenoliths with bleached centres. The matrix is crystalline with primary groundmass 

minerals consisting of phlogopite, carbonate, spinel and perovskite. Texturally this rock is classified as a CK and 

mineralogically as a carbonate phlogopite kimberlite. Kimb3h represents 14% of total kimberlite by volume. 

Kimb3f is a volcaniclastic (TKt/HKt) brown to mottled green-blue kimberlite with medium-grained and common 

coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. This unit contains 35% - 50% gneissic and granitoid country rock xenoliths, 

moderately altered with creamy yellow to green rims. Juvenile clasts with thick selvages are abundant, however, 

are commonly diffuse and are not always easily observed, particularly in darker, more magmatic zones. Autoliths 

of HK are abundant and, in general, this unit contains the highest percentage of autoliths compared to other

units in the Renard 3 body. Texturally this rock is classified as a TKt/HKt and mineralogically as a phlogopite 

kimberlite. Kimb3f represents 13% of total kimberlite by volume. 

Coherent kimberlite also occurs in Renard 3 in the form of late-stage HK dykes and irregular intrusions  

(Kimb3c). They range in thickness from a few centimetres up to 20 m. Kimb3c is a black to dark-green HK with 

medium- to coarse-grained, and commonly, very coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. This unit does not 

commonly contain country rock xenoliths, but where present, they comprises < 5% of the unit. 

CRB is found only in the southern, uppermost part of the pipe and therefore comprises only a minor portion of 

the entire kimberlite pipe. It has a maximum width of 45 m, wrapping around the southern end of the pipe, and 

extends vertically for almost 175 m. The kimberlite is surrounded from top to bottom by discontinuous CCR.  

The emplacement history of Renard 3 is complex and not fully understood at this time. However, textural 

features of the rocks, contact relationships and distribution of the rock types in the pipe suggest that Kimb3b and 

Kimb3f were emplaced early during pipe development, and Kimb3d, Kimb3g and Kimb3i were emplaced later. 

9.1.4 Renard 4 

The Renard 4 kimberlite is one of the larger kimberlite pipes within the Renard Cluster. It is interpreted as a 

diatreme-zone kimberlite with minor irregularities in the external shape. The geology of this kimberlite has been 

determined using detailed logging of drill core and mapping of the surface trench (Figures 9.2 and 9.3).  

The Renard 4 pipe contains three kimberlite geological units: an MVK, referred to as Kimb4a, a transitional CK, 

referred to as Kimb4b, and a texturally complex MVK, referred to as Kimb4d. In the current 3D model there is 

also a unit referred to as FWR (further work required) on the eastern edge of the body that is currently 

unclassified. It may represent a more highly diluted Kimb4a or Kimb4d. A significant marginal CRB and CCR 

surround the main kimberlite. The CCR adjoins at depth with that of Renard 9, along the southern margin of the 

pipe. In addition to the three main pipe infills, a number of HK dykes and irregular intrusions occur throughout the 

body, along the pipe contacts, within the marginal breccia and in the cracked country rock. 

Each kimberlite unit can be described as follows: 

Kimb4a is an MVK that can be further classified as a TKB. It is blue to green coloured with medium-grained and, 

less commonly, fine-grained macrocrystic olivine. A characteristic feature of this unit is that the olivine 

macrocrysts are commonly carbonatized, which is not typical of other Renard TKB's. Juvenile clasts are 

common and are of both cored and uncored varieties. The unit contains 50% - 80% granitoid and gneiss country 

rock xenoliths that are fresh to moderately altered. The matrix is dominated by clay, serpentine carbonate and 

clinopyroxene, contributing to its blue-green colour. Kimb4a has been divided into two sub-types based on subtle 

differences in xenolith character and mineralogy: Kimb4a-1 is a blue-grey rock with fresh xenoliths and is 

mineralogically classified as a phlogopite monticellite kimberlite; Kimb4a-2 is a green rock with dark pink, 

hematized xenoliths that can be classified mineralogically as a phlogopite spinel monticellite kimberlite. Further 

work is required in order to determine if in fact these are two separate phases, or if the differences in the rock 

characteristics are due to variations within one phase. Kimb4a represents 70% of total kimberlite by volume. 

Kimb4b is a transitional volcaniclastic (HK/HKt/TKt), mottled light to dark brown kimberlite with  

medium- to coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. Juvenile clasts are present and typically appear as diffuse

magmatic domains within a more altered groundmass. Their abundance is variable and they exhibit thick 

selvages. Country rock xenoliths are fresh to more commonly, strongly altered granitoid and gneiss, with content 

ranging from 25% - 50%. The groundmass varies from crystalline to non-crystalline. Mantle nodules are very 

common and characterize this unit. Mineralogically this rock is classified as a perovskite monticellite phlogopite 

kimberlite. Kimb4b represents 21% of total kimberlite by volume. 

Kimb4d is a volcaniclastic to transitional (TK/TKt), dark blue kimberlite with medium-grained and, less commonly, 

fine- and coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. It is a highly variable kimberlite texturally that contains common 

coherent (HK) and transitional coherent (HKt) intervals within an overall MVK texture. These more coherent 

zones occur as both dykes and possible autoliths of undiluted Kimb4d. Juvenile clasts are both uncored and 

cored varieties, some with diffuse margins. Country rock xenoliths are fresh to moderately altered granitoid and 

gneiss and represent 40% - 75% of the rock. The matrix is dominated by serpentine, carbonate, clay minerals, 

clinopyroxene microlites and mica. Mantle indicator minerals are common and notably more abundant than in 

the other units. Mineralogically this rock can be classified as a phlogopite spinel monticellite kimberlite. Kimb4d 

represents 6% of total kimberlite by volume. 

Contacts between these rock types are sharp and commonly highlighted by HK dyke intrusions. Contrasting 

textural and component features described above and the sharp nature of the contacts, combined with the 

difference in diamond grade, supports interpretation of the three pipe infills as distinct rock-types emplaced 

during three separate volcanic events. The emplacement of Kimb4d is thought to have preceded that of Kimb4a 

based on the contact relationships between these two phases and the fact that Kimb4d appears as a remnant 

block of kimberlite that does not extend to depth. A second pipe kimberlite emplacement event resulted in the 

removal of a significant volume of Kimb4d and infilling of the diatreme by Kimb4a. Finally, the Kimb4b unit 

removed a portion of the Kimb4a unit and infilled the south eastern portion of the pipe. Emplacement of Kimb4a 

is thought to have preceded formation of Kimb4b based on the presence of a remnant block of Kimb4a within the 

Kimb4b unit. 

CK also occurs in Renard 4 in the form of late-stage HK dykes and irregular intrusions (Kimb4c). They range  

in thickness from a few centimetres up to 34 m. Kimb4c is a black to dark-green HK with medium- to  

coarse-grained and, commonly, very coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. This unit does not commonly contain 

country rock xenoliths but, where present, they comprise < 5% of the unit and are strongly altered. 

CRB is present dominantly in the north and west portion of the body, with smaller blocks in the south and east. 

The marginal breccia is both vertically and horizontally extensive, reaching a maximum width of 60 m adjacent to 

the body near surface and extending almost 380 m vertically. CCR surrounds the kimberlite from top to bottom 

discontinuously, however it is more extensive on the southern side of the body. The southern part of the 

Renard 4 CCR merges with the northern side of the Renard 9 CCR at approximately 225 m depth below surface 

and was modelled as one continuous unit. 

9.1.5 Renard 9 

The Renard 9 kimberlite is one of the smaller kimberlite pipes within the Renard Cluster. It is interpreted as a 

lower diatreme to root-zone kimberlite with an irregular external shape that dips to the east with depth. The 

internal geology of Renard 9 has been established using geological logs of both drill core and reverse circulation 

drill holes (Figures 9.2 and 9.3).  



2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 45 

Renard 9 consists of two main pipe-infills: an MVK referred to as Kimb9a and a volumetrically minor (2%) 

transitional CK referred to as Kimb9b. In general, the texture of these kimberlite phases change from east to 

west across the body: Kimb9b changes from more HK-like in the east to more transitional TK-like to the west; 

and the dilution of Kimb9a changes significantly from east to west. An extensive CRB is present on the western 

side of the body, across both the length and height of the body. The CRB is spatially associated with the Kimb9a 

unit. Also peripheral to the kimberlite is significant CCR, which joins with that of Renard 4 at depth. In addition to 

these units, hypabyssal kimberlite (HK) dykes and intrusions (referred to as Kimb9c) of varying thickness are 

found throughout the body, along the pipe contacts, within the marginal breccia and in the cracked country rock. 

There are two sub-types of HK in Renard 9: Kimb9c-1 is a black, strongly magnetic HK with dyke-like contacts, 

whereas Kimb9c-2 is a grey, very carbonate rich, non-magnetic HK with irregular contacts. Kimb9c-2 may in fact 

represent undiluted Kimb9a, occurring as autoliths throughout the TKB. 

Each kimberlite unit can be described as follows: 

Kimb9a is volumetrically the most significant kimberlite rock type infilling the pipe, accounting for 98% of total 

kimberlite by volume. It is extensively altered, generally massive and can be texturally classified as a TKB. This 

pale-green to grey-green rock consists of olivine, juvenile clasts and country rock xenoliths that are poorly 

sorted, typically loosely packed and less commonly clast, supported and set within a highly altered interclast 

matrix. Olivine macrocrysts are typically fine- to medium-grained with rare coarse grains and are commonly 

altered to serpentine, carbonate and rare pyrite. Two mineralogical types of juvenile clasts are observed in 

Kimb9a. Both have sharp margins and include both cored and uncored varieties. Type one is classified as a 

spinel phlogopite kimberlite and type two as a spinel phlogopite monticellite kimberlite. This unit contains on 

average 60% - 75% fresh to moderately altered granitoid and gneissic country rock xenoliths set within a  

non-crystalline matrix comprising clays, serpentine and microlitic clinopyroxene.  

Kimb9b accounts for only 2% of total kimberlite by volume. The relative abundance of this rock type in the body, 

position and contact relationships suggest that Kimb9b is a remnant kimberlite phase emplaced before Kimb9a. 

This rock is a moderately altered, massive and texturally variable CK that displays both coherent and more rare 

volcaniclastic (i.e. TKB) textures. This brown kimberlite consists of olivine, country rock xenoliths and rare 

juvenile clasts that are poorly sorted and set within a dominantly crystalline groundmass. Olivine macrocrysts are 

medium- to coarse-grained. Juvenile clasts are relatively rare and, where observed, typically have diffuse 

margins. Groundmass minerals consist of perovskite, monticellite and phlogopite, set within an inhomogeneous, 

variably crystallized, interclast matrix dominated by carbonate, clays and microlitic clinopyroxene. This unit 

contains 20% - 50% moderately to strongly altered granitoid and gneissic country rock xenoliths. This rock 

exhibits textures of both MVK and a CK and can be classified mineralogically as a perovskite monticellite 

phlogopite kimberlite. The abundance and character of perovskite and phlogopite are diagnostic for this unit. 

Two types of HK occur in Renard 9; late-stage HK dykes (Kimb9c-1) and irregular intrusions or autoliths 

(Kimb9c-2). These are typically less than 1 m thick in drill core and range from black to dark green to grey 

coloured. Kimb9c-1 can be classified mineralogically as a phlogopite monticellite kimberlite and Kimb9c-2 can be 

classified as a phlogopite spinel monticellite kimberlite with extensive carbonate throughout. This unit does not 

commonly contain country rock xenoliths, but where present, they comprise < 5% of the unit and are strongly 

altered. 



2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE

Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 46 

The Renard 9 kimberlite has an extensive marginal CRB on the western and southern sides of the body, 

spatially associated with Kimb9a. It has a surface width of approximately 30 m and extends the full depth of the 

body. Contacts between this and the Kimb9a unit are typically gradational. Peripheral CCR with rare HK dykes 

discontinuously surrounds the kimberlite and joins with the CCR of Renard 4 at depth.  

9.1.6 Renard 65 

The Renard 65 kimberlite is the largest kimberlite in the Renard Cluster. It is interpreted as a diatreme-zone 

kimberlite with a slightly irregular shape at surface, and tapering gradually with depth. The geology of this 

kimberlite has been determined in a preliminary fashion using examination of field logs of drill core (Figure 9.4).  

Renard 65 consists of four main pipe-infilling kimberlite units: Kimb65a, Kimb65b, Kimb65d and Kimb65e. In 

addition, CRB and CCR surround the main kimberlite pipe infills. The four kimberlitic units have been modelled in 

3D as one kimberlite solid for the purposes of determining a potential mineral deposit so individual volumes are 

not available. In addition, a number of HK dykes and irregular intrusions (Kimb65c) occur throughout the body as 

late-stage intrusions along the pipe contacts and within the CRB and CCR. 

Each kimberlite unit can be described as follows: 

Kimb65a is a pale blue-grey to green-grey volcaniclastic (TK/TKt) kimberlite breccia with fine- to medium-grained 

and, less commonly, coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. This unit contains 50% - 75% fresh to altered, pink to 

patchy-green-coloured granitoid xenoliths, with lesser amounts of gneiss. Juvenile clasts are common and are 

both cored and uncored. Mineralogically this rock can be classified as a phlogopite kimberlite. 

Kimb65b is a coherent (HK/HKt) black to dark brown kimberlite with coarse to very coarse-grained macrocrystic 

olivine. This unit contains 5% - 35% strongly altered, dark-green to black-rimmed gneissic and lesser granitoid 

country rock xenoliths. Mantle nodules are abundant and include harzburgite, peridotite and possible minor 

dunite types. The matrix is crystalline with minor patches of alteration from the digestion of country rock 

xenoliths. 

Kimb65d is a volcaniclastic (HKt/TKt) light to dark brown, occasionally mottled green kimberlite with medium- to 

coarse-grained and, rarely, very coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. This unit contains 30% - 50% (may reach 

up to 70%) granitoid and gneissic country rock xenoliths. These are moderately altered with pale green and 

yellow rims. Juvenile clasts are present, are both cored and uncored, and are typically < 3 cm in size.  

HK autoliths are also present and are round with sharply defined margins. The matrix varies from crystalline to 

non-crystalline, with patchy zones of secondary alteration. 

Kimb65e is a complex, volcaniclastic to coherent (HKt), dark-brown kimberlite with medium- to coarse-grained 

macrocrystic olivine. This unit contains 25% - 55% gneissic and granitoid country rock xenoliths (granite may 

dominate), fresh to moderately altered pale green, with stronger alteration in smaller xenocrysts. The matrix is 

crystalline to patchy crystalline with alteration minerals from xenolith digestion. Its primary groundmass 

mineralogy includes phlogopite, carbonate, spinel and perovskite. 

The HK dykes (Kimb65c) that occur in Renard 65 drill core range in thickness from a few centimetres up to 35 m. 

Kimb65c is a coherent black to dark-green kimberlite with medium- to coarse-grained and, commonly, very 

coarse-grained macrocrystic olivine. This unit does not commonly contain country rock xenoliths, but where 

present, they comprise < 5% of the unit.

around the pipe. CRB is dominant on the western side of the body whereas CCR dominates on the east.

9.2 Other Renard Kimberlite Pipes 

The remaining Renard kimberlite bodies (Renard 1, Renard 7, Renard 8 and Renard 10) are currently not part of 

the economic assessment but are included in the following summary as future work may be undertaken on these 

bodies, though none is planned at this time. 

9.2.1 Renard 1 

The Renard 1 kimberlite is the second largest kimberlite in the Renard Cluster. It is interpreted as a  

diatreme-zone kimberlite with a slightly irregular shape at surface, and tapering gradually with depth. The 

geology of this kimberlite has been determined in a preliminary fashion using 11 drill cores.  

Renard 1 consists of three main pipe-infilling kimberlite units: an MVK referred to as Kimb1a (comprising 61% of 

total kimberlite); a transitional CK referred to as Kimb1b (comprising 27% of total kimberlite) and a large, 

irregular HK intrusion referred to as Kimb1c (comprising 11% of total kimberlite). It is unclear at this time how 

these kimberlites relate temporally, and whether or not they represent a textural change within one kimberlite 

phase or are three distinct phases. In addition to these main infills, a CRB and CCR almost completely surround 

the main kimberlite pipe infills. The CRB is much larger on the western side of the body and the CCR is much 

larger on the eastern side. These are extensive and extend to depth in the kimberlite, however are discontinuous 

around the pipe. A number of HK dykes and irregular intrusions occur throughout the main phases of kimberlite, 

along the pipe contacts and within the marginal CRB and CCR units. These are also referred to as Kimb1c 

because at this time they cannot be distinguished geologically from HK in the large intrusion when examining 

drill core. 

9.2.2 Renard 7 

The Renard 7 kimberlite is a moderate to large sized kimberlite in the Renard Cluster. It is interpreted as a 

diatreme-zone kimberlite with a slightly irregular shape at surface, and tapering gradually with depth. The 

geology of this kimberlite has been determined in a preliminary fashion using seven drill holes.  

The current 3D model of Renard 7 consists of two main pipe-infilling kimberlite units: a highly diluted grey-green 

MVK that is referred to as Kimb7a and is classified as TKB; and an extensive amount of HK localized in the 

upper southern portion of the body referred to as Kimb7c. However it is unclear at this time if this HK represents 

a main pipe infilling event. In the current 3D model, separate phases of kimberlite were not modelled, therefore 

their relative abundances are unknown. CCR almost completely surrounds the main kimberlite pipe infills along 

with a CRB block located in the southeast. This CRB is more internal than marginal to the Kimb7a unit. 

Additional, smaller but significant zones of CRB are also noted within the Kimb7a unit. A number of HK dykes 

and irregular intrusions occur throughout the body, along the pipe contacts, within the marginal breccia and in 

the cracked country rock. These are also referred to as Kimb7c because at this time they cannot be 

distinguished geologically from HK in the large intrusion.

Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 50 

9.2.3 Renard 8 

The Renard 8 kimberlite is one of the smallest kimberlite pipes within the Renard Cluster. It is interpreted, based 

on a limited number of drill holes, as a steep-sided diatreme-zone kimberlite with a regular external shape. The 

geology of this kimberlite has been determined in a preliminary fashion using 10 drill holes. 

The current 3D model of Renard 8 consists of one main pipe infill kimberlite unit: a highly diluted grey-green 

MVK that is classified as TKB, referred to as Kimb8a. In addition, CCR completely surrounds the main kimberlite 

pipe infills along with a CRB block located in the south. The CRB is more internal than marginal to the kimberlite. 

In addition, a number of HK dykes and intrusions referred to as Kimb8c occur throughout the body, along the 

pipe contacts, within the marginal breccia and in the cracked country rock. 

9.2.4 Renard 10 

The Renard 10 kimberlite is the smallest "pipe" within the Renard Cluster. It cannot technically be classified as a 

pipe per se, as its morphology is more dyke-like. However, the kimberlite (17% of the body by volume) in this 

body is surrounded by a significant marginal CRB (83% of the body by volume). This is a feature that has not 

been noted to be associated with other large dykes on the Foxtrot property. Only five diamond drill holes have 

been completed to date on Renard 10 and it is on this data that these preliminary interpretations are based.  

The kimberlite in Renard 10 is classified as HK and the morphology of this HK is dyke-like. Kimberlite represents 

17% of the modelled body by volume and is typically undiluted. Contacts between this HK and the adjacent CRB 

are sharp. The CRB has an overall appearance and texture similar to that of the other Renard bodies. This, and 

the presence of the extensive CRB associated with the relatively small amount of kimberlite suggests that 

Renard 10 may actually represent a blind intrusion. 

9.3 Foxtrot Kimberlite Dykes 

9.3.1 Lynx Kimberlite Dyke 

The Lynx dyke consists of CK that can be further classified as HK. Trenching and mapping of Lynx and the 

logging of 73 drill holes reveals that the dyke comprises semi-continuous thick intersections of kimberlite with 

many thin (from < 1 cm to 40 cm) discrete sheets adjacent to it. Lynx extends for a minimum of 4.2 km along 

strike and has a variable dip (10o to 50o) to the east. The dyke may reach cumulative thicknesses of up to 3 m, 

however the average thickness is 1.8 m. The main kimberlite intersection appears to pinch and swell and, where 

thin, is strongly altered and replaced by clays. Overall, Lynx displays varying levels of alteration, often showing 

zonation with portions of the main intersection being highly altered and friable on one half, but massive and 

relatively unaltered in the other. Fracturing is present throughout the dykes and varies in intensity (Figure 9.4).  

Macroscopically, the Lynx HK is dark grey to green coloured, strongly magnetic and consists of two generations 

of olivine (macrocrysts and phenocrysts) set in a carbonate rich groundmass. Olivine macrocrysts are  

medium- to coarse-grained with common, very coarse grains and are completely serpentinized. Olivine 

comprises 40% - 50% of the rock, however local variations range from 10% - 90%. Olivine megacrysts and 

olivine dominated mantle nodules larger than 10 cm are present. Mantle indicator minerals are very common 

throughout this HK, representing up to 3% of the rock by volume and include coarse- to very coarse-grained

picroilmenite, chrome diopside and pyrope garnet. Country rock xenoliths are rare, representing less than 2% of 

the rock. Xenoliths are rounded to sub-rounded and are strongly altered granitoid or gneiss fragments. Contacts 

with the surrounding country rock are marked in the kimberlite by local minor fracturing and sometimes extensive 

carbonate veining. Chilled margins with flow aligned olivine macrocrysts are common and typically less than  

5 mm in width. Fracturing parallel to the contact, and joints perpendicular to the contact, are present within the 

country rock and decrease in intensity away from the contact. The Lynx dyke typically cuts the foliation of the 

country rock. 

Microscopically, the Lynx HK consists of olivine macrocrysts and phenocrysts and evenly distributed, crystalline 

groundmass dominated by carbonate, serpentine and phlogopite with an average modal for carbonate of  

15% - 35%. Olivine are completely pseudomorphed to a pale-yellow green serpentine and more rarely 

carbonatized, and commonly show a preferred orientation with their long axes sub-parallel to the dyke margins. 

Groundmass minerals consist of carbonate, phlogopite, monticellite, serpentine and ilmenite with minor dolomite. 

Accessory minerals (5% modal) include perovskite, spinel and apatite. Distinctive magmatic textures are 

observed in Lynx, where calcite occurs as millimetre scale oikocrysts that enclose small olivine and other matrix 

minerals (Patterson et al., 2009).  

9.3.2 Hibou Kimberlite Dyke 

The Hibou dyke is a CK that can be further classified as an HK. Hibou consists of one main kimberlite 

intersection with thin HK veins and dykes (from 1 cm to 30 cm) adjacent to the main intersection. Trenching and 

mapping of Hibou and the logging of 35 drill holes reveals that the HK may reach up to 3.5 m thick, but is on 

average 2 m thick. The dyke has a west-northwest strike extent of at least 850 m with a shallow dip of 

approximately 10o to the north-northeast. It is open, down dip and along strike to the northwest. The HK pinches 

and swells and, where thin, is strongly altered to clays. Overall Hibou displays varying levels of alteration and/or 

weathering that is zoned. Fracturing is present throughout the dyke and varies in intensity (Figure 9.4).  

Macroscopically, Hibou HK is grey-green to green coloured and strongly magnetic. Olivine macrocrysts are 

medium- to coarse-grained with very common coarse grains set in a carbonate rich groundmass. Olivine 

macrocrysts comprise approximately 50% - 60% of the rock but can vary from 25% - 70% locally. Olivine size 

frequently continues beyond the size range of macrocryst classification with individual olivine grains measuring 

more than 3 cm in length. Olivine dominated mantle nodules are also present and reach up to 10 cm in size. 

Olivines are typically completely serpentinized. Mantle indicator minerals such as pyrope garnet, chrome 

diopside and picroilmenite are readily observable, representing up to 3% of the rock by volume. Local calcite 

segregations are observed and calcite veining is present through the dyke and can reach up to 2 mm in 

thickness. Country rock xenoliths are relatively rare, representing < 2% of the rock by volume. Xenoliths are 

strongly altered, are sub-rounded to rounded and consist of gneiss or granitoid fragments that measure up to 

7 cm in diameter. Contacts with the surrounding country rock are sharp and marked in the kimberlite by local 

minor fracturing and carbonate veining. Chilled margins with flow-aligned olivine macrocrysts are common and 

typically less than 5 mm in width. Fracturing parallel to the contacts, and joints perpendicular to the contacts, are 

present within the country rock. Hibou is cut by rare black hematite veins less than 5 mm thick that appear to 

follow the jointing in the dyke. Flow banding of groundmass minerals is evident and tends to be somewhat erratic 

in orientation. The dyke is variably weathered and in some areas alteration is intense.

Microscopically, Hibou HK consists of olivine macrocrysts and phenocrysts set within an evenly distributed, 

crystalline groundmass dominated by carbonate, serpentine and phlogopite with an average modal carbonate 

estimate of 15% - 35%. Olivine macrocrysts are fresh to completely pseudomorphed to a dark green to black 

serpentine and are rarely carbonatized. They commonly display a preferred orientation with their long axes  

sub-parallel to the dyke margins. Unlike Lynx, fresh olivine macrocrysts are more common in Hibou. 

Groundmass minerals consist of carbonate, phlogopite, monticellite, serpentine and ilmenite with minor dolomite. 

Accessory minerals (5% modal) include perovskite, spinel and apatite. Calcite oikocrysts (as in Lynx) and 

dolomite rhombs occur in fresh samples of Hibou (Patterson et al., 2009).

10.0 EXPLORATION 

All exploration has been carried out by Stornoway Diamond Corporation.

10.1 Geological Mapping 

Structural geological mapping was undertaken in the area of the Lynx dyke in 2004, and over the Renard bodies 

in 2006. The objective of the mapping program was to identify structural controls that could help locate more 

kimberlitic intrusions or dykes. The program results proved to be inconclusive. It was noted, however, that the 

rock fracturing intensity increased near the kimberlitic bodies. 

Each trench excavated on Renard 4, Lynx, Hibou, and the North Anomaly was mapped in detail prior to 

sampling. Mapping was undertaken with grid control and reference points were surveyed by a registered 

surveyor. Mapping notes were made on the contacts and included the mineralogy, relationship of the dyke to the 

host rock, and structural measurements in the host rocks. Plan and section maps were completed for the 

majority of the trenches. 

During the underground bulk sampling program at Renard 2 and Renard 3, geological mapping was completed 

on all workings. The face was mapped after each round during the development of the ramp and drifts and, after 

the underground excavation was completed, the ramp and drift walls were mapped in the kimberlites. 

10.2 Heavy Mineral Sampling 

Since the inception of the Foxtrot Project, approximately 12,000 heavy mineral samples have been collected 

over a 400,000 km2 area of which some 8,140 lie within the current land holdings. Prior to staking in 2000, 

thirteen of these heavy mineral samples were collected within the area that became the Foxtrot Property.  

Follow-up sampling during 2000 identified several areas with anomalous concentrations of kimberlite indicator 

minerals on the Foxtrot property. Additional heavy mineral samples were collected during 2002 to 2008 within 

the Foxtrot Property boundaries, to further refine existing mineral trains and to increase the sample density 

within the property. This work has been reported in previous technical reports (Clements and O'Connor, 2001, 

2002; Lucas et al., 2003; LÃ©pine and O'Connor, 2004; O'Connor and Lepine, 2005, 2006). 

Sample intervals within the Foxtrot Property vary between 25 m and 600 m along lines spaced between 50 m 

and 2,000 m. Heavy mineral samples collected to date are summarized by year in Table 10-1. The heavy 

mineral samples have defined a number of areas with anomalous concentrations of kimberlite indicator minerals 

on the Foxtrot Property. Some of these areas are still being investigated, and have the potential to host 

kimberlite pipes or dykes.

Since 2000, several ground and airborne geophysical surveys were completed on the Foxtrot Property. This 

work has been reported in previous technical reports (Clements and O'Connor, 2001, 2002; Lucas et al., 2003; 

Lepine and O'Connor, 2004; O'Connor and Lepine, 2005, 2006). Geophysical surveys that have been completed

10.4.1 Renard 4 

The Renard 4 kimberlite was discovered by drilling early in 2002. Two outcrops of kimberlite were located during 

the summer of 2004 at the northern end of the known body, and these were subsequently demonstrated to 

coincide with the Renard 4 Northern Complex Zone (NCZ). 

Small to moderate surface/outcrop samples were collected on three occasions:  summer 2004 (1.8 t), summer 

2005 (2.9 t), and summer 2005 (6.9 t). The initial 11.6 t of kimberlitic material were processed at the Stornoway 

(formerly Ashton) North Vancouver laboratory. Between June 29 and July 22, 2006, and again from September 

27 to October 2, 2006, approximately 2,345 t were collected from a surface trench in six subsamples using an 

excavator. 

The 2006 trench was developed over the smaller surface trench excavated in 2005 which, in turn, had been 

developed over the 2004 excavations. Material collected in 2006 was processed at the LagopÃ¨de DMS during 

2007. Results are summarized in Table 10-4. 

10.4.2 Renard 65 

During 2007, a large-tonnage batch of kimberlite was collected from a trench excavated at the northern margin 

of Renard 65 and processed at the LagopÃ¨de DMS plant.  Results are summarized in Table 10-4. 

10.4.3 Lynx Dyke 

The Lynx dyke was uncovered by backhoe at four separate locations during the 2005 summer program. The 

kimberlitic dykes at each site were mapped geologically, blasted and sampled. 

In June 2007, trenches T-221-01 and T-230-02 were expanded to allow the collection of a bulk sample 

processed at the LagopÃ¨de DMS plant. Results are summarized in Table 10-4. 

10.4.4 Hibou Dyke 

The Hibou dyke was sampled in 2005, 2006, and 2008.  The large tonnage sample from 2008  

(Trench T-271A-10) was processed at the LagopÃ¨de DMS plant.  Results are summarized in Table 10-4. 

10.4.5 North Anomaly Dyke 

The North Anomaly Dyke was sampled in 2006.  Results are summarized in Table 10-4. 

10.5 Drilling 

Drilling is discussed in Section 11 of this report.

10.6 Bulk Density 

Bulk density determinations are discussed in Section 12 of this report. 

10.7 RC Chip Sampling 

The RC chip sampling program on the Renard Project was undertaken with objectives that varied over time from 

simply collecting a large amount of kimberlite to create representative samples, to characterizing the grade over 

various depth intervals, to regular sampling intervals.  Early work on the project also considered that some 

minimum quantity of kimberlite should comprise each sample to accommodate processing.  The data set of 

sampling results represents: 

Sampling intervals from 10 m to more than 50 m; 

Combination of chips from adjacent holes over similar intervals in order to double the volume of kimberlite 

from that interval; 

In some areas, regular sampling at uniform downhole spacings; and 

Sampling governed by internal geological contacts, completed during the 2007 program. 

Results are summarized in Table 10-4. 

10.8 Core Sampling 

Drill core collected during historical drill programs was composited and treated for macrodiamond recovery. 

Results are summarized in Table 10-4.

10.9 Underground Bulk Sampling 

The underground exploration program at the Renard Project was designed to extract a minimum of 2,000 t of 

kimberlite from each of Renard 2 and Renard 3 at a depth of approximately 55 m below the present surface. 

Supplies and equipment were mobilized from Chibougamau via Buffalo aircraft to the ice airstrip at Camp 

LagopÃ¨de in March and April 2006. 

Preparatory work included establishing powder magazines, constructing office and dry facilities for the miners, 

erecting a maintenance shop and generator shed, constructing a mine water sump, installing a waterline, and 

assembling the equipment. Equipment consisted of a two-boom jumbo, one haul truck, two scoops, a scissorlift 

truck, and a crew transport vehicle. Genivar Inc. supervised all aspects of the operations, while mining contractor 

Monterie Expert Inc. was engaged to provide equipment and personnel to complete the work. 

The portal was located on the southwest side of a hill immediately north of Renard 2. An 8 m, near-vertical 

outcrop face was present at the location, reducing the need for an extensive portal trench. Following mobilization 

and assembly of the equipment, cleaning of the portal area commenced at the end of June to expose the 

bedrock. A small airtrack drill was used to bore the portal blast holes. The first blast occurred on July 16, 2006. 

Four blasts were required to obtain a suitable face for the portal. To provide additional ground support for the 

brow of the portal, chain link fencing and strapping were bolted to the rock. 

The first round in the ramp was taken on August 1, 2006, and work was completed on February 22, 2007. The 

ramp dimensions are 3.8 m by 4.2 m, with a maximum grade of 15%. The back was screened and bolted, 

generally using a 1.2 m by 1.2 m pattern with Swellex bolts or resin rebar and galvanized, welded wire mesh. A 

total of 749.1 m of underground workings was completed, comprising a portal, ramp, ore drifts, safety bays, 

sump pump stations, an electrical substation and a powder magazine. Excavations were completed to a depth of 

approximately 55 m below surface. The main ramp length totalled 435.6 m with lateral excavation in waste of

111 m (from base of ramp to Renard bodies) and lateral excavation in ore of 202 m. Horizontal drifts to access 

the Renard 2 and Renard 3 kimberlites were each about 100 m in length. Ground conditions within the cross-cut 

leading into Renard 2 were challenging, but ground conditions within the kimberlites were excellent. Production 

rates averaged 3.59 m per day; but varied depending upon whether single or double faces were being 

advanced. 

Underground, the faces were surveyed using a Leica total station instrument equipped with a reflectorless 

measuring device. Details of each side of the gallery and the front face were surveyed with a variable number of 

survey points depending on the regularity of the surface. Each survey was divided into five different surfaces: 

floor, back, left and right walls, and front face. These surveys were used to measure the rate of advance and to 

calculate the volume of material removed. 

Sampling consisted of collecting the kimberlite material blasted from each round. After each blast, material was 

mucked from the face with scoops and collected in a remuck bay. From the remuck bay, the ore was loaded into 

a haul truck and transported to the secure ore stockpile area located adjacent to the DMS facility on the surface, 

some 200 m southeast of the portal (Figure 10.1).  A typical round was three to five metres in length, or 

approximately 150 t.  A total of 60 individual samples were collected:  29 from Renard 2 

(5,010 calculated tonnes) and 31 from Renard 3 (5,161 calculated tonnes). A representative sub-sample from 

each of Renard 2 (15 round; 2,449 t) and Renard 3 (13 rounds; 2,114 t) were processed through the LagopÃ¨de 

DMS for macrodiamond recovery (Figure 10.2 and Table 10-4).  The remaining unprocessed rounds are in the 

secure storage area if future work is required. 

The underground workings were allowed to flood late in 2007.

2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010

Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 62 

10.10 Petrography, Mineralogy and Other Research Studies 

Since 2001, several petrographical and mineralogical studies have been undertaken on the Renard kimberlitic 

bodies and the Lynx, Hibou and North Anomaly dykes. These studies include: 

Detailed trench mapping; 

Detailed core logging in the Renard Core Area, and the Lynx and Hibou dykes; 

Petrographical thin section descriptions; 

Indicator mineral and geochemical studies on the various kimberlite phases at Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 

4 and Renard 9; 

Age dating HK dykes from the Renard 1 kimberlite, on the main phases at Renard 2 and Renard 3 and the 

Lynx dyke; and 

Characterization of geophysical signatures on a unit by unit basis. 

The macroscopic and petrographic studies were used to distinguish the different lithological units within the 

kimberlite pipes, and were essential for the construction of 3D geological models. 

10.11 Geotechnical and Hydrological Drilling 

No drilling specifically for geotechnical or hydrological purposes was undertaken in the exploration phase 

although standard geotechnical data was collected from drill core. Geotechnical and hydrological drilling 

completed as part of the bulk sampling program is discussed in Section 11. 

10.12 Further Exploration 

Several unexplained kimberlite indicator mineral trains and geophysical anomalies remain within the Foxtrot 

Property. To explore for additional kimberlite occurrences, the joint venture will collect additional heavy mineral 

samples, complete ground and airborne geophysical surveys, prospect areas of anomalous indicator mineral 

results and drill exploration targets generated from the heavy mineral sample, geophysical and prospecting work.

11.0 DRILLING 

All drilling has been carried out under the control of the issuer. A total of 618 drill holes (110,170 m) have been 

drilled on the Property since 2001, comprising 36 RC holes (6,151 m) and 582 core holes (104,019 m). In 

addition, eight holes (123 m) have been drilled specifically for geotechnical and hydrological purposes. Total 

surface drilling on a year-to-year basis for exploration work is summarized in Table 11-1. During 2007, and as 

part of the underground bulk sample work, 22 holes were drilled from underground on Renard 2 (1,508 m) and 

21 holes on Renard 3 (874 m). 

Vertical and angled holes were drilled through the kimberlite bodies, from which three dimensional geological 

models were constructed for resource estimation. Drilling intersections are therefore not related to true thickness 

of mineralization. 

Between 2001 and 2002, drilling was completed primarily for early-stage, exploration-focused programs for all 

the bodies except for Renard 9 and Renard 10, which were discovered in 2003 and 2005, respectively. From 

2003, drilling was used to support advanced-stage project evaluation, and deposit delineation by providing bulk 

and mini-bulk samples. Additional target exploration drilling has been ongoing since 2001 on the Foxtrot 

Property.

11.1 Drilling Methods 

11.1.1 Reverse Circulation Drilling 

Since 2004, Foundex Exploration of Surrey, BC, has been the drilling contractor for all reverse circulation (RC) 

work on the Renard Project, employing an HT-2000 drilling system rig. RC holes ranged from 88 m to 211 m 

depth and measured 27.7 cm to 28.8 cm diameter. All RC boreholes were drilled vertically. In 2004, Stornoway 

completed a 23-hole, large-diameter RC drilling program on the Foxtrot Property, for 4,157 m of drilling.  Another 

five and eight RC holes were drilled in 2006 and 2007, for a total of 805 m and 1,189 m, respectively. Due to the 

complex geology of the Renard bodies and the reduced geological information gathered by using RC drilling 

methods, all RC borehole locations were twinned with core holes that had previously been drilled into the Renard 

bodies. 

The winter 2004 RC drilling program was undertaken using a mix of water and air to bring the kimberlitic chips to 

the surface, whereas the summer 2004 program used a "reverse flood" technique. Reverse flood drilling uses 

much larger volumes of water, which is thought to reduce diamond breakage by flushing the cuttings away from 

the drill head in a timely manner, and facilitating a more rapid, less aggressive transport to surface. In the 2006 

and 2007 drill programs, the reverse flood technique was used for all RC drilling, with the exception of one hole 

on Renard 4, where the air and water method was required due to technical difficulties. 

A downhole calliper survey was performed when each RC hole was completed. The goal of the RC calliper 

survey was to measure the diameter of the hole for the calculation of volume (in cubic metres) of material drilled 

along the length of the RC hole for diamond grade estimation. 

The calliper system comprises a mechanical three-arm calliper with a winch and cable system. Each arm of the 

calliper can extend to a maximum distance of 0.2 m in length. The survey methodology consists of lowering the 

calliper to the bottom of the RC hole, extending the arms until they contact the RC hole wall, and then raising the 

instrument at a constant rate so that the calliper arms can measure the RC hole profile in real time. Each  

RC hole was surveyed twice so that the repeatability of the data is consistent and reliable. The information is 

recorded on a laptop computer and subsequently processed and interpreted. The data were presented as a 

graphic 3-D downhole log and a downhole Excel spreadsheet. 

RC drilling recovers kimberlite as a continuous stream of rock chips ranging in size from a few millimetres to 

several centimetres depending on the characteristics of the rock being drilled and the type of bit being used. 

Since a certain percentage of rock material is discarded as under-sized material, or lost in fractures in an  

RC borehole, the weight of the sample is calculated rather than measured directly. The weight equals the 

volume of the hole multiplied by the bulk density of the kimberlitic material. Volumes were determined 

mathematically as a function of hole diameter and sample length. Tonnages were determined on a  

sample-by-sample basis using the proportion of each geological unit and the measured density as determined 

from the same interval in the twinned core hole (refer to Section 12). 

Rock chips are collected at regular depth intervals, logged geologically, and archived for later use. Rock chip 

size, morphology, and granulometry are monitored constantly and recorded in drill logs. The RC data collected 

are used to compare with diamond recovery data and to determine the best bits for particular rock types. The 

Foundex drillers also recorded technical information during the drilling, including rotary pressure, bit pressure, 

revolutions per minute, air pressure and production rates.

The RC chip recovery is monitored on a sample-by-sample basis by estimating the theoretical tonnage (calliper 

volume times sample length times density) minus the approximate dry weight of the samples processed. RC 

recoveries typically vary from 51% - 78%. Recoveries are lower when the rock is strongly diluted by country rock 

xenoliths. Stornoway observed that certain RC bit types and drilling techniques did not give good recoveries. 

11.1.2 Core Drilling 

Chibougamau Diamond Drilling of Chibougamau, Quebec, has been the drill contractor for all core drilling (both 

surface and underground) on the Renard Project since 2001. 

The diesel-powered surface drill rigs used for the majority of the work are unitized HC150's (essentially 

equivalent to a Boyles 44), housed in metal shacks, skid-mounted and moved by bulldozer. Drill rods and 

ancillary equipment are transported by skid-mounted sloop (or sled). The rigs, as currently configured, are 

capable of drilling up to PQ diameter core (8.51 cm). Prior to the start of the 2009 summer drill program, the 

aluminum tower on one of the rigs was replaced with a stronger steel tower to allow deeper drilling. When 

required to test outlying exploration targets, the drill rig is configured for helicopter transport by removing it from 

the metal shack. Surface holes ranged from 12 m to 843.5 m in length, and were drilled at a variety of 

orientations with dips from -45Âº to -90Âº. 

The underground drill is a lightweight rig manufactured by Chibougamau Diamond Drilling and driven by air 

pressure. It is mounted on a steel frame and drills ATW core. The shortest underground hole was 7.5 m in 

length, and the longest 118 m in length. 

From 2001 to 2006, geologists provided by SOQUEM and Stornoway logged core using a method termed by 

Stornoway as "lithological" logging. During this period, all core logging was completed at the secure core shack 

at the LagopÃ¨de camp prior to being shipped to North Vancouver for diamond analysis.  In 2006, the logging 

style changed to a more detailed procedure termed by Stornoway as "petrological" logging. This method involves 

laying out one (or more) drill hole(s) in its (or their) entirety to allow the logger to compare geology between 

sections within an individual drill hole or across several drill holes more efficiently and effectively. In addition, 

with the petrological logging method, more emphasis is placed on petrographic, thin, section work to identify and 

correlate geological units. Beginning in 2006, all drill cores containing or suspected to contain kimberlite were 

logged using the lithological technique in camp and then shipped from the project site to Stornoway's North 

Vancouver facilities for petrological logging. In addition, core remaining from drill programs completed prior to 

2006 was re-logged using the petrological logging technique. In 2009, the core was logged using the petrological 

method in the field. To allow core holes to be laid out in their entirety, core logging was completed in a larger 

facility adjacent to the core shack. 

In addition to a traditional drill core log which noted rock type, mineralogy, colour, texture, structure, and 

alteration, an Excel modal analysis form was completed for holes drilled between the summer of 2003 and the 

end of 2008. Estimates of the country rock xenolith, kimberlitic matrix, olivine macrocryst, magmaclast, and 

autolith content, in percent, were noted for each 3 m core interval, and used to produce a visual representation 

of the estimated percent kimberlite content versus depth. Beginning in 2009, the percentage of country rock 

xenoliths within the kimberlite units was measured directly using a line scan method. Line scans are completed 

by measuring all country rock xenoliths greater than 0.5 cm along a line drawn on the core. The country rock

Project No. 09-1439-0001 66 

xenolith percentage is calculated by dividing the total of the country rock xenolith measurements by the length of 

the section measured, which is typically 1 m. 

Core boxes were labelled with aluminium Demo tape and stacked on wooden pallets. A portion of the core was 

labelled "waste" and stored at the camp. Between 2001 and 2008, kimberlitic material was palletized, strapped, 

numbered, and shipped to Chibougamau or Mirage by air. For the core designated for diamond testing, pallets 

were immediately loaded onto a locked van provided by Fastfreight of Montreal. Once full, the van was sealed 

and shipped directly to the North Vancouver laboratory. If no tests were required on the core, the pallets were 

shipped across the country using regular commercial transport carriers. Since 2009, only core required for 

petrographic or diamond analysis and telescoped holes are shipped to Stornoway's North Vancouver facility. 

Core recovery and other geotechnical parameters are collected for all drill cores on the project kimberlites. Core 

recovery in the area of the Renard Cluster, Lynx, Hibou and North Anomaly dykes is typically greater than 90%. 

Each box of core is photographed with a digital camera at the looped core shack. The photographs are then 

identified with the drill hole and core box numbers and stored on Stornoway's network in the North Vancouver 

office. 

11.1.3 Geotechnical and Hydrological Drilling 

To date, no geotechnical drilling has been undertaken in areas outside the Renard Core Area. However, while 

drilling for delineation or mini-bulk samples in the Core Area, detailed geotechnical observations are recorded. 

All holes are logged for geotechnical parameters such as total core recovery, rock quality designation (RQD), 

intact rock strength, weathering/alteration, joint condition rating, and fracture frequency classification, in order to 

obtain a rock mass number. A point load survey was completed on selected holes for Renard 2, Renard 3, 

Renard 4 and Renard 9. Beginning in 2009, several holes have been drilled to produce oriented core. Azimuth 

and inclination measurements for all fractures in the oriented drill core were recorded to aid in the development 

of a geotechnical model of Renard 2. 

Eight holes (122.7 m) were drilled for hydrological studies in the vicinity of Renard 2 and Renard 3 before the 

beginning of the underground operations (Barbeau, 2006). Seven of these drill holes were subsequently 

converted to water wells. The holes were advanced through the overburden down to the bedrock. Soil sampling 

and soil identification were performed every 1.5 m. Two to three permeability tests were carried out in each 

borehole. A pumping test was performed to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity of the ground. This drilling was 

done using a regular diamond drill with PQ diameter drill rods, allowing the construction of observation wells with 

either 50 mm PVC pipes and screen, or 38 mm PVC pipes, a sand filter, and a bentonite plug. 

11.1.4 Collar Surveys and Down Hole Surveys 

All positional work on the Property is carried out using a transformed UTM 18 NAD 27 local coordinate system 

(Canada Mean). 

Exploratory drill holes prior to 2004 were located relative to marked grids constructed using either Global 

Positioning System (GPS) units or chain and compass. In addition to using the marked grid, all exploratory 

borehole locations are verified by hand-held GPS units with no differential correction. Exploration drill hole

azimuths and inclinations are set using a compass and protractor, respectively. Final exploration borehole 

inclinations are surveyed using an "acid test" system.  

To position delineation and mini-bulk hole collar location pickets and front sights for holes drilled within the 

Renard Cluster, a registered surveyor uses GPS equipment with sub-centimetre accuracy. Technicians use a 

theodolite to align the drill rig with the collar picket and front sight pickets to ensure the holes are started 

accurately. After the drill programs are completed, the surveyor returns to locate the drill collar positions 

accurately by surveying the casings for locations and orientations. During 2003 and 2004, Corriveau J.L. and 

Associates Inc. of Val d'Or, Quebec, surveyed all the delineation and mini-bulk (as well as several of the 

exploratory) borehole collars using a Leica System 500 RTK real-time, differentially corrected GPS system 

(DGPS) with Â± one centimetre accuracy. In addition, cut-and-chained stations on the ground grids covering 

Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4, Renard 65 and Renard 8 were accurately located using the same survey 

equipment, and a series of control points were established on the Property. 

From the winter of 2005 until present, Paul Roy Surveyor of Chibougamau, Quebec confirmed locations of all 

survey collars.  The downhole track of core holes drilled at Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4, Renard 65, Renard 7, 

Renard 8, Renard 9, and Renard 10 and several exploratory holes drilled outside the Renard Cluster, were 

surveyed using the FlexIt borehole survey instrument to determine the azimuths and inclinations more 

accurately.  The FlexIt instrument is an electronic downhole compass tool that measures several parameters, 

such as azimuth, dip, magnetic field, and dip of the magnetic field. Once the data are downloaded into a 

computer, a program corrects for magnetic declination and rejects readings above the average magnetic field 

(56,000 nanoTeslas) for the area of the Renard bodies. The readings above average generally correspond to 

areas of magnetic rock.  In addition to the FlexIt system, a gyroscope system from Gyrosmart was used for the 

summer 2007 drilling campaign. This particular survey tool (IBG10), known as Imego's digital Butterfly 

Gyroscope, uses a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) gyro sensor and allows the downhole orientation 

survey to be carried out inside the drill string. For the drill program completed during 2009, in addition to using 

the FlexIt tool, a DeviFlex system from Devico A.S. was used to determine borehole geometry. The DeviFlex is a 

non-magnetic, electronic, multishot tool that uses accelerometers and strain gauges to calculate changes in 

inclination and azimuth. It is not affected by magnetic fields and is used for surveying inside casings and drill 

strings. 

All the core holes drilled on the Property are surveyed for magnetic susceptibility. From 2001 to 2006, an 

Exploranium KT-9 hand held instrument was used to manually measure the core at select intervals. Since 2006, 

magnetic susceptibility readings have been taken using a continuous reading, multi-parameter probe (MPP) from 

Instrumentation GDD. 

11.2 Drill Programs 

Between 2001 and 2002, drilling in the Renard Core Area was undertaken primarily as early-stage,  

exploration-focused programs. From 2003, most of the drilling was used to support delineation work and 

advanced-stage project evaluation through the collection of mini-bulk and bulk samples for all bodies except 

Renard 9 and Renard 10, which were discovered in 2003. Additional target exploration drilling has been ongoing 

since 2001 on the larger Foxtrot Property. These drilling programs have been discussed in detail in earlier 

technical reports (Clements and O'Connor, 2001, 2002; Lucas et al., 2003; LÃ©pine and O'Connor, 2004; 



2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE

O'Connor and LÃ©pine, 2005, 2006). Location plans for the drilling that is not used to support mineral resource 

estimation can be found in these reports. 

Table 11-1 summarizes the drilling on the Foxtrot Property. Drill hole collar locations and outlines of the 

kimberlite bodies contributing to the Mineral Resource Estimate discussed in Section 17 are shown in 

Figures 11.1 to 11.3. Details of the 2001 through 2008 programs can be found in the 2008 NI 43-101 Technical 

Report (Lecuyer et al, 2008). 

11.2.1 2009 Drilling 

Two drill campaigns were undertaken in 2009. The winter 2009 program, completed between February 16 and 

March 31, focused on further delineating the geology of Renard 2 and Renard 3 between the 400 m and 570 m 

levels. Five NQ and HQ diameter holes were completed at Renard 2 for 2,694 m and three NQ and HQ holes 

were drilled at Renard 3 for 1,094 m. The drilling confirmed a significantly expanded zone of kimberlite on the 

northern and eastern sides of Renard 2 at depths greater than 250 m below surface. Drill hole R2-57 ended in 

kimberlite at 729 m due to drilling difficulties, and did not determine the actual eastern contact of the pipe at 

depth. Winter drilling at Renard 3 modestly extended the dimensions of the kimberlite pipe at depth. 

The purpose of the summer drill program was to convert kimberlite zones discovered on adjacent sides of 

Renard 2 during the winter 2009 drill program in an attempt to increase the confidence to the Indicated Mineral 

Resource category. During the summer drill program completed between June 11 and September 29, 2009,  

24 holes were cored at Renard 2 (including three that extended existing older holes) and 12,718 m of new core 

was collected. Five of the 24 holes were terminated early due to excess deviation that would have prevented 

critical deep pierce points from being obtained, and one hole was lost at depth due to technical difficulties. Drill 

hole R2-73 was collared such that it passed through the southern portion of Renard 3 en-route to the deeper 

portion of Renard 2.

2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 72 

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

12.1 Heavy Mineral Sampling 

Heavy mineral sampling of surficial sediments was undertaken as part of the initial exploration programs. 

Sampling is discussed in detail in earlier technical reports (Clements and O'Connor, 2001, 2002; Lucas et al., 

2003; LÃ©pine and O'Connor, 2004; O'Connor and LÃ©pine 2005, 2006), and is not included in this report. 

12.2 Caustic Fusion Sampling 

The caustic fusion process is used to evaluate, characterize and correlate the diamond potential of individual 

kimberlite lithologies, and to provide data to facilitate the grade estimation process. The objective of this type of 

test is to extract all diamonds greater than 0.1 mm in size, through chemical dissolution of the host rock sample. 

Individual samples may vary in size from a few kilograms to hundreds of kilograms, depending on the available 

material and the specific purpose of the testing. Kimberlite may be collected from drill core, float boulders, 

subcrop, outcrop, underground exposures and subsamples of material in a process facility or a combination 

thereof. Individual sample results from comparable kimberlite units may be merged together to provide larger, 

statistically more representative, samples.  

Kimberlite is collected, described and recorded by the site geologists following protocols in place at the time. 

Samples are individually numbered, weighted, sealed in a tamper-resistant container appropriate for the volume 

of material, and transported to the test facility by a combination of charter aircraft and commercial couriers. 

12.3 Mini-Bulk Sampling 

Although there is no formal industry-accepted definition of a 'mini-bulk' sample, many companies would agree 

that the term is generally used to refer to the processing of kimberlite material up to several tens of tonnes. This 

material may be derived from drill core, RC chips, boulders, subcrop, outcrop, trenches or underground

workings. Mini-bulk samples are usually processed through Dense Media Separation (DMS) equipment that, 

depending on specifications and diamond recovery objectives of a particular program, may be configured to 

recover diamonds of greater than 0.5 mm, 0.85 mm or 1.18 mm on square-mesh screens. In some cases caustic 

dissolution or other extraction techniques may be utilized to recover the diamonds. All of Stornoway's mini-bulk 

samples reported herein were processed through DMS equipment, and the reported diamond content is based 

upon stones retained on either 1.18 mm square-mesh screens or +1 DTC screens. 

Stornoway's mini-bulk sampling programs reported herein have used drill core, RC chips, boulders, and surface 

trenches to source kimberlite material. Drill core was collected, described and recorded by the site geologists 

following protocols in place at the time. Core boxes were sealed, weighted and secured to pallets for shipping, 

then forwarded to the North Vancouver laboratory facilities. Upon receipt samples were verified, then composited 

and processed through an onsite DMS plant.  The mini-bulk sample data has not been used for mineral resource 

estimating. 

During the various RC drill programs, screen openings of either 0.98 mm or 1.18 mm were used to dewater the 

RC kimberlite chip recovery flow and to remove the undersize fraction. Recovered kimberlite was separated at

regular downhole intervals into individual samples and collected in either large 1.5 t bulk sample bags or 

individually lined 205 l steel drums. Bulk bags and/or drums were clearly identified with a unique numbering 

system, fastened with tamper-proof seals and transported to secured Stornoway storage facilities. Charter 

aircraft and bonded freight services were organized as required to transport sample materials to the process 

facility. In 2004, RC mini-bulk samples were dispatched to the external Thunder Bay Mineral Processing 

Laboratory (TBMPL) in Ontario for DMS processing, whereas RC mini-bulk samples from 2006 were sent to 

Stornoway's North Vancouver laboratory and those from 2007 were processed by the LagopÃ¨de-based DMS. 

Kimberlite mini-bulk samples comprised of boulders or trench material were processed through either the North 

Vancouver or LagopÃ¨de DMS plants. Results are summarized in Table 10-4. 

12.4 Bulk Sampling 

Although there is no formal industry-accepted definition of a 'bulk' sample, many companies would agree that the 

term is generally used to refer to the processing of kimberlite material exceeding several tens of tonnes. This 

material may be derived from drill core, RC chips, boulders, subcrop, outcrop, trenches or underground

workings. Bulk samples are usually processed through DMS equipment that, depending on specifications and 

diamond recovery objectives of a particular program, may be configured to recover diamonds of greater than 

0.85 mm or 1.18 mm on square-mesh screens. In some cases larger screen sizes or other extraction techniques 

may be utilized for diamond recovery. All of Stornoway's bulk samples reported herein comprise either surface 

trench or underground sample material, and were processed through DMS equipment. The reported diamond 

content is based upon stones retained on either 1.18 mm square mesh or +1 DTC screens.  

To maintain the integrity of the bulk samples, a sampling protocol was established before the exploration work 

took place in order to ensure that the final diamond recovery data can be linked to the correct kimberlite, sample 

location within the body and rock type. Each surface or underground round was assigned a sample number and 

a colour code by the mine geologist. For surface samples, individual loads were directed to specific dump piles 

in a secure, access-controlled, storage area located near the DMS facility. The storage area was monitored 

24 hours per day by an independent security force (Canaprobe, Montreal) and by CCTV surveillance.  

For underground samples, a sample number placard was posted in the remuck bay and on the dump truck so 

the underground operators and DMS staff were constantly aware of which sample was being handled. On 

surface, a member of the DMS staff at the controlled access storage site directed the loads to the correct 

stockpile locations and kept a log of loads that were delivered from underground. Once all loads were hauled to 

surface, the mine geologist checked that the remuck bay was cleaned out in preparation for the next sample. 

Sample number placards were taken to the surface with the final dump truck load and placed on the appropriate 

stockpile. A location plan of the surface or underground samples was updated each time a new pile was initiated, 

in order to easily identify sample location. 

Results of the bulk sampling programs are presented in Table 10-4.

12.5 Bulk Density Determinations 

The dry bulk density database for the Foxtrot Property comprises 1,082 bulk density records, consisting of  

652 measurements from drill core and 430 from bulk sampling. When multiple measurements from the same 

sample, and multiple subsamples from the same rock are averaged, and the laboratory Quality Control (QC) 

checks removed, there are 725 spatially discrete density samples. 

Morris Magnetics Inc. performed the first density tests in 2004 on Renard 2, Renard 3 and Renard 4 using the 

water displacement method. Between 2004 and 2009, additional bulk density samples were measured by Morris 

Magnetic Inc. and SGS Canada Inc., primarily through the immersion/water displacement method, as follows: 

Dry the sample in the oven at 49ÂºC overnight. 

Weigh each sample in air. 

Weigh each sample suspended in water. 

Calculate the displaced volume of the dry rock in water. 

The difference between the dry rock weight and the water displaced gives the calculated bulk density. 

Quality control checks comprising duplicate measurements with water and wax immersion techniques,  

repeat density determinations, blind checks between laboratories, and multiple subsamples of the same  

rock demonstrate small density variances on a sample-by-sample, measurement-by-measurement and  

process-by-process basis, but there does not appear to be a consistent shift from laboratory to laboratory. 

Variability is generally in the order of 0.00 g/cm3 to 0.05 g/cm3 (or from 0% - 2% assuming an average bulk 

density of 2.60 g/cm3), and should not be a concern for data interpretation. Density variations did not show a 

correlation with country rock dilution, nor was there a clearly demonstrable change of density with increasing 

depth in the kimberlite pipes.  

Country rock (CR) consists of predominantly gneissic, lesser granitic and minor pegmatitic phases. The 

relationship between granitic and gneissic units is commonly cyclic, such that large intersections of drill core are 

best described as mixed granite-gneiss. Given the proportion of mixed country rock units, and the overlapping 

density ranges for granite and gneiss, a calculated average bulk density of 2.72 g/cm3 has been applied to the 

country rock of all bodies.  

Bulk density ranges for both the fractured country rock (CRB) and fractured country rock with minor kimberlite as 

thin matrix/vein fillings (CRB+K) are a little lower than the country rock units, likely as a function of fracturing and 

alteration associated with brecciation, with overlapping ranges. An average bulk density of 2.61 g/cm3 for both 

CRB and CRB+K units has been applied. 

Table 17-7 shows the average bulk density values for the various geological units within the Renard kimberlites.

12.6 Moisture Content 

Determining the moisture content of each sample prior to processing through caustic fusion, DMS or bulk density 

is necessary to allow an accurate dry weight of the kimberlite to be calculated. The drying of bulk density 

samples is part of the standard routine used to measure density, as documented above.  

Samples of drill core processed through the Stornoway North Vancouver laboratory as part of the historical  

mini-bulk programs were stored inside for extended periods of time prior to DMS processing (23 days to 598 

days; average 141 days). As a result, the core had already dried out and no moisture content tests were 

performed. 

Moisture content tests were performed on the RC chip samples to allow an estimate of percentage chip recovery 

during drilling. These moisture contents were not used in the determination of RC mini-bulk sample masses, or 

during RC diamond grade calculations, as tonnages were based upon theoretical sample volumes of each 

contributing geological unit and the appropriate density. 

During bulk sampling programs, moisture content tests were completed on kimberlite from both the surface and 

underground samples. As each individual sample was being run through the DMS plant, between five and  

15 aliquots of raw feed (one to two kilograms each) were taken from the feed conveyor. Each aliquot was 

weighed, then dried in the oven at 105ÂºC for two hours and reweighed. Results for each aliquot were recorded 

and averaged to represent the assumed moisture content for the complete subsample. Average moisture values 

of 5.8% (range 3.0% - 8.5%) and 7.8% (range 3.9% - 15.4%) were obtained for the underground samples at 

Renard 2 and Renard 3, respectively. The large tonnage surface samples varied from an average of 7.1% 

(range 6.5% - 7.7%) at Lynx to an average of 10.8% (range 5.4% - 21.1%) at Renard 4. Renard 65 was 8.3% 

(range of 4.8% - 11.9%) and the Hibou sample was 9.8% (treated as one large sample).

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

13.1 Laboratories 

Three Dense Media Separation (DMS) process facilities have been used as primary macrodiamond extraction 

laboratories during the Renard exploration programs to date: an external unrelated 10 tph commercial facility at 

Thunder Bay, Ontario (owned and operated by Kennecott Canada Exploration Inc. and doing business as the 

Thunder Bay Mineral Processing Laboratory "TBMPL"); an internal 5 tph facility situated in North Vancouver, 

British Columbia (owned and operated by Stornoway); and, an internal 10 tph facility situated at Camp 

LagopÃ¨de, Quebec (owned by Stornoway and SOQUEM, and operated by Stornoway on behalf of the joint 

venture). The TBMPL is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada to the ISO/IEC 17025 standard as a 

testing laboratory for specific tests. Neither of the internal DMS facilities are accredited, but have been 

independently audited and are subjected to ongoing QA/QC testing. One non-accredited laboratory (Microlithics 

Laboratories Inc., Thunder Bay, ON) was used as a secondary facility for auditing tailings from mini-bulk and 

bulk samples. Kimberlite concentrate generated by the TBMPL and LagopÃ¨de DMS facilities was shipped to the 

North Vancouver laboratory for final treatment and recovery of diamonds. 

During the Renard exploration programs, microdiamonds were recovered by one internal facility situated in North 

Vancouver, British Columbia (owned and operated by Stornoway) and four external unrelated commercial 

facilities: Microlithics Laboratories Inc. located in Thunder Bay, ON; Saskatchewan Research Council 

Geoanalytical Laboratories (SRC), Saskatoon, SK; TBMPL (owned and operated by Kennecott Canada 

Exploration Inc.), Thunder Bay; ON; and, SGS Lakefield Research Ltd. (Lakefield) in Lakefield, ON. Neither 

Stornoway's internal facility nor Microlithics Laboratories are accredited, but have been independently audited 

and are subjected to ongoing QA/QC testing. Both Lakefield and SRC are accredited by the Standards Council 

of Canada under ISO/IEC 17025 "General Requirements for the Accreditation of Calibration and Testing 

Laboratories (CAN-P-4D)". The TBMPL is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada to the ISO/IEC 17025 

standard as a testing laboratory for specific tests. Microlithics, SRC and SGS Lakefield were further utilized as 

secondary laboratories to cross-check and verify recoveries from other microdiamond facilities. 

13.2 Dense Media Separation (DMS) Facilities 

Dense media separation is a standard industry process for the liberation and extraction of macrodiamonds from 

large volumes of sample material (commonly tens to thousands of tonnes). Rock samples are progressively 

crushed and the disaggregated material passed over a series of size sorting screens before being mixed with a 

slurry of ferrosilicon and water. A cyclone is used to split the heavy minerals, including diamonds, from the lighter 

waste rock. The heavy mineral concentrate is removed from the DMS plant and stored under secure conditions 

until the diamonds can be extracted. Waste material is recycled through the plant and recrushed to liberate finer 

and finer diamonds. The minimum and maximum diamond size that can be recovered by the process is 

determined by the plant configuration. For the Renard Project, all DMS plants targeted stones of +1 DTC screen 

size (essentially equivalent to a +1.18 mm square-mesh screen size).  

The non-accredited, internal Stornoway laboratory in North Vancouver provides mineralogical and geochemical 

analyses for diamond exploration in support of Stornoway's exploration projects. The laboratory includes a fully 

integrated heavy mineral processing and observing facility designed to recover and identify kimberlite indicator 

minerals from till samples, a caustic fusion dissolution circuit for diamond recovery from small kimberlite rock

samples, and a 5 tph Bateman/Van Eck & Lurie DMS facility for the recovery of commercial-sized diamonds from 

core, mini-bulk and bulk samples. The diamond recovery circuit includes a sizing circuit, an X-ray flow-sorting 

machine and grease table equipment. 

A 10 tph Bond Equipment DMS facility was mobilized, assembled and commissioned on site at Camp LagopÃ¨de 

in Quebec during 2006 and 2007. This internal facility was used in 2007 and 2008 to process material from  

mini-bulk and bulk sampling programs.  

Kennecott's TBMPL owns and operates a 10 tph Bateman/Van Eck & Lurie DMS facility, initially constructed in 

1993 and rebuilt during 2003. This facility was used during 2004 to process RC chip samples collected from the 

Renard Project. 

13.3 Caustic Fusion Sampling 

The caustic fusion technique, also known as caustic dissolution, utilizes chemical processing to provide total 

liberation of all diamonds within a given sample in order that an accurate diamond distribution can be 

determined. Caustic dissolution processes are usually applied to recover microdiamonds from relatively small 

volume samples (tens to hundreds of kilograms). Rock samples are loaded into large steel pots and caustic soda 

is added to dissolve the mineral matrix hosting the diamonds. Dissolution takes place over an extended period of 

time in temperature-controlled kilns. Once the reaction is complete, the residue is cooled and poured through 

stainless steel wire mesh screens at the required size to avoid loss of small diamonds. Depending on the size of 

the residue, further standard dissolution may be required. In cases where abundant oxides remain in the residue, 

a variety of other chemicals may be used to reduce the size of the concentrate, without harming the diamonds. 

Residues are then observed under microscopes by trained personnel, and the diamonds recovered, counted and 

weighted.  

To assure the integrity of the process, a chain of custody is established between the customer and the 

laboratory. Customer samples are processed in a controlled environment to ensure that confidentiality is 

maintained at all times. All samples are handled with due diligence during processing stages, according to 

previously defined protocols. Quality control grains are added to each aliquot undergoing the caustic dissolution 

process to monitor recovery. Similar caustic dissolution processes are used by all four external unrelated 

commercial facilities. 

Historically, Stornoway's internal laboratory facility applied a process of attrition milling, followed by heavy 

mineral separation and caustic fusion dissolution, as the initial method of testing kimberlite discoveries for 

microdiamonds. Initial processing was a complex process of controlled and iterative crushing followed by 

fractionation, magnetic separation techniques and heavy liquid separation to produce diamond-enriched 

concentrates. Caustic reagents are mixed with a portion of the concentrate and melted by heating in a muffle 

furnace at high temperature. Diamonds are then recovered from the resulting fusion residue.

13.4 Database 

Data collected from the various exploration, mini-bulk, and sampling programs were collated into a SQL Server 

relational database. Data requests are processed through the database administrator. Access to the data in SQL 

Server is restricted to the database administrator only. 

The database is stored on the server in the North Vancouver office, with backups being performed every day. 

One copy of the database is removed from site on a regular basis. Processing and diamond results hard copy 

data are stored in fire resistant filing cabinets in the North Vancouver office as are hard copy data of the Renard 

core field logging. In addition, these hardcopies have been scanned as digital PDF files which are stored on the 

server. 

13.5 Sample Security 

All sample processing is undertaken by qualified operators who conduct their work in secure laboratory areas 

with restricted access and following strict sample handling protocols. Diamonds recovered from the caustic 

dissolution process have limited commercial value and the focus is to extract and retain all available stones. 

Security, while present, does not form as large a component of process as it does for the DMS work which can 

recover hundreds of carats of diamonds, many of which may be potentially attractive for theft. 

DMS operations, post-processing treatment of DMS concentrates, observing, and post-observation handling of 

concentrates and diamonds, from 2004 to the effective date of this report, were conducted under approved 

security protocols and procedures, which include but are not limited to: 

Chain of Custody documentation 

Dual locking containers 

Uniquely numbered, single use, tamper resistant seals 

Monitoring and control of sample weights 

Limited access or dual access to certain laboratory premises 

Closed-circuit TV surveillance 

External security guards 

Comparative analysis of diamond size distribution is checked against historical and external laboratory results. 

13.6 Drill Core 

In the case of drill core collected for microdiamond analyses (i.e. caustic dissolution) during the 2009 drill 

program, once sample intervals had been established in the field, core was extracted from the core boxes and 

packed into 20 l, white, plastic pails lined with heavy polyethylene sample bags. Bar coded sample tags with

Project No. 09-1439-0001 79 

unique identification numbers were inserted into each sample bag and the bags sealed. Pails were clearly 

labeled inside and out with the same sample number, and then sealed with tamper resistant single use lids. 

Individual pail weights were recorded and this information forwarded to the company's expeditor in 

Chibougamau and the office in North Vancouver. The expeditor was notified once the pails left camp on a 

charter aircraft, met the aircraft at the landing site and transferred the sample pails to a secure location. The 

pails were then consigned to a commercial courier service for delivery to either the contract caustic fusion 

laboratory or to North Vancouver. Upon receipt of the samples the caustic fusion facility would take possession 

of the samples, document the number and weight of the pails and notify both the camp and the North Vancouver 

office. In certain cases diamond spikes were added to the core samples to assist in the sample tracking and 

QA/QC verification procedures.   

Historically, during drilling operations for mini-bulk sampling, specific security measures were instituted to 

minimize the potential for tampering and to maintain the integrity of the drill core from initial coring on site to 

delivery of the core to the North Vancouver laboratory. 

Once a full core tray has been reviewed by a joint venture geologist at the drill rig, the core boxes are sealed for 

transport by helicopter or ground transport to the core logging facility located at the LagopÃ¨de base camp, 

approximately 500 m west of the Renard kimberlite cluster. The core boxes are opened in the core library for 

detailed inspection, photographing and logging. The core library is a secure, locked facility without windows. 

Only authorized personnel are allowed inside. 

Once logging is complete, core boxes are resealed and sent by various types of charter aircraft to LG4 or 

Chibougamau where a quality control officer, employed by the joint venture, receives them. Core boxes are 

transferred by forklift truck from the aircraft to a semi-truck trailer and organized on palettes for delivery to 

Vancouver. The boxes are metal-strapped in a minimum of two locations to avoid movement during transport. 

Locks with hardened steel shackles secure the semi-trailer when the quality control officer is not present. The 

on-site quality control officer, the project manager located at the remote base camp, and the North Vancouver 

laboratory manager possess keys for the trailer locks. Once the semi-trailer is fully loaded, it is locked a final 

time and numbered security seals are placed on the lock hasp. The trailer is then dispatched to North 

Vancouver, where it is received by the laboratory manager. All the information such as seal number, trailer and 

container numbers, and date of departure is transmitted to the Vancouver office. Once the shipment arrives in 

Vancouver, the seal is verified and the van is off-loaded by a technician who verifies the contents against the 

chain of custody. 

13.7 RC Chips 

RC sample drilling operations occur under strict security measures to minimize potential tampering and to 

maintain the integrity of the samples while being shipped from the drill site to the North Vancouver or commercial 

laboratory. A fenced area with controlled access at the LagopÃ¨de camp and/or the LG4 site, was used for 

temporary storage of RC chip samples during the summer 2004 and 2006 drilling programs, prior to shipping the 

samples south. For the winter and fall 2007 RC drilling program, RC bags were stored in a restricted access 

area adjacent to the LagopÃ¨de DMS facility, before being processed on site.

Joint venture geologists supervised the sample collection. During drilling, access to kimberlitic chips was limited 

to authorized joint venture staff and drillers. Once filled, 1.5 t sample bags or 205 l steel drums were sealed 

immediately with cable ties and a security seal was applied to deter opening the bags or the drums. The bags 

and the barrels were loaded on pallets and transported by forklift to the camp's restricted loading area until 

loaded into aircraft. 

During the 2004 and 2006 winter drilling program, large capacity aircraft were used to transport the material to 

Chibougamau or Mirage. Once at the destination, the bags were unloaded from the aircraft for storage at a 

secure location where only authorized personnel were permitted, before being shipped to the Thunder Bay DMS 

facility or the North Vancouver facilities. During the summer of 2004, float-equipped airplanes were used to carry 

secured 205 l barrels to Mirage, a tourist outfitter lodge near LG-4, before being shipped to the Thunder Bay 

DMS facility. Seal number, trailer and container numbers and date of departure were recorded on the chain of 

custody and were transmitted to the Vancouver office. Once the shipment was in Vancouver, the seal was 

verified and the van was off-loaded by a technician who verified the contents against the shipping papers and 

checked sample weights. 

13.8 Bulk Sampling 

13.8.1 Underground Bulk Samples 

Access to the underground workings was restricted to ensure safety of personnel, as well as security and 

integrity of the samples. Only personnel involved in the underground program had access to the kimberlite, such 

as geologists, surveyors, equipment operators and drillers. On surface, the sample storage areas, treatment 

compound and DMS facility were considered as restricted areas and subject to access control, camera 

surveillance and security monitoring. An independent Quebec-based security firm, Canaprobe, was mandated to 

implement site security protocols and provided bonded security officers. During bulk sample processing, only 

authorized personnel had access to the restricted areas. Security personnel escorted all approved visitors. All 

personnel involved in the operations at the DMS facility were subject to criminal record checks and random daily 

searches. Surveillance by the security force included use of overlapping and task specific CCTV coverage, as 

well as a continuous physical presence within the DMS plant. Locked dual custody provisions were in force in 

the vicinity of the DMS concentrate.  

The concentrate was discharged from the DMS into 205 l steel drums lined with a heavy polyethylene sample 

bag. Once sample processing was complete, or the drum was full, the sample bag was sealed with a numbered 

tamper-resistant security tag by both a processing representative and a security representative. Each drum was 

mechanically sealed, locked and secured with two additional numbered tags. Sealed concentrate drums were 

weighted, labelled and moved to a secure, access controlled, storage site under constant camera surveillance 

and chain of custody documentation. Once enough concentrate drums had been collected, they were removed 

from site on a charter aircraft and transported under chain of custody to Chibougamau or Mirage, where they 

were temporarily stored in locked containers or secure vans before being shipped to North Vancouver with a 

bonded trucking company. Concentrate was transported in a locked, sealed and documented tractor-trailer on a 

"non-stop, 24/7" continuous basis from Chibougamau or Mirage directly to North Vancouver. Concentrate 

reception in North Vancouver was under dual custody conditions and included monitoring by external security 

officers, drum/external security seal number verification, integrity inspections and weight control. Concentrate

drums were then placed in a locked, access-controlled storage cage under CCTV surveillance until they could be 

processed. Paper records of access/transfer points were also maintained. 

13.8.2 Renard 4, Lynx and Hibou Trench Bulk Samples 

To ensure the security and integrity of the large tonnage surface samples, and the sample process itself, access 

to the trenches and the DMS stockpiles was limited to personnel specifically involved in the sampling, such as 

geologists, field assistants and heavy equipment operators. A log of personnel accessing the sites was recorded 

daily. Detailed records of the sample collection were kept including times of various activities and any incidents 

such as spillages. In addition, records were kept of all sample transfers from the trenching site to the DMS 

stockpile. 

13.9 Final Diamond Treatment and Recovery 

Diamond bearing concentrates generated by DMS processing of underground bulk samples, large tonnage 

trench samples and RC chip samples from the Renard Project were all subjected to final processing at 

Stornoway's North Vancouver laboratory facilities. The diamond recovery circuit includes a sizing circuit, an  

X-ray flow-sorting machine and grease table equipment. 

All processing of concentrates was undertaken in secured, controlled access, CCTV monitored areas of the 

North Vancouver facilities. An independent, external and bonded security force (FBIG Investigations) monitored 

CCTV equipment, provided a physical presence at critical points of the diamond extraction process and recorded 

both routine activities and any abnormal incidents (sample spillage, etc.). These security personnel also checked 

sample seals, sample weights and provided key control services for dual-locked storage areas, concentrate 

canisters and restricted areas. Processing personnel were subject to random searches at various times.

The descriptions of the Stornoway QA/QC programs are taken from O'Connor and LÃ©pine (2005; 2006) and 

Lecuyer et al. (2008).  Golder did review the QA/QC procedures but did not independently verify the QA/QC 

procedures. 

14.1.1 Caustic Fusion and DMS Sampling 

QA/QC testing is conducted on 5% of all samples passing through the North Vancouver caustic fusion 

dissolution circuit and DMS circuit. Golder did review the QA/QC procedures but did not independently verify the 

QA/QC procedures for the caustic fusion and DMS samples.  

QA/QC programs conducted by Stornoway include: 

Blind spiking of samples in processing, using "known" natural and synthetic diamonds prior to processing 

with recovery determined at the observation stage; 

Blind spiking of samples in observing, using "known" diamonds prior to observation; 

Regular testing of all machines and equipment; 

Calibration and verification procedures;

Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 83 

Routine audits of non-observable fractions and reject materials; 

Use of internal standards reference materials which are calibrated to provide traceability and reproducibility; 

A record-keeping system of documentation, which retains in archives all original records and data, with all 

amendments clearly marked, initialled and dated for reference; 

Corrective actions which are implemented immediately when any aspect of laboratory analysis does not 

conform to procedural standards; 

The investigation and verification of any result which appears to be a potential statistical anomaly, to ensure 

laboratory results fit within the geological context; and 

Use of external laboratories for check samples. Up to 5% of all samples are routinely sent for external 

analysis. 

The caustic fusion and DMS diamond recovery facilities are governed by a series of detailed procedures that are 

appropriate to ensure the security and integrity of samples and the final results. All samples received in the 

laboratory are accompanied by a chain of custody document and with security seals that must be verified prior to 

processing any sample. Upon receipt, the samples are stored in a secure facility with restricted access. The 

diamond recovery circuits are in restricted areas and all samples, concentrates, diamonds and data are locked in 

safes, cabinets, drying ovens, or secure rooms when not being handled.  

14.2 Golder Verification  

Golder has visited the Project site and the North Vancouver offices in order to audit procedures at Stornoway.  

Independent samples were not collected and treated by Golder since this is not practical for diamond sampling.  

The audit process requires matching of raw data from field copies for the various data collection areas to final 

copies of data to be used in public reporting and resource estimation. 

Golder has further reviewed documentation of procedures and verified that activities in the field conform to 

Stornoway's published internal procedures for those activities. 

Golder is of the opinion that Stornoway's published and practiced procedures for collection of data in the field 

and transposition of these data into data 'products' to support resource evaluation work and initial costing 

exercises meet industry best practice guidelines. 

14.2.1 Special Considerations for Diamond Resource Determination 

Unlike commodities such as gold or base metals, diamonds do not have a standard value per unit weight that 

can be used to calculate value of a deposit. A one carat diamond can be worth anywhere from less than one 

dollar to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the shape, colour and quality. A parcel of diamonds must be 

individually examined to establish an average value. Diamond values also change with the mix of diamonds over 

time, however, as a whole, diamond values have tended to increase with time. As this can be a somewhat

subjective exercise, multiple valuations from different professional diamond valuers, or diamantaires, are 

necessary, and are usually averaged to give an estimate of the probable true price of the goods in question. 

Diamond price estimates can differ between valuers by as much as Â± 20%, especially on smaller parcels of 

diamonds. These differences are simply due to the fact that different diamantaires will perceive the value of a 

stone or parcel of stones differently. Their price guidelines will differ somewhat as well. 

In a valuation exercise, it is necessary to involve a number of diamantaires to obtain a range of valuations that 

can be averaged to get an accurate price estimate and to use these data to model an average price. Often, in 

early stage evaluations of diamond projects, diamond price modelling is undertaken. In price modelling, the small 

sample size is compensated for by estimation of what the diamond population in a larger sample would be. By 

doing this, the valuer attempts to predict the likelihood of finding larger stones and what their effect on the overall 

value of the parcel would be and, as such, estimate more closely what the run-of-mine (ROM) value would be. 

Modelling involves study of the diamond parcel on hand, including size distributions and valuations, to 

statistically estimate the upper and lower limits of a production parcel at certain confidence levels based upon 

the small parcel on hand. To accomplish this, Stornoway contracted WWW Diamond Consultants International 

(WWW) of London to obtain valuations and perform price modelling. WWW are recognized international leaders 

in this field.  

Small parcels of diamonds are difficult and time consuming to value, so individual sample goods are generally 

combined on the basis of geology or some other parameter. Valuation parcels are generally sieved into DTC 

sieve classes (+1, +3, +5, +7, +9, +11) and grainer and caratage categories.  A cumulative 7,496.97 carat 

diamond parcel acquired by bulk sampling underground, trench sampling and RC drilling completed by 

Stornoway between 2003 and 2007 was used for value modelling.

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

15.1 Diamond Properties 

There are no advanced stage diamond exploration properties in proximity to the Foxtrot Property. 

In 2004, Majescor Resources Inc. (Majescor) discovered two occurrences of diamond-bearing kimberlite float to 

the west of the Foxtrot Property claims. A sample of the float processed in 2004 indicated it was diamondiferous 

with a total of 32 diamonds greater than 0.075 mm recovered from 136 kg of kimberlite (Majescor Resources 

Inc., 2004). In 2005, Majescor drilled up-ice of the float and discovered the Remick dyke. Additional drilling 

delineated the dyke for a strike length of 900 m and the kimberlite dyke remains open to the northwest and down 

dip (Majescor Resources Inc., 2006).  

During 2006, Forest Gate Resources, Majescor's joint venture partner at the time, identified a new kimberlite 

boulder dispersal train located near the Remick dyke. A 54.15 kg coarse kimberlite float sample (U0341-110) 

collected from this train returned a total of 83 diamonds (Forest Gate Resources, 2006; Majescor Resources 

Inc., 2007). 

Other kimberlite discoveries in the region include: 

Lac Beaver kimberlite, located approximately 90 km south of the Renard kimberlites on claims held by 

Ditem Explorations Inc (O'Hara, 2004); 

H1, H2, H3 and H4 kimberlites on the Tichegami property held by Ditem Explorations Inc. located 

approximately 75 km south of the Renard bodies (Robertson, 2003); and 

Hotish 1, 2 and 3 kimberlite dykes, within the Hotish Property held by Dios Exploration Inc., located about 

100 km south of the Renard Kimberlites (Vaaldiam Resources Inc., 2006). 

15.2 Other Commodities 

A number of other commodities have been identified in the general region of the Renard kimberlites, primarily to 

the south (see Figure 5.1).  These include (Houle, 2006): 

Gold and copper mineralization in the Eastmain River greenstone belt (e.g., the Eastmain gold deposit, held 

by Eastmain Resources Inc. through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eastmain Mines Inc.); 

Porphyry copperâ€“molybdenum mineralization in the Opatica Subprovince (e.g., the Macleod Lake/Windy 1 

deposit, held by Western Troy Capital Resources Inc.); and 

Uranium in the Otish Basin (e.g., the AM-15 zone, held by Strateco Resources Inc.). 

Future work at the specific mineral occurrences listed above could have implications to the Renard Project in 

that they could lead to cost sharing through power line and/or road (winter/all-weather) development activities.

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The following section is based on information in the previous Technical Report (Lecuyer et al., 2008) and has not 

been verified by Golder. 

16.1 Introduction 

Dense media separation (DMS) is a standard industry process for the liberation and extraction of commercial 

sized macrodiamonds from large volumes of core, mini-bulk and bulk sample material. Rock samples are 

progressively crushed and the disaggregated material passed over a series of size-sorting screens before being 

mixed with a slurry of ferrosilicon and water. A cyclone is used to split the heavy minerals, including diamonds, 

from the lighter waste rock. The heavy mineral concentrate is removed from the DMS plant and the diamonds 

are extracted. Waste material is recycled through the plant and recrushed to liberate finer and finer diamonds. 

The minimum and maximum diamond size that can be recovered by the process is determined by the plant 

configuration. For the Renard Project, all DMS plants targeted stones of +1 DTC screen size (essentially 

equivalent to a +1.18 mm square-mesh screen size) or above, although smaller stones have been recovered. 

Three DMS process facilities have been used as primary macrodiamond extraction laboratories during the 

Renard exploration programs to date: an internal 10 tph facility situated at Camp LagopÃ¨de, Quebec (owned by 

Stornoway and SOQUEM, and operated by Stornoway on behalf of the joint venture); an external unrelated  

10 tph commercial facility at Thunder Bay, Ontario (owned and operated by Kennecott Canada Exploration Inc. 

and doing business as the Thunder Bay Mineral Processing Laboratory (TBMPL); and an internal 5 tph facility 

situated in North Vancouver, British Columbia (owned and operated by Stornoway). By far the largest proportion 

of DMS processing has been through the LagopÃ¨de plant, as shown by facility and sample type in Table 16-1. 

Table 16-2 shows the sample breakdown for the individual Renard kimberlite bodies comprising the current 

resource calculations.

The basic flow sheet used for each of the three mineral processing facilities is described in the following 

subsections, as well as an outline of the QA/QC procedures. Golder has visited Stornoway's processing facilities 

at Camp LagopÃ¨de and in North Vancouver, but not the independent DMS facility at Thunder Bay. 

16.2 DMS Processing - LagopÃ¨de 

A ten-tonne-per-hour Bond Equipment DMS facility was mobilized, assembled and commissioned on site at 

Camp LagopÃ¨de in Quebec during 2006 and 2007. Stornoway operated this facility in 2007 and 2008 to process 

material from mini-bulk and bulk sampling programs. Trained DMS process operators supervised each shift in a 

secure building. Sample processing followed procedures similar to those of the Thunder Bay and North 

Vancouver facilities, with some exceptions due to remote field operations, as noted below. 

After excavation, kimberlite samples were stockpiled outside the facility in a secure compound with restricted 

access. Individual samples were prepared through a primary jaw crusher, and -50.0 mm crushed product fed 

directly into the DMS facility where a scrubber trommel unit removes the +20.0 mm oversize. The +20.0 mm 

oversize material was reduced using a secondary cone crusher set at 10.0 mm. Coarse rejects were recrushed 

to -6.0 mm and re-circulated through the facility. The first seven subsamples of the 2007 bulk sample program 

used a 1.2 mm by 13.0 mm slotted screen. Subsequent samples employed a 1.0 mm by 12.0 mm slotted screen 

to increase the recovery of smaller diamonds. Contract security services were provided on site by an 

independent third party (Groupe Canaprobe of Montreal, Quebec). 

DMS concentrates generated by the LagopÃ¨de facility were sealed in drums and dispatched in a locked 

container under chain of custody protocols to Stornoway's internal laboratory in North Vancouver for final 

treatment and recovery of diamonds. The laboratory owns and operates integrated diamond recovery equipment 

including a sizing circuit, X-ray flow-sort machine and grease table. Upon arrival at the North Vancouver 

diamond recovery facility, concentrates are screened into four size fractions, passed through an X-ray sorter 

twice, and the tailings diverted to a grease table circuit to generate a final diamond concentrate.

Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 88 

Diamond-enriched concentrates are stored in sealed lock boxes within high security cages before being 

transferred to the observation laboratory for final diamond recovery and reporting.  

A team of trained mineral observers and mineralogists undertakes final diamond recovery using a combination of 

hand-sorting and binocular microscopy techniques. All diamonds recovered are routinely verified, described, 

weighed, photographed and recorded by trained mineralogists and checked by the Chief Mineralogist. Results 

are reported as diamonds retained on a +1 DTC sieve class, or as stones greater than 1.18 mm using Tyler 

square mesh sieve classes when required. All diamond recovery is carried out with dual custody handling 

provisions under video surveillance in restricted areas. An independent external security team monitors and 

records all operations, transfers and seal control. FGIB Investigations (Vancouver, BC) has provided these 

contract services since 2004. 

Neither the internal DMS facility nor the diamond recovery circuit are accredited, but both have been 

independently audited and are subjected to ongoing QA/QC testing.  

16.3 DMS Processing â€“ Thunder Bay Mineral Processing Laboratory 

Kennecott's TBMPL owns and operates a ten-tonne-per-hour Bateman/Van Eck & Lurie DMS facility, initially 

constructed in 1993 and rebuilt in Thunder Bay during 2002 and 2003. This facility was used on two occasions in 

2004 to process RC chip samples collected from the Renard Project. Operators from Stornoway's North 

Vancouver facility supervised contract DMS processing in Thunder Bay to verify the quality and continuity of 

work being performed. The TBMPL is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada to the ISO/IEC 17025 

standard as a testing laboratory for specific tests. 

RC chip samples were sent to the facility in sealed pails, drums, or bulk bags, each with an individual sample 

number and security seal. Security seals were verified as being intact upon arrival at the laboratory, recorded in 

a chain of custody document and isolated in a secure storage area with controlled access overseen by an 

external independent security service (Apex Security, Thunder Bay). The same security team also monitored 

DMS processing and maintained video surveillance in restricted areas.  

Since the kimberlite material was already broken into chips from the RC drilling process, it was directly fed to the 

DMS scrubber unit, to remove the +16.0 mm oversize fraction which was sent to a secondary rolls crusher set at 

8.0 mm. Kimberlite was processed through the facility then the tails screened at 6.0 mm. Tails greater than  

6.0 mm were recrushed in a roll crusher set at 3.8 mm and repassed through the plant. Finer tails were 

discarded. A 0.85 mm by 14.0 mm slotted product screen was used within the Thunder Bay DMS facility. 

DMS concentrates were dried, then screened into six size fractions before being sent to the North Vancouver 

laboratory in secure shipments for further processing by heavy liquid and magnetic separation techniques.  Final 

diamond recovery, classification and reporting were also carried out in North Vancouver under secure, 

independently monitored conditions (FGIB Investigations, Vancouver, BC).

16.4 DMS Processing â€“ North Vancouver Facility 

Stornoway's internal laboratory in North Vancouver provides mineralogical and geochemical analyses  

for diamond exploration in support of Stornoway's exploration programs. The laboratory includes a  

five-tonne-per-hour Bateman/Van Eck & Lurie DMS facility and a diamond recovery circuit. Kimberlite samples 

are received at the laboratory as small diameter drill core in sealed core boxes, reverse circulation drill chips in 

sealed pails, bags or drums, or as surface material from outcrop or boulders packed in drums or bulk bags. Each 

box, pail, bag or drum is given an individual sample number and sealed in the field prior to shipment. Bags and 

drums are identified with security seals that are verified as being intact upon arrival at the laboratory in a locked 

and sealed shipment. Once the chain of custody documents, sample numbers, and security seals have been 

checked and verified, the sample is isolated in a secure storage area with restricted access. 

Trained operators conduct DMS processing in a secure portion of the laboratory. Samples are initially reduced 

through a primary jaw crusher at a nominal gap of 20.0 mm to 25.0 mm. This material is then passed through a 

combination of jaw and roll crushing at a nominal gap of 10.0 mm to 14.0 mm. The crushed product is fed into 

the five-tonne-per-hour DMS facility where a scrubber trommel unit removes the +14.0 mm oversize for 

recrushing.  

After primary feeding and sizing, all sample material is processed through the cyclone. DMS floats are screened 

at 4.0 mm with the undersize going to tails, and the oversize to iterative recrushing and repassing at 4.0 mm and 

2.0 mm to minimize the potential for diamond breakage. On early samples, a 1.0 mm by 12.0 mm slotted screen 

was employed within the DMS facility. In 2006, this was changed to a 0.85 mm by 14.0 mm slotted screen to 

better recover small diamonds, ensure a bottom diamond cut-point of 1.18 mm using a Tyler square mesh 

screen, and produce a minimum stone size smaller than that generally retained on a +1 DTC screen. 

Resultant DMS concentrates are screened into four or six size fractions, passed through an X-ray sorter twice, 

and the final tailings diverted to a grease table circuit for final recovery. Heavy liquid and magnetic separation 

recovery methods were employed on samples prior to 2006. Diamond-enriched concentrates are stored in 

sealed lock boxes within high security cages before being transferred to the observation laboratory for final 

diamond recovery and reporting.  

Final diamond recovery, classification and reporting were also carried out in North Vancouver under secure, 

independently monitored conditions (FBIG Investigations, Vancouver, BC). 

Neither the internal DMS facility nor the diamond recovery circuit are accredited, but both have been 

independently audited and are subjected to ongoing QA/QC testing. 

16.5 QA/QC 

Quality control testing was routinely conducted on drill core, RC chip, surface and underground samples 

processed through the three DMS facilities. Tailings and various processing residues are also subject to audit. 

QA/QC measures include but are not limited to: 

Adherence to established/documented processing and handling protocols; 

Systematic density bead tracer testing prior to operating plant to ensure efficiency and diamond recovery;

Addition of luminescent density tracers prior to DMS to monitor processing and X-ray sorter efficiency. 

Recovery is measured after X-ray sorter recovery; 

Addition of identifiable natural diamond spikes prior to any DMS processing; recovery is measured at the

Addition of natural diamonds prior to observation to determine the efficiency of diamond sorting and for 

security control purposes; 

Audit of representative coarse DMS tailings from select kimberlite subsamples; 

Re-crush of DMS tailings and concentrate tailings to monitor processing efficiency, X-ray/grease recovery, 

and diamond liberation; 

Regular DMS feed size analysis; 

Testing of processing circuit clean-out residues; 

Audits of processing rejects using secondary laboratories and DMS facilities; 

Monitoring of diamond recovery statistics, including size frequency analyses; 

Independent third party audit processes (spiking, process review, etc.); and 

Review and audit of DMS and diamond data, operating procedures and QA/QC programs. 

16.6 Metallurgical Testing 

To date, metallurgical tests have been performed to obtain data in support of pre-feasibility level plant design. 

Lakefield performed seven scrubbing and high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) tests on five samples obtained 

from Renard 2 and Renard 3. These tests were designed to provide the quantity of -1.0 mm material generated 

by the scrubbing process and to help establish basic operating and design parameters of any proposed diamond 

process plant. Processing records collected during operation of the LagopÃ¨de DMS facility also provide relevant 

design data for any proposed plant design.

17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

17.1 Introduction 

An updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4, Renard 65 and Renard 9 

kimberlites and the Lynx and Hibou Dykes within the Renard core area (Figure 9.1) was disclosed in the 

December 8, 2009, Stornoway news release. This section documents the process by which the Mineral 

Resource Estimate was established.  

The December 2009 Renard Mineral Resource Estimate Update was prepared by an independent Qualified 

Person, David Farrow, P.Geo., of Golder. The Mineral Resource Estimate comprises the integration of kimberlite 

volumes, bulk density, petrology and diamond content data obtained from 81,894 m of diamond drilling, 6,151 m 

of reverse circulation (RC) drilling, 12.7 t of samples submitted for microdiamond analysis, 600.8 cts of diamonds 

(6,457 stones) recovered from RC drilling and 8,611.6 cts of diamonds (84,381 stones) recovered from surface 

trenching and underground bulk sampling.  

The methodology of the Mineral Resource Estimate has been reviewed by Kevin Palmer, P.Geo., of Golder.  

The diamond sampling database is summarized in Table 10-4 and comprises of data derived from RC chip 

samples, core samples, trench samples and underground bulk samples. Large tonnage (trench and 

underground) samples were used to establish diamond grade frequency curves and average stone size for each 

body. RC samples and trench samples in the case of Renard 4, Lynx and Hibou, were used to estimate the in 

situ grades of the bodies. 

17.2 Previous Work 

A previous Mineral Resource Estimate was produced by AMEC in 2008. The results were detailed in the 

previous Preliminary Assessment (Lecuyer et al, 2009) and are summarized in Table 17-1.

17.3 Geological Models 

Geological solid models were created by Stornoway for each of the Renard bodies included in this study: 

Renard 2; Renard 3; Renard 4; Renard 9; Renard 65; Lynx and Hibou. The solids were reviewed by Golder and 

accepted as suitable for mineral resource estimation purposes. The geological models are discussed in  

Section 9.

17.4 Sampling Analysis 

Diamond sampling of the Renard Project kimberlites includes, core sampling, RC chip sampling, small tonnage 

trench sampling, and bulk sampling from both surface trenches and the underground exploration workings. 

These data have been collected, compiled and analyzed by a combination of methodologies in order to cater to 

the spatial distribution of sampling and the amount of information available for each kimberlite domain in each 

body.

The evaluation process comprised the following steps: 

Analyse the macrodiamond populations to ensure they are robust for mineral resource valuation. 

Develop the relationship between macrodiamond and microdiamond populations. 

Establish that the microdiamond population is stable with depth. 

Diamond size frequency analysis to establish undiluted grades for different lithofacies by: 

using macrodiamonds and/or microdiamonds; and 

establishing individual population grades for mixed samples. 

Determine a factor to account for the presence of highly discontinuous, unmodellable units (Kimb2c and 

Kimb4c);

Establish distributions for the dilution in the various bodies and lithotypes; 

Bulk density analysis: 

establish bulk density per lithotype; and 

demonstrate that bulk density is constant with depth and dilution. 

Geostatistical analysis and estimation of the dilution per rock type, per kimberlite; 

Integration of calculated grade and density values with estimated dilution; and 

Summarizing of data per lithofacies per kimberlite.

17.4.2 Microdiamond Sample Analysis 

The relationship between microdiamonds and macrodiamonds can be used to establish diamond content for a 

kimberlite. Once established, that relationship can be applied to microdiamond sampling for grade determination. 

Representative samples weighing approximately 200 kg were collected from each underground bulk sample 

round and placed in sealed 205 l drums for storage. Archived material from specific underground rounds, 

representative of specific kimberlite facies, were submitted for standard caustic fusion microdiamond recovery. 

Dilution estimations were made for each caustic sample and were complimented by measured line scan data for 

each underground round.  Dilution estimates were combined with microdiamond and macrodiamond results to 

determine undiluted stones per 10 kg, undiluted stones greater than 0.6 mm per 10 kg, undiluted total stones 

and a model grade (Table 17-3).  The model grade was adjusted to reflect non-recovery of small stones due to 

DMS plant inefficiencies (i.e. the adjusted model grade is lower than the unadjusted model grade).

To demonstrate continuity of mineralization and stability of the diamond population with depth in the Renard 2 

body, sampling was undertaken on 50 m levels (horizontal slices) from beneath the previous RC and 

underground sampling to the base of the body at ~700 m (-200 masl) below the  land surface. From each 50 m 

level, approximately 200 kg of Kimb2a and Kimb2b was collected from the 2009 drill core and treated for 

microdiamond recovery. A total of 2,046.93 kilograms of unit Kimb2a and 1889.20 kilograms of unit Kimb2b were 

analyzed by standard caustic fusion processing. The results for Kimb2a and Kimb2b are presented in Figures 

17.1 and 17.2 respectively, as stones per hundred tonnes per unit interval plots which demonstrate that grades 

remain consistent with depth.

17.4.3 Diamond Size Frequency Modelling 

Diamond size frequency modelling was undertaken for all remaining kimberlite lithologies to determine undiluted 

grades for all units (Table 17-4). This was carried out primarily using the macrodiamond samples and fitting the 

curves to remain parallel to the microdiamond curves established for each pipe.

17.4.4 Mixed Sample Deconvolution 

Deconvolution is the process of calculating individual lithofacies grades from mixed samples. Representative 

microdiamond and macrodiamond data for essentially pure Kimb3b and Kimb3c units were not available for 

grade modeling. Undiluted grades have been estimated through a back calculation methodology. Based on 

volume calculations from underground survey and mapping data, the proportion of undiluted Kimb3h, Kimb3d/g 

and Kimb3c have been calculated for underground rounds 3107, 3006, and 3008. The proportional contribution 

of total carats attributable to unit Kimb3d/g and Kimb3h was calculated based on pure grade calculations (see 

Table 17-4). This carat contribution was removed from the overall recovered carat total for each bulk sample 

round and the remainder attributed to the Kimb3c unit. The resulting weighted average grade for the Kimb3c unit 

is 230 cpht (Table 17-5). A similar exercise was conducted for the Kimb3b unit and involved bulk sample rounds 

3104 and 3105 which are mixtures of Kimb3h, Kimb3d/g and Kimb3b. The undiluted proportion of carats was 

calculated for Kimb3h, and Kimb3d and removed from the total carats recovered from the bulk sample rounds. 

The remaining carats were assigned to unit Kimb3b and the weighted average grade for Kimb3b is 101 cpht. 

(Table 17-5).

17.4.5 Intrusions Kimb2c and Kimb4c 

Individual Kimb2c or Kimb4c intersections are very difficult if not impossible to correlate between drill holes and, 

where encountered in the underground decline on Renard 2, tend to be irregular in shape, orientation and both 

lateral and vertical continuity. These hypabyssal intrusives are present throughout the Renard 2 and Renard 4 

bodies, but are too fragmented to model independently. Analysis of drill core showed a consistent proportion of 

the Kimb2c and Kimb4c in the respective bodies.  In Renard 2 the average contribution of Kimb2c into the 

Kimb2a unit is 15.7%, and in the Kimb2b unit it is 18.1%. For Renard 4, the percentage of Kimb4c present in the 

dominant Kimb4a was calculated at 9%.  

17.4.6 Dilution Sampling Analysis 

Table 17-6 lists the sampling undertaken to establish dilution models. Different methods of dilution determination 

were employed by Stornoway over time. The most recent method used being "Line Scans", where the amount of 

dilution in each metre of core was measured in a quantitative and consistent manner. For Renard 2, only the line 

scan data was utilized to establish the dilution models. The older method, known as "Modal", employed a visual 

estimate per geological unit. Whilst coarser in resolution, where sufficient data coverage exists, modal data 

yields similar overall dilution figures to the line scan data. Due to the paucity of line scan data in bodies other 

than Renard 2, modal data was used to develop the dilution models. It is recommended that all available core 

from the other bodies be line scanned.

In certain kimberlites, the average bulk density of kimberlite lithologies may change with increasing depth due to 

a variety of factors, including alteration, dilution, magmatic variation, etc. Some 205 bulk density measurements 

available from kimberlite units within the Renard 2 body are graphically displayed in Figure 17.3. The surface of 

the Renard 2 body is at 510 masl and the individual samples have been positioned at the center of the same 

50 m level slices being used for ongoing microdiamond sampling (e.g., 450 masl to 500 masl). The second layer

down, plotted at 445 m, represents the level of underground sampling. For the most part the samples for each of 

the three Renard 2 kimberlite lithologies tend to cluster in a narrow density range, and it is considered that, for 

this study, density is constant with depth.  

Figure 17.3: Density by Depth for Renard 2 

Much of the Renard kimberlite material contains a significant contribution of country rock xenoliths. These 

xenoliths could be expected to have an impact on the density of the samples, for example, if the density of 

country rock is greater than that of the host kimberlite. However, alteration of xenoliths in the kimberlite can be 

quite pronounced in some cases, which would tend to lower the overall bulk density of the kimberlite. A series of 

some 91 bulk density samples from recent core drilling in and around the Renard 2 kimberlite were line scanned 

prior to density determinations in an effort to establish a quantitative dilution estimate. The results are plotted in 

Figure 17.4. There is minimal correlation between the sample results as shown, suggesting that country rock 

dilution has a minimal effect on density.

17.4.8 Model Setup 

A block model size of 5 m x 5 m x 5 m was selected as most appropriate to represent the small size of the 

kimberlite pipes, and as best suited to accommodate open pit mine planning, which is currently based on 

increments of 5 m bench heights (e.g., 10 m, 15 m). The block model is not rotated and incorporated each of 

Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4 and Renard 9.   

17.4.9 Estimation Process 

The Ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation method was used to estimate the country rock dilution into the block 

model using variography parameters defined from the geostatistical analysis and summarized in Table 17-8. 

Inverse distance squared (ID2) and nearest neighbour (NN) models were run to validate the kriging interpolation.

17.4.10 Integration Process 

For each kimberlite lithology, the undiluted grade for the block was multiplied by the estimate of the dilution for 

the block. For each rock type, if a factor was required to account for the unmodelled Kimb2c/Kimb3c/Kimb4c 

component, this was applied. In the block model the resulting grade was multiplied by the proportion of the rock 

type in the block, the relevant density was applied to each rock type and the results summed to establish the 

total carats and tonnes in the block.  

Available information for the Lynx and Hibou dykes was examined and average grades from the bulk samples 

assigned as appropriate grades for the bodies.   

17.5 Validation 

Amongst many issues checked, dilution is the crucial key to this estimation. In Figures 17.5 and 17.6 are the 

estimates of dilution shown against the measured dilution.

17.6 Diamond Price Estimates 

Three separate valuation exercises have been undertaken on diamonds from the Foxtrot Property between 

September 2007 and September 2009, and diamond price models determined for the Renard 2, Renard 3 and 

Renard 4 kimberlite pipes and the Lynx and Hibou kimberlite dykes. In addition, reviews of the diamond size 

frequency distributions of certain samples have been undertaken to best assess the appropriate diamond price 

models to be applied to each kimberlite body for resource estimation purposes. Successive diamond price 

models, and the diamond prices assumed for the Mineral Resource Estimate, are summarized in Tables 17-9 

and 17-10.

17.6.1 Diamond Valuations and Price Modelling, September 2007 to September 2009 

September 2007 Valuation 

During the period September 24 to 28, 2007, three parcels of diamonds recovered during the 2007 bulk sample 

program from the Renard 2, Renard 3 and Renard 4 kimberlite pipes were presented for an initial valuation in 

Antwerp, Belgium, under the supervision of WWW International Diamond Consultants Ltd. (WWW), an 

internationally recognized diamond valuation and consulting company. WWW, with its aboriginal partners, 

Aboriginal Diamonds Group Limited, comprises Diamonds International Canada Ltd., and are the valuators to 

the Federal Government of Canada for the Canadian diamond mines in the Northwest Territories, and to the 

provincial government of Ontario for the Victor Diamond Mine. 

In addition to performing its own valuation, WWW showed the diamond samples to three other experienced 

Antwerp-based rough diamond valuators in order to obtain additional market based valuations (an "open market" 

valuation). The results of this exercise were (1) an "observed" diamond price, which represents the average of 

the four valuations on the sample of diamonds presented, and (2) a "modelled" price estimate, with high and low 

sensitivities.

The modelled price estimate, as determined by WWW, incorporates separate models for diamond size 

frequency distribution and price per diamond size class. All prices cited were calculated using a +1 DTC sieve 

size cut-off. The "base case" model represents an average diamond price in the (then) current rough diamond 

market that might reasonably have been expected for each kimberlite body based on standard production-scale 

recoveries of all commercial sized diamonds. Diamond price models correct, principally, for an absence of large 

diamonds which are typically under-represented at this scale of sampling.  

In this first diamond valuation exercise, WWW assessed the Renard 2 and Renard 3 samples to be 

representative of the same population of diamonds in terms of diamond qualities and size distribution, and 

recommended that a modelled base case diamond price estimate of US$109 per carat be adopted for both

bodies, with a "High" modelled price estimate of US$122 per carat and a "Low" modelled price estimate of 

US$105 per carat. WWW noted that both the Renard 2 and Renard 3 samples are characterized by the 

presence of large, high-value gems which have a strong influence on the resultant diamond price. For both of 

these kimberlite bodies, WWW felt that achieving a diamond  price less than the 'Low" modelled diamond price 

was unlikely in a production setting, and that achieving the "High" modelled diamond price was a reasonable 

expectation given the continued recovery of these larger gems. 

WWW further recommended a modelled base case diamond price estimate of US$69 per carat be adopted for 

the Renard 4 NCZ sample, with sensitivities of US$73 per carat and US$63 per carat. WWW noted that the 

Renard 4 diamond sample differs from the other samples in that it has an apparent relative absence of larger 

diamonds. Its lower modelled price estimate was principally a function of this finer diamond size distribution.  

March 2008 Valuation 

During the period March 26 to 28, 2008, the Renard 2, Renard 3 and Renard 4 diamond samples were re-valued 

by WWW against their current rough price book, and the diamond price models for each kimberlite body were 

updated. This exercise comprised restating the diamond assortments created during the September 2007 

valuation exercise with March 2008 pricing, and applying an adjustment factor to the diamond price model 

accordingly. The Renard 4 price model also incorporated new valuation data from an additional 504 cts of 

diamonds from sample 4003, which was collected in 2006 as part of the bulk sample program and processed 

subsequent to the September 2007 valuation exercise. In addition, diamond parcels from the Lynx and Hibou 

kimberlite dykes were presented for valuation in Antwerp for the first time, again under the supervision of WWW, 

and utilizing two other Antwerp-based experienced rough diamond valuators. 

Using their March 2008 price book, WWW recommended a revised modelled base case diamond price estimate 

for both the Renard 2 and 3 kimberlite pipes of US$121 per carat, with sensitivities of US$136 per carat and 

US$108 per carat. This was an 11% increase compared to the September 2007 diamond price model. WWW 

recommended a revised modelled base case diamond price estimate for the Renard 4 kimberlite pipe of  

US$79 per carat, with sensitivities of US$87 per carat and US$71 per carat. This was a 14% increase compared 

to the previous diamond price model.  

WWW further recommended a modelled base case diamond price estimate for the Lynx kimberlite dyke of 

US$66 per carat, with sensitivities of US$97 per carat and US$56 per carat. The Lynx diamond valuation parcel 

comprises 520 cts of diamonds recovered during 2007 from two trenches located along the surface trace of the 

dyke. The parcel includes a 21 carat stone which was broken during sample processing and recovered in 

principally three fragments, the largest of which weighs 11.73 cts. The Lynx diamond parcel differs from those of 

Renard 2, Renard 3 and Renard 4 in that it contains a higher proportion of brown diamonds and has a finer 

diamond size distribution.  

During the March 2008 valuation exercise, WWW also performed a valuation on a 39 carat parcel of diamonds 

recovered from trenching on the Hibou kimberlite dyke between 2005 and 2006. This small parcel of diamonds 

was valued by WWW alone, who determined an "observed" (un-modelled) price of US$42 per carat. Owing to 

the size of the parcel, no diamond price modelling exercise was possible. However WWW, in noting a similar 

assortment of diamond qualities and colours in Hibou as in Lynx, recommended that, for planning purposes, a

Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009

diamond price of US$66 per carat be adopted for the Hibou kimberlite dyke conditional upon the future collection 

of a bulk sample that demonstrated a diamond size distribution at Hibou similar to that seen at Lynx.  

The results of the March 2008 valuation and diamond price modelling exercise were incorporated into the 

previous NI 43-101 (Lecuyer et al., 2008).  In January 2009, subsequent to the initial publication of the Technical 

Report, an additional 781 cts of diamonds were recovered from a large scale trench sample extracted from the 

Hibou kimberlite dyke. An analysis of the diamond size distribution and quality assortment of this sample 

confirmed the similarity of the diamond populations of the Hibou and Lynx dykes, and the verified the adoption of 

a single diamond price estimate for both bodies.  

September 2009 Valuation 

In light of the volatility within the rough diamond market which was widely reported during the course of late 2008 

and early 2009, WWW were re-engaged in late September 2009 to provide an updated re-valuation of the 

Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4 and Lynx diamond samples. As in the March 2008 exercise, WWW restated the 

diamond assortments created during the September 2007 valuation exercise with September 2009 pricing, and 

applied an adjustment factor to the diamond price model accordingly. The 781 cts Hibou diamond sample was 

not valued. 

Using their most recent price book, WWW recommended a revised modelled base case diamond price estimate 

for both the Renard 2 and Renard 3 kimberlite pipes of US$117 per carat, with sensitivities of US$131 per carat 

and US$103 per carat. This was a 3% decrease compared to the previous diamond price model. WWW 

recommended a revised modelled base case diamond price estimate for the Renard 4 kimberlite pipe of US$75 

per carat, with sensitivities of US$82 per carat and US$65 per carat. This was a 5% decrease compared to the 

March 2008 diamond price model. WWW recommended a revised modelled base case diamond price estimate 

for the Lynx kimberlite dyke of US$57 per carat, with sensitivities of US$85 per carat and US$48 per carat. This 

was a 14% decrease compared to the previous diamond price model. 

17.6.2 Review of Diamond Size Frequency Distributions 

In the diamond price modelling exercises of March 2008 and September 2009, WWW noted the similar diamond 

qualities within the complete Renard 4 diamond sample compared to those of Renard 2 and Renard 3, and a 

single diamond price per size class model was adopted for each kimberlite body. However, whereas the 

Renard 2 and Renard 3 samples also have a very similar diamond size frequency distribution, the Renard 4 

sample has a lower incidence of large diamonds and produces an apparently "finer" diamond size distribution, 

and consequently has a lower assessed diamond price. A lower price for the Renard 4 body was adopted for 

resource declaration and economic assessment in the previous Preliminary Assessment (Lecuyer et al, 2009).  

No bulk sample has been collected at the Renard 9 kimberlite, and consequently no stand-alone diamond 

valuation exists for this kimberlite body. However, based on size frequency distributions, Stornoway concluded 

that Renard 9 should be taken as showing the same diamond size frequency distribution as Renard 4, and that 

pending any future large-scale sampling, the same diamond valuation model should apply.  



2009 MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE 

Revised Date:  January 27, 2010 
Initial Report Date:  January 21, 2010 
Effective Date:  December 8, 2009 
Project No. 09-1439-0001 110 

Since this time, a more thorough review of the nature of the Renard 4 diamond bulk sample has been 

undertaken so as to determine a single diamond price estimate for the Renard 4 kimberlite (and by association 

the Renard 9 kimberlite) in the current Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate. This review has 

addressed: 

Comparative size frequency distributions of the diamond sample data; 

Comparative diamond breakage analysis of the diamond sample data; 

Analysis of process plant performance for each sample and its potential impact on diamond sample 

recoveries; and 

Comparative diamond quality assortments of the Renard bulk samples. 

This review has confirmed that the diamond bulk samples from Renard 2, Renard 3 and Renard 4 show a large 

degree of similarity in their size frequency distributions, particularly when using a cumulative stone probability or 

normalized grade per unit analysis. An additional, internal analysis of comparative quality assortment data 

confirmed no material difference in diamond assortment and value per size class between the Renard 2, Renard 

3 and Renard 4 bulk samples. Deviations in the cumulative carat probability plot for the Renard 4 sample, from 

which a valuation model is derived, can be attributed to grade loss through diamond breakage or stone loss in 

the DTC sieve classes greater than 3 GR in size. An independent analysis of diamond breakage in each 

diamond bulk sample, conducted by Dr. Paddy Lawless for Golder between August and September 2009, 

confirmed that there is an anomalous level of diamond breakage that can be discerned in the Renard 4 bulk 

sample compared to the Renard 2 and Renard 3 bulk samples. The relative proportions of this breakage, when 

quantified in terms of grade loss, are consistent with that implied by the size frequency distribution analysis. The 

Renard bulk samples were processed at the 10 tph DMS plant at LagopÃ¨de, and process plant records confirm 

significant issues of concern with the processing of several Renard 4 bulk sample rounds that might have led to 

both diamond loss and diamond breakage. In addition, the fewer number of Renard 4 bulk sample rounds, and 

their larger size, made issues of stone recovery in individual rounds proportionally more impactful to the diamond 

size frequency distribution of the resulting Renard 4 diamond sample than was the case for Renard 2 or 

Renard 3. 

Consequently, Golder has concluded that the size frequency distributions of Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4 and 

Renard 9 are similar, and that it is appropriate to use a single size frequency distribution to determine value on 

the basis that there exists a single diamond population within the four kimberlite pipes. Consistent with this 

approach, a modelled base case diamond price estimate of US$117 per carat has been adopted for each body 

in the current Technical Report and the Mineral Resource Estimate. Likewise, a modelled base case diamond 

price estimate of US$57 per carat has been adopted for both the Lynx and Hibou kimberlite dykes.

17.7 Comparative Historical Valuation Data 

In April 2005, a total 459 carat sample of diamonds collected by RC drilling from four separate Renard 

kimberlites (Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4 and Renard 65) was valued by WWW with an observed  

(un-modelled) price of US$70 per carat. At this time, WWW concluded, based on the available data, that the four 

separate kimberlite subsamples were consistent with a single population of diamonds. WWW recommended a 

single modelled price estimate of US$88 per carat, with sensitivities of US$104 per carat and US$74 per carat. 

The subsequent diamond valuation results for the significantly larger parcels associated with the Renard 2 and 

Renard 3 bulk samples (September 2007, March 2008 and September 2009), and the diamond price model 

adopted for the Renard 2, Renard 3 and Renard 4 kimberlite bodies, all exceed this previous diamond price 

model. 

17.8 Mineral Resource Classification 

Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (CIM) standards and Securities Commission disclosure regulations 
require that a mineral resource can only be declared on a mineral deposit which has "reasonable prospects of 
economic extraction". Based on the March 2009 Preliminary Assessment, where a smaller overall tonnage and 
diamond content proved to be economically viable, the improvement in overall tonnage and diamond content 
should support that the new mineral resource has reasonable prospects of economic extraction.  

The reported Mineral Resources for the Renard Project kimberlites that meet these criteria were constrained by 
Golder using drill density and sample distribution. Classification of the resources in diamonds is an inclusive 
process, looking at aspects of geology, grade, revenue, density, diamond size frequency and continuity.  

For the Renard kimberlite pipes, the Indicated Resource classification incorporates areas where substantial 
sampling has been undertaken. For Renard 2 this includes the RC, underground bulk samples and 
microdiamond sampling to 600 m. For the other pipes it is limited to the RC hole depths which indicate grade 
continuity. These depths are supported by the more extensive core drilling which is sufficient to delineate the 
resources at an Indicated level from the geological/lithological/volumetric/density aspect.  

Sufficient carats have been recovered for revenue analysis and support that the revenue is at the Indicated level 
of confidence.  

17.8.1 Reasonable Prospects of Economic Extraction 

The reasonable prospect of economic extraction was outlined in the previous Technical Report (reference) and 

preliminary assessment.  The parameters used in the preliminary assessment have not changed significantly 

(except the resource is larger) and upon review Golder considers the resource has reasonable prospects for 

economic extraction.

17.9 Mineral Resource Statement 

The Mineral Resource Estimate for the Renard Project, which has an effective date of December 8, 2009, is 

summarized in Tables 17-11 and 17-12. The Qualified Person for the estimate is David Farrow, P.Geo. 

The Mineral Resource Estimate takes into account geological, mining, processing and economic constraints and 

are classified in accordance with the 2005 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral 

Reserves. Golder cautions that mineral resources are not mineral reserves until they have demonstrated 

economic viability. 

The Mineral Resource Estimate is based on the continuity of geology between kimberlite at depth and kimberlite 

nearer surface and the generally low variation in sample results for the different kimberlite phases with depth.  

Golder notes that there is potential for additional volume at depth for the Renard Project, as the geological 

models have been constructed conservatively in areas of limited drilling.  

The indicated tonnage reported in Table 17-11 and the inferred tonnage in Table 17-12 lie within the solid model 

shells. Tonnage and grade estimates include estimation of internal dilution (barren material) within each body. 

There is some potential for additional mineralization in the Lynx northern extension area, where the trace of the 

kimberlite dyke extends for at least 2 km beyond the Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate confines.

17.10 Potential Mineral Deposit 

In addition, Potential Mineral Deposits (PMD) were identified on the various kimberlites. PMD are derived 

from geological volumes based on projection at a standard 85Â° of the pipe margin in pipes or to within 50 m 

of known borehole intersections in case of the dykes. These are detailed in Table 17-13 as low and high 

ranges, both of which are considered to be geologically realistic. Total PMD was identified as being 

between 27 and 46 million tonnes, containing between 12 and 26 million carats of diamonds, at an average 

grade of 46 cpht to 58 cpht.  These were defined on a basis of outcrops, limited delineation drilling and 

surface sampling.  The potential quantity and grade of any potential mineral deposit is conceptual in nature, 

there is insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will 

result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.

Substantial increases to the volumes of the Renard kimberlite bodies, due to additional drilling and subsequent 

modelling, are responsible for the major differences between the results of the previous Mineral Resource 

Estimate and the current estimate.

19.0 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 

The interpretations and conclusions that have been identified from the 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate Update 

are:  

Most geological aspects of the Renard Project are reasonably well understood. 

The Renard 2, Renard, 3, Renard 4, Renard 9 and Renard 65 pipes, as well as the Lynx and Hibou dyke 

systems contain diamond concentrations that have the potential to be economic. 

Drilling of the Renard 2 kimberlite has significantly increased the mineral resource of the project, primarily a 

function of identifying additional resource at depth, which is less diluted and higher grade. 

The project database was reviewed by Golder using statistical and geostatistical analyses and comparisons 

between paper sources and the digital database. This database is considered acceptable for mineral 

resource estimation. 

The results of the latest Mineral Resource Estimate are tabulated in Tables 19-1 and 19-2. The Mineral 

Resource Estimate is based on the continuity of geology between kimberlite at depth and kimberlite nearer 

surface, and the generally low variation in sample results for the different kimberlite phases with depth. 

There is additional potential for the Renard Project, as the geological models for Renard 3, Renard 4, 

Renard 65, and Renard 9 are based on conservative shapes for the kimberlites at depth, and the evaluation 

models do not incorporate areas of limited drilling at depth. The PMD are detailed in Table 19-3. Total PMD 

was identified as representing between 27 and 46 million tonnes, containing between 12 and 26 million 

carats of diamonds, at an average grade of 46 to 58 cpht. These were defined on a basis of geological-

modelling, outcrop mapping, limited delineation drilling and surface sampling.  The potential quantity and 

grade of any potential mineral deposit is conceptual in nature, there is insufficient exploration to define a 

mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

The recommendations that have been identified from the 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate Update are: 

Complete an update of the 2008 Preliminary Assessment is recommended to investigate what percentage 

of the Mineral Resource Estimate described in this Technical Report could be converted to a Mineral 

Reserve (estimated cost of $250,000). The outcomes of this recommended revision to the Preliminary 

Assessment would help to guide further work on the various kimberlite bodies. 

Complete a simulation study on the current pipe shapes (Renard 2, Renard 3, Renard 4 and Renard 9) 

should be conducted to quantify the levels of uncertainty in the volumetric determination of the various 

pipes and their internal phases (estimated cost of $75,000). 

All available core from the Renard 3, Renard 4 and Renard 9 kimberlites should be line scanned (minimal 

cost as this can be completed by geologists employed by Stornoway).
