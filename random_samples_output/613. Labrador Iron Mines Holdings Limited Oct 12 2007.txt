1.0 Summary (Item 3.0) 
On March 29, 2007 SNC-Lavalin was mandated to prepare a Technical Report 
covering the geological work carried out for the iron project owned by 
Labrador Iron Mines Limited (LIM) in northwestern Labrador.  The study had to 
be prepared following the requirements of the NI 43-101 and contain a budget 
estimate of the exploration program that would allow the resources to be 
classified according to the standards prescribed by NI 43-101, and which would 
be acceptable input for a Feasibility Study and an economic analysis.  The 
findings, conclusions and recommendations are based solely on the information 
provided by LIM which consisted of reports, sections and plans prepared by Iron 
Ore Company of Canada (IOCC) during 1954 to 1982, and reports prepared for 
other subsequent owners of the properties, as well as reports of exploration and 
sampling activities of LIM.   

Property Description and Location 

Labrador Iron Mines Limited holds title to 29 Mineral Rights Licenses issued by 
the Department of Natural Resources, Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, 
representing 140 mineral claims located in northwest Labrador.  The LIM 
properties are located in the western central part of the Labrador Trough iron 
range and are located about 1,000 km northeast of Montreal and adjacent to or 
within 70 km from the town of Schefferville (Quebec).   

There are no roads connecting the area to southern Labrador or to Quebec.  
Access to the area is by rail from Sept-Îles to Schefferville or by air from Montreal 
and Sept-Îles.  The properties are located inside a 70 km radius from 
Schefferville.  The James, Houston, Knob Lake and Redmond deposits are within 
20 km from Schefferville and form the first group of properties from which mining 
would commence.  The Sawyer Lake and Astray Lake properties are some 50 to 
65 km southeast from Schefferville and cut off from the local infrastructure by 
connected lakes.  The Howse and Kivivic deposits are some 25 and 45 km 
northwest from Schefferville.  IOCC had excavation activities close to all 
properties other than Sawyer and Astray Lake.

History 

The Quebec-Labrador iron range has a tradition of mining since the early 1950's 
and is one of the largest iron producing regions in the world.  The former direct 
shipping iron ore operations at Schefferville (Quebec and Labrador) operated by 
IOCC produced in excess of 150 million tons of lump and sinter fine ores over the 
period 1954-1982.  The first serious exploration in the Labrador Trough occurred 
in the late 1930s and early 1940's when Hollinger North Shore Exploration 
Company Limited (Hollinger) and Labrador Mining and Exploration Mining 
Company Limited acquired large mineral concessions in the Quebec and 
Labrador portions of the Trough.  Mining and shipping from the Hollinger lands 
began in 1954 under the management of the IOCC, a company specifically 
formed to exploit the Schefferville area iron deposits.   

As the technology of the steel industry changed over the ensuing years more 
emphasis was placed on the concentrating ores of the Wabush area and interest 
and markets for the direct shipping Schefferville ores declined.  Finally, in 1982, 
the IOCC closed their operations in the Schefferville area.  

Following the closure of the IOCC mining operations, ownership of the leases 
reverted to Hollinger and the mining rights held by IOCC in Labrador reverted to 
the Crown.  Between September 2003 and March 2006, Fenton and 
Graeme Scott, New Millennium Capital Corp. and Energold Minerals Inc. began 
staking claims over the soft iron ores in the Labrador part of the Schefferville 
camp.  Recognizing a need to consolidate the mineral ownership, Energold and 
subsequently LIM, has entered in to agreements with the various parties.  All of 
the properties comprising LIM's Schefferville area project were part of the original 
IOCC Schefferville holdings and formed part of the 250 million tons of reserves 
and resources identified by IOCC in the area. 

Geology 

At least 45 hematite-goethite ore deposits have been discovered in an area 
20 km wide that extends 100 km northwest of Astray Lake, referred to as the 
Knob Lake Iron Range, which consists of a tightly folded and faulted iron-
formation exposed along the height of land that forms the boundary between 
Quebec and Labrador. The Knob Lake properties are located on the western 
margin of the Labrador Trough adjacent to Archean basement gneisses.  The 
Central or Knob Lake Range section extends for 550 km south from the Koksoak 
River to the Grenville Front located 30 km north of Wabush Lake. The principal 
iron formation unit, the Sokoman Formation, part of the Knob Lake Group, forms 
a continuous stratigraphic unit that thickens and thins from sub-basin to sub-
basin throughout the fold belt. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 1-3 Mining & Metallurgy 

The sedimentary rocks in the Knob Lake Range strike northwest, and their 
corrugated surface appearance is due to parallel ridges of quartzite and iron 
formation which alternate with low valleys of shales and slates.  The Hudsonian 
Orogeny compressed the sediments into a series of synclines and anticlines, 
which are cut by steep angle reverse faults that dip primarily to the east. The 
synclines are overturned to the southwest with the east limits commonly 
truncated by strike faults. Most of the secondary earthy textured iron deposits 
occur in canoe-shaped synclines, some are tabular bodies extending to a depth 
of at least 200m, and one or two deposits are relatively flat lying and cut by 
several faults. Subsequent supergene processes converted some of the iron 
formations into high-grade ores, preferentially in synclinal depressions and/or 
down-faulted blocks.  

The Labrador Trough contains four main types of iron deposits: 

 Soft iron ores formed by supergene leaching and enrichment of the 
weakly metamorphosed cherty iron formation; they are composed mainly 
of friable fine-grained secondary iron oxides (hematite, goethite, limonite); 

 Taconites, the fine-grained, weakly metamorphosed iron formations with 
above average magnetite content and which are also commonly called 
magnetite iron formation; 

 More intensely metamorphosed, coarser-grained iron formations, termed 
metataconites which contain specular hematite and subordinate amounts 
of magnetite as the dominant iron minerals; 

 Minor occurrences of hard high-grade hematite ore occur southeast of 
Schefferville at Swayer Lake, Astray Lake and in some of the Houston 
deposits. 

The deposits that form part of the LIM project are: 

 James Deposit which is a northeast dipping elongated iron deposit with a 
direction of N330° in its main axis and it appears to be structurally and 
stratigraphically controlled. 

 Knob Lake Deposit which is a northeast dipping ellipsoidal iron deposit 
with a direction of N330° in its main axis and it appears to be structurally 
and stratigraphically controlled. 

 Houston Deposits which comprises three separate bodies that are 
referred to as Houston 1, Houston 2S and Houston 3 deposits.  Iron 
mineralization of potential direct shipping quality extends NW-SE for 
5 kilometres by 150  metres in its wider zone. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 1-4 Mining & Metallurgy 

 Redmond Deposit which are developed along a northwest trending 
synclinal that extends to the south to the Redmond No.1 deposit and to 
the north to the Wishart mine. 

 Astray Lake Deposit which is a northeast dipping undefined iron deposit 
located approximately 500m northeast from the eastern shore of Astray 
Lake and on the west side of a steeply sided NW-SE trending ridge. 

 Sawyer Lake Deposit which is a medium-sized iron deposit located 
approximately 1.6 km northwest of Sawyer Lake.  

 Howse and Kivivic Deposits for which the geological database is more 
limited than for the other deposits.  Howse was one of the last deposits to 
be discovered by IOCC. The property is located under a thick layer of 
overburden (~ 10 - 20 metres) that makes surface exploration very 
difficult.  

Second stage of enrichment included the addition of secondary iron and 
manganese which appear to have moved in solution and filled pore spaces with 
limonite-goethite.  Secondary manganese minerals, i.e., pyrolusite and 
manganite, form veinlets and vuggy pockets.  The types of iron ores developed in 
the deposits are directly related to the original mineral facies. The predominant 
blue granular ore was formed from the oxide facies of the middle iron formation.  
The yellowish-brown ore, composed of limonite-goethite, formed from the 
carbonate-silicate facies, and the red painty hematite ore originated from mixed 
facies in the argillaceous slaty members.  Only the direct shipping ore is 
considered beneficiable to produce lumps and sinter feed and will be part of the 
resources for the Labrador Iron Mines project.  The direct shipping ore was 
classified by IOCC in six categories based on their chemical, mineralogical and 
textural compositions.  This classification is still used in the evaluation of the 
mineralization.  The following six ore categories and two other mineralization 
categories not part of the potential economic mineralization, are: 

 High Non-Bessemer (HNB) red, yellow and blue. 

 Lean Non Bessemer (LNB) red, yellow and blue. 

 High Silica (HiSiO2)  (waste). 

 Treat Rock (TRX) (waste but previously stockpiled for 
possible later treatment).

Exploration 

Most exploration on the properties was carried out by IOCC until the closure of 
their operation in the 1980s.  Most data used in the evaluation of the current 
status of the resource and reserve evaluation is provided in the documents, 
sections and maps produced by IOCC or by consultants working for them.  A 
recent program of exploration was carried out by LIM during 2005 and 2006.  A 
short program of bulk sampling was carried out in 2006 as well.  Bulk sampling 
was completed in two stages.  The first stage consisted of trenching and 
sampling mineralization from Houston 1, the second stage consisted of trenching 
and sampling mineralization from James deposit. 

Ongoing exploration on LIM's Schefferville area properties will essentially focus 
at two or three different levels depending upon the proposed development 
schedule for the particular deposit.  At the James and Houston deposits that are 
currently at the most advanced stage, additional verification reverse circulation 
drilling will be required to enable the classification of mineable reserves and 
resources and be compliant with NI 43-101.  In addition, further bulk sampling for 
metallurgical testing is necessary prior to adoption of the final process flow sheet.  

Drilling and Sampling 

Diamond drilling of the Schefferville iron deposits has been a problem historically 
in that the alternating hard and soft ore zones tend to preclude good core 
recovery.  Traditionally IOCC used a combination of reverse circulation drilling, 
diamond drilling and trenching to generate data for reserve and resource 
calculation.  A large number of original IOCC data have been recovered and 
reviewed by LIM.  For the most recent calculations of the resources for the 
James deposit data of 105 reverse circulation drill holes has been used.  The 
systematic drilling has been carried out on sections 100 feet (30 metres) apart.  

During the time that IOCC owned the properties sampling of the exploration 
targets were by trenches and test pits as well as drilling.  In the test pits and 
trenches geological mapping determined the lithologies and the samples were 
taken over 10  feet (= 3.0 metres).  The results were plotted on vertical cross 
sections.  All drilling and sampling of the iron deposits covered in this study has 
been done by IOCC during the time that they owned and produced from the 
properties (from 1954 to 1982), with the exception of a short drilling campaign 
(11 holes) carried out by LIM in 2006.   



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 1-6 Mining & Metallurgy 

The trench sampling and geological interpretation of the zones was also 
performed by IOCC, again with the exception of a short sampling program 
in 1989 (for Hollinger) and recently, in 2006, by LIM.  The sample preparation, 
analysis and security in place during the operations of IOCC is not known but it 
can be assumed that it was following the standards for an experienced mining 
company at that time. 

Metallurgical Testing 

During February 1989 three mineralized samples comprising approximately 
12.7 tonnes or 45 drums of James ore were treated at Lakefield Research 
Laboratories (now SGS-Lakefield), Lakefield, Ontario.  In 1990, a bulk sample of 
mineralized material from James deposit weighing approximately three tonnes 
was transported to Centre de Recherches Minerales (CdRM), Quebec City, for 
testing. 

Bulk samples from trenches at James deposit and Houston deposits were 
collected during the summer of 2006 from two trenches 113 metres and 
78 metres long respectively.  Three bulk samples of some 400 kg each were 
collected from the James deposit trench and four bulk samples of some 600 kg 
each were collected from the Houston deposit trench for testing.   

The testing for compressive strength, crusher index and abrasion index were 
done at SGS Lakefield.  The composite crushing, dry and wet screen 
analysis, washing and classification tests were done at 
"rpc - The Technical Solutions Centre" in Fredericton, New Brunswick.  The 
specific density tests have shown that there is a possibility that the average SG is 
higher than the 3.5 kg/t which was used in the IOCC calculations.  Additional bulk 
sample testing will be carried out during the confirmation exploration program.  
The SG data will be used in the calculations of the resource and reserve volumes 
while the chemical test results will be used to compare them with the historical 
IOCC data from neighboring drill holes.

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 

All resource estimates quoted in this report are based on prior data and reports 
prepared by IOCC, the previous operator.  These historical estimates are not 
current and do not meet NI 43-101 Definition Standards and are reported here for 
historical purposes only.  A qualified person has not done sufficient work to 
classify the historical estimate as current mineral reserves.  The historical 
estimates should not be relied upon.  These historical results provide an 
indication of the potential of the properties and are relevant to ongoing 
exploration. 

The IOCC estimated mineral resources and reserves were published in their 
Direct-Shipping Ore (DSO) Reserve Book published in 1983.  The estimate was 
based on geological interpretations on cross sections and the calculations were 
done manually.  The Table 1-1 shows the summary of the estimate of the mineral 
resources of the by LIM owned deposits.  IOCC categorized their estimates as 
"reserves".  SNC has adopted the principle that these should be categorized at 
"resources" as defined by NI 43-101.

This table should be read in conjunction with the footnotes shown below Table 17.1 

 

In 1995 Kilborn Inc. (at that time an independent engineering company with the 
head office in Toronto) carried out a project Development Plan study for Hollinger 
North Shore Exploration Inc.  The historic reserve estimates of IOCC, prepared in 
1982, for the Labrador and Quebec properties were reviewed.  The processing 
estimates were based on metallurgical test work carried out by Lakefield in 1988 
and 1989.  Kilborn did not produce a NI 43-101 compliant resource statement. 

In 2002, SOQUEM contracted Metchem to prepare an assessment of the 
Hollinger Iron Ore Development Project.  The historic reserve estimates prepared 
by IOCC in 1982, for the Labrador and Quebec properties were again reviewed.  
In the Metchem study the estimated resources were reduced by some 25% to 
allow for the exclusion of the "yellow" ore that would retain moisture and would 
not be processed.  Metchem did not produce a NI 43-101 compliant resource 
statement. 

In 2006, Wardrop Engineering Inc. prepared a computerized resources estimate 
for LIM for the James deposit using data shown on vertical cross sections 
prepared by IOCC for their reserve calculations.  Wardrop did not classify the 
resource. The reported resource was considered indicative of potential for the 
property.   

Conclusions 

The review of the data that was made available to SNC-Lavalin for the Labrador 
Iron Mine Project related to a renewed development of the iron deposits in 
Labrador near Schefferville, Quebec has shown that there is more than sufficient 
merit for an exploration program to verify the resources estimated by IOCC.   

The results of the program will support the undertaking of a feasibility study, 
which will among other things, bring the historic estimates of resources to comply 
with the requirements of NI 43-101.  If the results of this feasibility study are 
positive then subject to financing and permitting it would be expected that the 
properties will move forward to development and production. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 1-9 Mining & Metallurgy 

The resource estimates for the properties comprising LIM's Labrador Iron Project 
were established by IOCC, an experienced iron ore operator, during the 
30+ year period that IOCC successfully operated mines in the Schefferville area 
which were developed on the basis of similar resource estimates.  It is 
reasonable, therefore, to conclude that such historic resources can be easily 
brought to compliance with NI 43-101 requirements with a program of verification 
as recommended herein.  The first step for this study is the confirmation of the 
resources and reserves for the properties and to make the resource estimates 
NI 43-101 compliant.  

The resources from four deposit sites (James, Knob Lake, Houston and 
Redmond) are the closest to the existing Schefferville infrastructure.  Most 
infrastructure is already in place and relative low capital expenditures will be 
required to restore and revamp the old structures and rail yards.  

 

Additional Requirements for Development Properties 

Due to the fact that the same area has been mined for iron over a period of 
almost 30 years by a well established iron production company that still operates 
mines in the Labrador-Quebec Area, the project should not be considered a 
complete "Greenfield project". The short-term strategy will be to establish the 
operation on the best-known deposits of James and Houston close to 
Schefferville and consolidate the regional position of LIM. It is assumed that 
contractors will carry out all mining and materials handling operations. It is also 
likely that LIM will arrange for washing and screening of the iron ore by a 
contractor. 

The initial production can commence with only minimal additions to the current 
existing infrastructure. It is intention of LIM to outsource as much of the direct 
production operations, including camp maintenance and light fleet operation, to 
experienced contractors and facility operators as is practical both from an 
operating and from a financial standpoint. As was the case with IOCC, all mining 
operations will be by conventional open pit mining methods. Relatively low 
stripping ratios of waste over ore will be mined during the life of the operations. 

Iron ore produced by IOCC needed none or only very little processing and that 
only crushing and screening was performed before the ore was loaded on trains 
to be transported to Sept-Îles. It is proposed that during the confirmation 
exploration phase bulk samples will be tested to determine if additional 
processing (washing) will be able to increase the amount of marketable ore. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 1-10 Mining & Metallurgy 

The only means to transport iron ore from Schefferville to sea-ports is by rail. The 
railway originally constructed by IOCC is still available and in operation. It is 
operated by Tshiuetin Rail Transportation Inc. (TRTI), for passenger and light 
freight traffic. An independent preliminary study of the TRTI railway was carried 
out which concluded that the Menihek Subdivision was in very good condition 
despite more than 20 years of under capitalization. However, some refurbishing 
of the tracks, rails and culverts will have to be carried out. LIM will have to 
negotiate an agreement with TRTI and also the Quebec North Shore & Labrador 
Railway (QNS&L) to reach Sept-Îles. 

Schefferville, Quebec is located in Innu territory at an approximate distance of 
2 km from Labrador on the north shore of Knob Lake.  The Menihek power plant 
located 35 km southeast from Schefferville is the only provider of electric power 
to the area and after refurbishing is completed will be sufficient to supply the 
power that LIM would need   In the case of the establishment of the other 
excavation sites, portable generators could be used.  Most of the existing roads 
that provide access to the different properties designated for early development 
(James, Houston, Knob Lake and Redmond) exist and would only need some 
clean-up.  Three processing sites are envisioned for the total life of the project. 
The first one near Schefferville, the second near Astray Lake and the third one 
near Howse and Kivivic. 

LIM has been collecting seasonal baseline data since mid-2006 and has entered 
into preliminary discussions with Federal and Provincial regulators with respect to 
permit applications and specific requirements for project designation. 

Each mine site will be closed after depletion of mineable reserves and restored 
according to regulations. The aim is to carry out the final closures without 
continued monitoring requirements. 

LIM has established an active community relations program since mid-2005 and 
an ongoing effort is made to work very closely with the four First Nations to focus 
on developing and maintaining productive working relations.  Regular meetings 
are held with the different groups and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is 
pending for signature. 

The successful start up of LIM's direct shipping iron ore project will likely be the 
first positive economic stimulus to the northwest Labrador (and Quebec) 
economies in 30 years. It should lead to 20+ years of economic stability.  Cost 
effective and reliable rail transportation is going to be a key component of any 
direct shipping iron ore operations. The TRTI railway company is already owned 
by a consortium of First Nations and provides an ideal basis upon which to 
develop other transportation solutions for the project.  In the construction phase

the project could generate up to 300 jobs with that number falling to about 150 on 
an ongoing production basis. The economic impact of such employment and 
contracting business on the surrounding communities could be very positive and 
lead to the development of other support and service sector jobs and the 
consistent and planned development and growth of the town of Schefferville and 
surrounding communities. 

There is a high level of existing infrastructure in the Shefferville area, and LIM 
currently intends to utilize contractors for the majority of the operational activities 
who will supply their own capital equipment.  It is not possible at this time to 
provide an estimate of capital costs until the exploration work recommended in 
Section 20.0 has been carried out, the historic resource estimates have been 
converted to current NI 43-101 compliant resource estimates and the feasibility 
study completed. 

It is not possible at this time to provide an estimate of operating costs until the 
exploration work recommended in Section 20.0 has been carried out, the historic 
resource estimates have been converted to current NI 43-101 compliant resource 
estimates and the feasibility study completed. 

Capital Cost estimation is based on assumptions that will need to be amended as 
more information becomes available and actual engineering work is established. 
The accuracy of the estimation is assumed to be at conceptual level.  Capital 
expenditures for the first 6 years of operations, when the four principal pits 
(James, Houston, Knob Lake and Redmond) will be developed, would reach 
US$29 million. Cost will predominantly be related to the revamping of the railway 
line and yards, port facilities and environmental testing.  During the 7th year to 
the 9th year, the capital expenditures would be some US$27 million for the 
development of the Astray Lake and Sawyer Lake pits. Major costs would be for 
the railway yards, roads and site services as well as environmental testing.  
During 10th year to the end of the mine life capital expenditures would amount to 
some US$56 million by developing the Howse and Kivivic deposits. Costs in that 
case are due to the extension of the railway lines and yards, power supply, 
processing plant moving and the construction of roads.  

Operating costs have been estimated and discussions were held with a mining 
contractor familiar with the regional conditions and actual operating expenditure 
at Labrador City area. Costs are based on 2006 levels converted from Canadian 
funds to US at the rate of 1.2.  The Operating costs are estimates for Mining, 
Haulage, Processing, Freight, Rail, Unloading and General Administration.  The 
average operating costs per tonne of ore is estimated at US$21.86 (or $26.75 
assuming a 82% recovery of saleable product) for the life of mine operations.

The market for iron ores and related products has seen some substantial 
changes in recent years.  These have been driven in the most part by the 
booming resurgence of the Chinese economy and that country's rapidly 
increasing demand for raw materials particularly steel and its feed product, iron 
ore. This demand in the first instance has been met by increases in Australian 
and, to a lesser extent, Indian and Brazilian supply. 

It is expected that the European market is the most likely destination for products 
from the LIM project given the potential freight advantage over other producers, 
but there remains a strong demand from the Far East and in particular from 
China for iron ore. 

Iron ore prices, other than for pellets and some minor DRI feeds, are based on 
sinter fine prices, with a premium for lump. In practise this lump premium varies, 
thereby establishing a true lump price. 

Recommendations 

Following the review of all supplied data and the interpretation and conclusions of 
this review it is recommended that a three-phase exploration program should be 
started.  The continuation of each phase of the program depends on the 
exploration results obtained and on the evaluation of the new data.  The 
three phases are related to the projection of the possible iron production 
scenarios that are made possible because of the exploration results.  The 
following phases are proposed with only the first phase outlined and budgeted in 
detail. 

 Phase I: Confirm resource data for James, Houston, Knob Lake and 
Redmond deposits and make the resource estimates NI 43-101 compliant 
through reverse circulation drilling and trench sampling.  Magnetometer 
and gravity surveys as well as some trenching and sampling of the Astray 
Lake and Sawyer Lake deposits.  Gravity surveys and general exploration 
of the Howse and Kivivic deposits. 

 Phase II: Additional reverse circulation drilling and trench sampling of the 
Astray Lake and Sawyer Lake deposits and confirmation of the resources 
estimated during Phase I.  

 Phase III: Continued exploration of the Astray Lake and Sawyer Lake 
deposits as well as the Howse and Kivivic deposits to ascertain sufficient 
reserves for continued iron production. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 1-13 Mining & Metallurgy 

The estimated total budget for the Phase I Confirmation Exploration program is 
$ 2,003,000.  The drilling and sampling program must be followed with a 
feasibility study for which the budget estimate is $ 3,310,000.

2.0 Introduction (Item 4.0) 
On March 29, 2007 SNC-Lavalin was mandated to prepare a Technical Report 
covering the geological work carried out for the iron ore project owned by 
Labrador Iron Mines Limited (LIM).  SNC-Lavalin was to review the geological 
and historical data to be supplied by LIM and determine if the project has 
sufficient potential to carry out further confirmation exploration to verify if the 
resource and reserve estimates made by the Iron Ore Company of Canada 
(IOCC) could be made to comply with the standards prescribed by NI 43-101, 
sufficient to carry it through to development of a feasibility study.  This 
exploration program would make reopening of the properties, which include the 
James, Redmond, Knob Lake, Houston, Sawyer Lake, Astray Lake, Howse and 
Kiviviv deposits, that were previously owned by IOCC, a strong possibility 
because it can be assumed that IOCC's estimates were carried out along 
acceptable mining practices of that time.  The study had to be prepared following 
the requirements of NI 43-101 and contain a budget estimate of the exploration 
program that would allow the resources to be classified according to the 
standards prescribed by NI 43-101, and which would be acceptable input for a 
Feasibility Study and an economic analysis. 

An earlier publication of the Technical Report dated September 10 ,2007 includes 
a reference to the preliminary assessment of the property. This amended version 
of the Technical Report has been revised as NI 43-101 requires a current 
resource estimate before that statement can be applied. 

A site visit was made by a representative of SNC-Lavalin from May 2-4, 2007 to 
see the properties close to Schefferville (James, Knob Lake, Redmond and 
Houston) which would be considered as the source of "direct shipping" iron for 
the first six years of the proposed operations.  The existing infrastructure that 
would be available for the project would also be inspected. 

SNC-Lavalin reviewed a large amount of data (a list of the reviewed reports is 
shown in Section 21.0 References) which was developed by the previous owners 
of the properties, IOCC and Hollinger North Shore Exploration Inc.  The reviewed 
data also included the exploration carried out by LIM during 2005 and 2006.

3.0 Reliance on Other Experts (Item 5.0) 
This report has been prepared for Labrador Iron Mines Limited by SNC-Lavalin.  
The findings, conclusions and recommendations are solely based on the 
information provided by LIM that consisted of reports, sections and plans 
prepared by Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOCC) during 1954 to 1982, and 
reports prepared for other subsequent owners of the properties, as well as 
reports of exploration and sampling activities of LIM.  

SNC-Lavalin did not conduct any fieldwork or sampling or independently verify 
the legal titles to the properties.  The site was visited but because of snow cover, 
rock sampling could not be carried out.

5.0 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure, Physiography (Item 7.0) 

5.1 Accessibility 

The LIM properties are part of the western central part of the Labrador Trough 
iron range.  The mineral properties are located about 1,000 km northeast of 
Montreal and adjacent to or within 70 km of the town of Schefferville (Quebec).  
There are no roads connecting the area to southern Labrador or to Quebec.  
Access to the area is by rail from Sept-Îles to Schefferville or by air from Montreal 
and Sept-Îles. 

The James and Knob Lake properties are accessible by existing gravel roads 
and are located approximately 3 km southwest of the town of Schefferville.  The 
Redmond deposit is located approximately 5 km south of the James deposit and 
can be reached by existing gravel roads.  The Houston deposits are located 
approximately 18 km southeast of Schefferville and can also be reached by 
existing gravel roads.  The Howse and Kivivic deposits are respectively located 
approximately 21 km and 40 km to the northwest of the James deposit and can 
be reached by existing gravel roads developed during the former IOCC 
operations. The Astray and Sawyer Lake deposits, approximately 50-65 km 
southeast of Schefferville, do not currently have road access but can be reached 
by float plane or by helicopter. . Access to the James and Knob Lake deposits is 
possible all year road because they are located close to the road connecting 
Schefferville to the Menehek Dam. The other access roads are not maintained 
during winter. 

5.2 Climate 

The Schefferville area and vicinity have a sub-arctic continental taiga climate with 
very severe winters.  Daily average temperatures exceed 0°C for only 
five months a year.  Daily mean temperatures for Schefferville average -24.1°C 
and -22.6°C in January and February respectively.  Mean daily average 
temperatures in July and August are 12.4°C and 11.2°C, respectively.  Snowfall 
in November, December and January generally exceeds 50 cm per month and 
the wettest summer month is July with an average rainfall of 106.8 mm. 



 
  

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 5-2 Mining & Metallurgy 

5.3 Local Resources 

The economy of Schefferville is, since the closure of the mining operations of 
IOCC, based on hunting and fishing, tourism and public service administration. 
Several fishing and hunting camp operators are based in Schefferville.  

While there is a potential labor force in Schefferville and vicinity, training 
programs will be required.  It is assumed that government resources would be 
made available for such programs. 

5.4 Infrastructure 

The properties are located inside a 55 km radius from Schefferville. James, 
Houston, Knob Lake and Redmond are within 20 km and form the first group of 
properties from which mining by LIM would commence. Sawyer Lake and Astray 
Lake properties are some 50 to 65 km southeast from Schefferville and are cut 
off from the local infrastructure by connected lakes.  The Howse and Kivivic are 
some 25 and 45 km northwest from Schefferville. IOCC had excavation activities 
close to all properties other than Sawyer/Astray. 

Schefferville, Quebec is located in Innu territory at an approximate distance of 
2 km from Labrador on the north shore of Knob Lake.  The town was established 
by IOCC in 1954 to support mining operations in the area. There are 
222 residents in the Town of Schefferville, including 46 children, 85 women and 
91 men (France Pinot, personal communications with LIM, 2006).  The town of 
Schefferville has no mayor, but is run instead by an Administrator.  The First 
Nations residents in the immediate vicinity of Schefferville are members of the 
Matimekosh-Lac John Band Council.  The Town and Reserve are closely linked 
within the community, geographically separated by one street.  Very few 
residents in Schefferville are unemployed. 

There are no University or College graduates in the community and no trades' 
people in town.  When trade work is needed, individuals are hired from Sept-Îles 
or from the Naskapi Nation of Kawakachikamach. 

The Labrador Innu Nation also claim historic territorial rights to the area, as do 
the members of the Innu Nation of Takuaikan Uashat mak Mani-Utenam.

Schefferville Airport 

Schefferville Airport is owned by Transport Canada, and operated by the 
Schefferville Airport Corporation since March 1999.  

 Designated a Remote airport under the National Airports Policy. 

 Population served: Around 1,500 people regionally. 

 Total land area of 125 ha; includes the following facilities: 

• Air terminal building of 200 m2 built in 1971. 

• One runway 1500m X 45m (5000' X 150') asphalted.  

• Combined fire hall and maintenance garage of 1,130 m2. 

• Refueling operations.

• Scheduled flights. 

The Railway 

The Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway (QNS&L) was established by 
IOCC to haul iron ore from Schefferville area mines to Sept-Îles a distance of 
some 568 km starting in 1954.  After shipping some 150 million tons of iron ore 
from the area the operation was closed in 1982, although, as a common carrier, it 
maintained a passenger and freight service between Sept-Îles, Labrador City and 
Schefferville up to 2005.  In 2005 the IOCC sold a section of the railway (208 km) 
between Ross Bay Junction and Schefferville to Tshiuetin Rail Transportation 
Inc.(TRTI), owned by the Naskapi and two Innu Nations.  The mandate of TRTI is 
to maintain the passenger and light freight traffic between Sept-Îles and 
Schefferville. 

Three other railway companies operate in the area, Arnault Railways between 
Arnault Junction and Pointe Noire to haul iron ore for Wabush Mines (Wabush), 
Northern Lands Railway is jointly owned by IOCC and Wabush for hauling iron 
concentrates from Labrador City area to Ross Junction and CRC hauls iron 
concentrates from Fermont area to Port-Cartier for Quebec Cartier Mining 
Company.  The latter railway is not connected to Arnault, QNS&L or NLR. 



 
  

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 5-5 Mining & Metallurgy 

5.5 Physiography 

The average elevation of the properties varies from 500 m to 700 m above sea 
level.  Generally the area slopes gently from west to northeast away from the 
land representing the Québec-Labrador border and towards the Howells River 
valley parallel to the dip of the deposits.  The terrain is generally gently rolling to 
flat sloping north-westerly, with total relief of about 50 - 100 m.  However, a 
ground magnetic field survey of the Howse property describes a contrasting 
steep topography that covers the north slope of a hill just to the south of the 
property.  This hill locally rises approximately 350 m above the lakes elevation 
and bedrock is likely exposed in that area. 

The finger-shaped area of Labrador that encloses the Howells River valley drains 
southwards into the Hamilton River watershed and from there into the Atlantic 
Ocean.  Streams to the east and west of the height of land in Quebec, flow into 
the Kaniapiskau watershed, which flows north into Ungava Bay.

6.0 History (Item 8.0) 
The Quebec-Labrador iron range has a tradition of mining since the early 1950's 
and is one of the largest iron producing regions in the world.  The former direct 
shipping iron ore operations at Schefferville (Quebec and Labrador) operated by 
IOCC produced in excess of 150 million tons of lump and sinter fine ores over the 
period 1954-1982.  The properties comprising LIM's Schefferville area project 
were part of the original IOCC Schefferville operations and formed part of the 250 
million tons of reserves and resources identified by IOCC but were not part of 
IOCC's producing properties1. 

There are currently three major iron ore producers in the Labrador City-Wabush 
region to the south, i.e. IOCC, Quebec Cartier Mining Company and Wabush 
Mines, with a total annual production of more than 40 millions tonnes of iron 
concentrate and pellets per year.  Two or three major new iron ore projects in the 
Quebec-Labrador Peninsula are currently at the feasibility stage.  

The Labrador Trough which forms the central part of the Quebec-Labrador 
Peninsula, is a remote region which remained largely unexplored until the late 
1930's and early 1940's when the first serious mineral exploration was initiated 
by Hollinger North Shore Exploration Company Limited (Hollinger), and Labrador 
Mining and Exploration Mining Company Limited.  These companies were 
granted large mineral concessions in the Quebec and Labrador portions of the 
Trough.  Initially, the emphasis was on exploring for base and precious metals 
but, as the magnitude of the iron deposits in the area became apparent, 
development of these resources became the exclusive priority for a number of 
years. 

The first serious exploration in the Labrador Trough occurred in the late 1930's 
and early 1940's when Hollinger and Labrador Mining and Exploration Mining 
Company Limited acquired large mineral concessions in the Quebec and 
Labrador portions of the Trough.  Initially, the emphasis was on exploring for 
base and precious metals but, as the magnitude of the iron deposits in the area 
became apparent, development of these resources became the exclusive priority 
for a number of years. 

                                               

1 This is an historic estimate made in compliance with the standards used by IOCC described in Section 
17 of this report. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 6-2 Mining & Metallurgy 

Mining and shipping from the Hollinger lands began in 1954 under the 
management of the IOCC, a company specifically formed to exploit the 
Schefferville area iron deposits.  As the technology of the steel industry changed 
over the ensuing years more emphasis was placed on the concentrating ores of 
the Wabush area and interest and markets for the direct shipping Schefferville 
ores declined.  Finally, in 1982, the IOCC closed their operations in the 
Schefferville area.  From 1954 to 1982, a total of some 150 million tons of ore 
was produced from the area. 

In 1954, IOCC started to operate open pit mines in Schefferville containing 
56-58% Fe, and exported the direct-shipping product to steel companies in the 
United States and Western Europe.  The properties and iron deposits that 
currently form LIM's Labrador Project were part of the original IOCC Schefferville 
area operations and the reserves and resources identified at the James, 
Houston, Sawyer, Astray and Howse deposits were developed under the 
operations of IOCC during the time they operated their direct-shipping 
Schefferville iron operations. 

During the 1960's, higher-grade iron deposits were developed in Australia and 
South America and customers' preferences shifted to products containing 
+62% Fe or higher.  In 1963, IOCC developed the Carol Lake deposit near 
Labrador City and started to produce concentrates and pellets with +64% Fe, so 
as to satisfy the customers' requirements for higher-grade products.  High growth 
in the demand for steel, which began after the end of World War II, came to an 
abrupt end in the early 1980's due to the impact of increasing oil prices.  The 
energy crisis affected steel production in the U.S. and Western Europe as 
consumers switched to energy-efficient products.  As a result, the demand for 
iron ore plummeted, creating a severe overcapacity in the industry.  
Consequently, IOCC decided to close the Schefferville area mines in 1982.  

Hollinger, a subsidiary of Norcen Energy Ltd., was the underlying owner of the 
iron ore mining leases in Schefferville area of Quebec covering the IOCC 
operations.  Following the closure of the IOCC mining operations, ownership of 
the leases in Quebec reverted to Hollinger and the mining rights held by IOCC in 
Labrador reverted to the Crown.  In the early 1990's, Hollinger was acquired by 
La Fosse Platinum Group Inc. (La Fosse) who conducted feasibility studies on 
marketing, bulk sampling, metallurgical test work and carried out some stripping 
of overburden at the James deposit.  La Fosse sought and was granted a project 
release under the Environmental Assessment Act for the James deposit in 
June 1990 but did not go ahead with project development and the claims 
subsequently were permitted to lapse.

With the exception of the pre-stripping work carried out on the James deposit and 
the mining of the Redmond #1 orebody by IOCC (adjacent to LIM's current 
Redmond property), none of iron deposits within the LIM mineral claims were 
previously developed for production during the IOCC period of ownership. 

Between September 2003 and March 2006, Fenton and Graeme Scott, New 
Millennium Capital Corp. and Energold Minerals Inc. began staking claims over 
the soft iron ores in the Labrador part of the Schefferville camp.  Recognizing a 
need to consolidate the mineral ownership, Energold entered in to agreements 
with the various parties which have subsequently been assumed by LIM.

7.0 Geological Setting (Item 9.0) 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The following summarizes the general geological settings of the various 
properties making up the LIM's project.  The regional geological descriptions 
herein are based on published reports by Gross (1965), Zajac (1974), 
Wardel (1979) and Neale (2000). 

At least 45 hematite-goethite ore deposits have been discovered in an area 
20 km wide that extends 100 km northwest of Astray Lake, referred to as the 
Knob Lake Iron Range, which consists of tightly folded and faulted iron-formation 
exposed along the height of land that forms the boundary between Quebec and 
Labrador.  The iron deposits occur in deformed segments of iron-formation, and 
the ore content of single deposits varies from one million to more than 50 million 
tonnes. 

The Knob Lake properties are located on the western margin of the Labrador 
Trough adjacent to Archean basement gneisses.  The Labrador Trough 
otherwise known as the Labrador-Quebec Fold Belt extends for more than 
1,000 km along the eastern margin of the Superior craton from Ungava Bay to 
Lake Pletipi, Quebec.  The belt is about 100 km wide in its central part and 
narrows considerably to the north and south. 

The western half of the Labrador Trough, consisting of a thick sedimentary 
sequence, can be divided into three sections based on changes in lithology and 
metamorphism (North, Central and South).  The Trough is comprised of a 
sequence of Proterozoic sedimentary rocks including iron formation, volcanic 
rocks and mafic intrusions known as the Kaniapiskau Supergroup (Gross, 1968).  
The Kaniapiskau Supergroup consists of the Knob Lake Group in the western 
part of the Trough and the Doublet Group, which is primarily volcanic, in the 
eastern part. 

The Central or Knob Lake Range section extends for 550 km south from the 
Koksoak River to the Grenville Front located 30 km north of Wabush Lake.  The 
principal iron formation unit, the Sokoman Formation, part of the Knob Lake 
Group, forms a continuous stratigraphic unit that thickens and thins from sub-
basin to sub-basin throughout the fold belt. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 7-2 Mining & Metallurgy 

The southern part of the Trough is crossed by the Grenville Front.  Trough rocks 
in the Grenville Province to the south are highly metamorphosed and complexly 
folded.  Iron deposits in the Grenville part of the Labrador Trough include Lac 
Jeannine, Fire Lake, Mounts Wright and Reed and the Luce, Humphrey and 
Scully deposits in the Wabush area.  The high-grade metamorphism of the 
Grenville Province is responsible for recrystallization of both iron oxides and 
silica in primary iron formation producing coarse-grained sugary quartz, 
magnetite, specular hematite schists (meta-taconites) that are of improved 
quality for concentrating and processing. 

The main part of the Trough north of the Grenville Front is in the Churchill 
Province and has been subjected to low-grade (greenschist facies) 
metamorphism.  In areas west of Ungava Bay, metamorphism increases to lower 
amphibolite grade.  The mines developed in the Schefferville area by IOCC 
exploited residually enriched earthy iron deposits derived from taconite-type 
protores. 

Geological conditions throughout the central division of the Labrador Trough are 
generally similar to those in the Knob Lake Range. 

A general geological map of Labrador is shown in Figure 7-1.

7.2 Local Geology 

The general stratigraphy of the Knob Lake area is representative of most of the 
range, except that the Denault dolomite and Fleming Formation are not uniformly 
distributed.  The Knob Lake Range occupies an area 100 km long by 8 km wide.  
The sedimentary rocks including the cherty iron formation of this area are weakly 
metamorphosed to greenschist facies.  In the structurally complex areas, 
leaching and secondary enrichment have produced earthy textured iron deposits. 
Unaltered banded magnetite iron formation, often referred to as taconite, occurs 
as gently dipping beds west of Schefferville in the Howells River deposits. 

The sedimentary rocks in the Knob Lake Range strike northwest, and their 
corrugated surface appearance is due to parallel ridges of quartzite and iron 
formation which alternate with low valleys of shales and slates.  The Hudsonian 
Orogeny compressed the sediments into a series of synclines and anticlines, 
which are cut by steep angle reverse faults that dip primarily to the east.  The 
synclines are overturned to the southwest with the east limits commonly 
truncated by strike faults.   

Most of the secondary earthy textured iron deposits occur in canoe-shaped 
synclines; some are tabular bodies extending to a depth of at least 200 m, and 
one or two deposits are relatively flat lying and cut by several faults.  In the 
western part of the Knob Range, the iron formation dips gently eastward over the 
Archean basement rocks for about 10 km to the east, then forms an imbricate 
fault structure with bands of iron formation, repeated up to seven times. 

Subsequent supergene processes converted some of the iron formations into 
high-grade ores, preferentially in synclinal depressions and/or down-faulted 
blocks.  Original sedimentary textures are commonly preserved by selected 
leaching and replacement of the original deposits.  Jumbled breccias of enriched 
ore and altered iron formations, locally called rubble ores, are also present.  
Fossil trees and leaves of Cretaceous age have been found in rubble ores in 
some of the deposits (Neal, 2000).

7.3 Geology of Schefferville Area 

The stratigraphy of the Schefferville area is as follows: 

Attikamagen Formation – is exposed in folded and faulted segments of the 
stratigraphic succession where it varies in thickness from 30 metres near the 
western margin of the belt to more than 365 metres near Knob Lake.  The lower 
part of the formation has not been observed.  It consists of argillaceous material 
that is thinly bedded (2-3mm), fine grained (0.02 to 0.05mm), grayish green, dark 
grey to black, or reddish grey.  Calcareous or arenaceous lenses as much as 
30 cm in thickness occur locally interbedded with the argillite and slate, and 
lenses of chert are common.  The formation grades upwards into Denault 
dolomite, or into Wishart quartzite in area where dolomite is absent. Beds are 
intricately drag-folded, and cleavage is well developed parallel with axial planes, 
perpendicular to axial lines of folds and parallel with bedding planes. 

Denault Formation – is interbedded with the slates of the Attikamagen 
Formation at its base and grades upwards into the chert breccia or quartzite of 
the Fleming Formation.  The Denault Formation consists primarily of dolomite, 
which weathers buff-grey to brown.  Most of it occurs in fairly massive beds 
which vary in thickness from a few centimetres to about one metre, some of 
which are composed of aggregates of dolomite fragments. 

Near Knob Lake the formation probably has a maximum thickness of 180 metres 
but in many other places it forms discontinuous lenses that are, at most, 
30 metres thick.  Leached and altered beds near the iron deposits are rubbly, 
brown or cream colored and contain an abundance of chert or quartz fragments 
in a soft white siliceous matrix. 

Fleming Formation – occurs a few kilometres southwest of Knob Lake and only 
above dolomite beds of the Denault Formation.  It has a maximum thickness of 
about 100 metres and consists of rectangular fragments of chert and quartz 
within a matrix of fine chert.  In the lower part of the formation the matrix is 
dominantly dolomite grading upwards into chert and siliceous material. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 7-6 Mining & Metallurgy 

Wishart Formation – Quartzite and arkose of the Wishart Formation form one of 
the most persistent units in the Kaniapiskau Supergroup.  Thick beds of massive 
quartzite are composed of well-rounded fragments of glassy quartz and 10-30% 
rounded fragments of pink and grey feldspar, well cemented by quartz and minor 
amounts of hematite and other iron oxides.  Fresh surfaces of the rock are 
medium grey to pink or red.  The thickness of the beds varies from a few 
centimetres to about one metre but exposures of massive quartzite with no 
apparent bedding occur most frequently. 

Ruth Formation – Overlying the Wishart Formation is a black, grey-green or 
maroon ferruginous slate, 3 to 36 metres thick.  This thinly banded, fissile 
material contains lenses of black chert and various amounts of iron oxides.  It is 
composed of angular fragments of quartz with K-feldspar sparsely distributed 
through a very fine mass of chlorite, white mica, iron oxides and abundant finely 
disseminated carbon and opaque material. Much of the slate contains more than 
20% iron. 

Sokoman Formation – More than 80% of the ore in the Knob Lake Range 
occurs within this formation.  Lithologically the iron formation varies in detail in 
different parts of the range and the thickness of individual members is not 
consistent. 

A thinly bedded, slaty facies at the base of the formation consists largely of fine 
chert with an abundance of iron silicates and disseminated magnetite and 
siderite.  Fresh surfaces are grey to olive green and weathered surfaces 
brownish yellow to bright orange where minnesotaite is abundant.  

Thin-banded oxide facies of iron formation occurs above the silicate-carbonate 
facies in nearly all parts of the area.  The jasper bands, which are 1.25 cm or less 
wide and deep red, or in a few places greenish yellow to grey, are interbanded 
with hard, blue layers of fine-grained hematite and a little magnetite. 

The thin jasper beds grade upwards into thick massive beds of grey to pinkish 
chert and beds that are very rich in blue and black iron oxides.  These massive 
beds are commonly referred to as "cherty metallic" iron formation and make up 
most of the Sokoman Formation.  The iron oxides are usually concentrated in 
layers a few centimetres thick interbedded with leaner cherty beds. In many 
places iron-rich layers and lenses contain more than 50% hematite and 
magnetite. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 7-7 Mining & Metallurgy 

The upper part of the Sokoman Formation comprises beds of dull green to grey 
or black massive chert that contains considerable siderite or other ferruginous 
carbonate.  Bedding is discontinuous and the rock as a whole contains much less 
iron than the lower part of the formation. 

Menihek Formation – A thin-banded, fissile, grey to black argillaceous slate 
conformably overlies the Sokoman Formation in the Knob Lake area.  Total 
thickness is not known, as the slate is only found in faulted blocks in the main ore 
zone.  East or south of Knob Lake, the Menihek Formation is more than 
300 metres thick but tight folding and lack of exposure prevent determination of 
its true thickness. 

The Menihek slate is mostly dark grey or jet black.  It has a dull sooty 
appearance but weathers light grey or becomes buff colored where leached. 
Bedding is less distinct than in the slates of other slate formations but thin 
laminae or beds are visible in thin sections.

8.0 Deposit Types (Item 10) 
The Labrador Trough contains four main types of iron deposits: 

 Soft iron ores formed by supergene leaching and enrichment of the 
weakly metamorphosed cherty iron formation; they are composed mainly 
of friable fine-grained secondary iron oxides (hematite, goethite, limonite). 

 Taconites, the fine-grained, weakly metamorphosed iron formations with 
above average magnetite content and which are also commonly called 
magnetite iron formation. 

 More intensely metamorphosed, coarser-grained iron formations, termed 
metataconites which contain specular hematite and subordinate amounts 
of magnetite as the dominant iron minerals. 

 Minor occurrences of hard high-grade hematite ore occur southeast of 
Schefferville at Swayer Lake, Astray Lake and in some of the Houston 
deposits. 

The Labrador Iron Mountain deposits are composed of iron formations of the 
Lake Superior-type.  The Lake Superior-type iron formation consists of banded 
sedimentary rocks composed principally of bands of iron oxides, magnetite and 
hematite within quartz (chert)-rich rock, with variable amounts of silicate, 
carbonate and sulphide lithofacies.  Such iron formations have been the principal 
sources of iron throughout the world. 

The Sokoman iron formation was formed as a chemical sediment under varied 
conditions of oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) and hydrogen ion 
concentrations (pH) in varied depth of seawater.  The resulting irregularly 
bedded, jasper-bearing, granular, oolite and locally conglomeratic sediments are 
typical of the predominant oxide facies of the Superior-type iron formations, and 
the Labrador Trough is the largest example of this type. 

The facies changes consist commonly of carbonate, silicate and oxide facies.  
Typical sulphide facies are poorly developed.  The mineralogy of the rocks is 
related to the change in facies during deposition, which reflects changes from 
shallow to deep-water environments of sedimentation.  In general, the oxide 
facies are irregularly bedded, and locally conglomeratic, having formed in 
oxidizing shallow-water conditions.  Most carbonate facies show deep-water 
features, except for the presence of minor amounts of granules.  The silicate 
facies are present in between the oxide and carbonate facies, with some textural 
features indicating deep-water formation.  



 

 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 8-2 Mining & Metallurgy 

Each facies contains typical primary minerals, ranging from siderite, 
minnesotaite, and magnetite-hematite in the carbonate, silicate and oxide facies, 
respectively.  The most common mineral in the Sokoman Formation is chert, 
which is closely associated with all facies, although it occurs in minor quantities 
with the silicate facies.  Carbonate and silicate lithofacies are present in varying 
amounts in the oxide members. 

The sediments of the Labrador Trough were initially deposited in a stable basin 
which was subsequently modified by penecontemporaneous tectonic and 
volcanic activity.  Deposition of the iron formation indicates intraformational 
erosion, redistribution of sediments, and local contamination by volcanic and 
related clastic material derived from the volcanic centers in the Dyke-Astray area. 

The consolidation of the sediments into cherty banded iron formation is due to 
diagenesis and low grade metamorphism which only reached the greenschist 
rank.  The iron may be a product of erosion.  It is unlikely that the Nimish 
volcanism made a significant contribution. 

The deposits that form part of the LIM project are: 

 James Deposit. 

 Knob Lake Deposit. 

 Houston Deposits. 

 Redmond Deposit. 

 Astray Lake Deposit. 

 Sawyer Lake Deposit. 

 Howse and Kivivic Deposits. 

8.1 James Deposit 

The James deposit is a northeast dipping elongated iron deposit with a direction 
of N330° in its main axis and it appears to be structurally and stratigraphically 
controlled.  The stratigraphic units recorded in James area go from the Denault 
Formation to the Menihek Formation.  The main volume of the mineralization is 
developed in the Middle Iron Formation (MIF) and lower portion of the Upper Iron 
Formation (UIF) both part of the Sokoman Formation. 



 

 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 8-3 Mining & Metallurgy 

The iron mineralization in the James deposit consist of thin layers (<10cms thick) 
of fine to medium grained steel blue hematite intercalated with minor cherty silica 
bands <5cms thick dipping 30° to 45° to the northeast.  The James mine 
mineralization has been affected by strong alteration which removed most of the 
cementing silica giving it a sandy friable texture. 

A typical section developed by IOCC is shown in Figure 8-1.

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 8-4 Mining & Metallurgy 

8.2 Knob Lake Deposit 

The Knob Lake No.1 deposit is a northeast dipping ellipsoidal iron deposit with a 
direction of N330° in its main axis and it appears to be structurally and 
stratigraphically controlled.  Despite the proximity of Knob lake deposit to James 
deposit, the mineralization in Knob Lake is different.  The deposit at Knob Lake is 
capped by a medium grade very hard siliceous hematite mineralization dipping 
35° - 45° to the northeast.  The high grade iron mineralization is concentrated at 
the end of a hill restricted between Knob and Lejuene Lakes which consists of 
thin banded hematite intercalated with layers of cherty silica <10cms thick.  The 
overall texture of the underlying mineralization is softer and moderately 
unconsolidated, similar to that in Houston deposit.  A single composite sample of 
this mineralization returned 60% Fe and 2% SiO2. 

8.3 Houston Deposit 

The Houston deposit comprises three separate bodies that are referred to as 
Houston 1, Houston 2S and Houston 3 deposits. Iron mineralization of potential 
direct shipping quality extends NW-SE for 5 kilometres by 150 metres in its wider 
zone.  The Houston deposit is stratigraphically and structurally controlled and 
consists of hard and friable banded blue and red hematite that locally becomes 
massive.  The air magnetic survey data suggest that the iron mineralization is 
concentrated along the west flank of a modest to strong magnetic feature which 
trends approximately N330°E.  Houston 1 and Houston 2S are not coincident 
with the strong magnetic feature due to the poor magnetic susceptibility of this 
type of mineralization which was confirmed in testing of hand specimens. 

8.4 Redmond Deposit 

The Redmond deposits are developed along a northwest trending synclinal that 
extends to the south to the Redmond No.1 deposit and to the north to the 
Wishart mine.  The Redmond deposits enclosed in license 011201M are small 
rounded medium Fe grade mineralized bodies. 

8.5 Astray Lake Deposit 

The Astray Lake deposit is a northeast dipping undefined iron deposit located 
approximately 500m northeast from the eastern shore of Astray Lake and on the 
west side of a steeply sided NW-SE trending ridge. The deposit occurs in iron 
formation in the south corner of the Petisikapau Synclinorium, a major structural 
feature of this part of the Labrador Trough. 



 

 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 8-5 Mining & Metallurgy 

The deposit is localized in the Lower Sokoman Formation in the trough of a major 
north-plunging syncline. The surface outline of the deposit has a northwest-
southeast alignment consistent with the distribution of the iron formation 
generally located along the ridges. Some of the hematite jasper iron formation is 
brecciated and ore is developed where hard blue hematite cements this breccia 
or replaces silica in the banded iron formation. Ore is developed up to the top of 
this member along the contact with the overlying basalt flows.  

The jasper iron formation is not highly metamorphosed and contains more than 
40% Fe in the form of hard dense blue to dark grey-black hematite distributed in 
fine granular textured layers inter-banded with deep red jasper. The iron 
formation has been highly leached and secondarily enriched in martite, goethite 
and hematite (Wardle, 1979). 

Due to the hard nature of the mineralized iron formation and its differential 
erosion with respect to other rock units, iron ore mineralization tends to be on or 
about the hilltops. Consequently it is believed that the Astray Lake mineralization 
will favor a significant amount of lump ore compared to the other "soft ore" 
deposits. The local stratigraphic units are dipping approximately between 30° and 
40° to the northeast. Taking into consideration the previous characteristics, the 
most prospective areas for iron mineralization are the eastern hillsides along the 
Astray Lake mountain, which was confirmed by the mineral occurrences 
identified so far. 

A typical geological cross section copied from the LIM report (Astray Lake Iron 
Ore Deposit.  Description and Recommendations.  Erick Chavez. Labrador Iron 
Mines Ltd.  August 2006), is shown in Figure 8-2.

8.6 Sawyer Lake Deposit 

The Sawyer Lake deposit is a medium-sized iron deposit located approximately 
1.6 km northwest of Sawyer Lake. The deposit occurs in iron formation in the 
south corner of the Petisikapau Synclinorium. The southern limb of this structure 
strikes northeast and is deformed in a series of tight folds that plunge northwest 
(Gross, 1968). 

The deposit is localized in the Lower Sokoman Formation in the trough of a major 
north-plunging syncline. Deformed beds in the trough of this fold dip from 45

0 E to 
vertical and form a small north-plunging anticline. The surface outline of the 
deposit is irregular and is generally discordant with the highly contorted banding 
of the fold. Cross-sections outlining the ore mass, however, show that it has an 
inverted "V" shape or saddle reef-like structure, suggesting that hematite 
enrichment followed bedding over the crest of the small anticline. Some of the 
hematite jasper iron formation is brecciated and ore is developed where hard 
blue hematite cements this breccia or replaces silica in the banded iron 
formation. The jasper iron formation is not highly metamorphosed and contains 
more than 40% Fe in the form of dark grey blue hematite distributed in fine 
granular textured layers inter-banded with deep red jasper. The ore appears 
massive and consists of dark grey-blue hard microcrystalline hematite with minor 
amounts of silica (2%) as an impurity. 

The Sawyer Lake iron deposit does not fit the two most common models for iron 
formation in the Labrador Trough. It differs from the Knob Lake deposits in that 
the ore is very hard dense blue hematite with practically no goethite present and 
like Astray Lake, is therefore expected to produce a greater quantity of lump ore 
than the other "soft ore" deposits. 

8.7 Howse and Kivivic Deposits 

The geological database for the Howse and Kivivic deposits is more limited than 
for the other deposits. Howse was one of the last deposits to be discovered by 
IOCC. The studies have shown that IOCC drilled some 110 reverse circulation 
drill holes on the Howse deposit but the results of these drilling programs have 
not yet been investigated. The property is located under a thick layer of 
overburden (~ 10 - 20 metres) that makes surface exploration very difficult. A 
ground magnetic survey was carried out in 2005 and inferred a fault. Some 
prospecting and grab sampling has been done by LIM. Further details of 
analytical results and geology of either, Howse and Kivivic deposits, remain 
unknown. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 8-8 Mining & Metallurgy 

It is contemplated that Howse and Kivivic will be developed in the second or third 
phases of mine development due to their distance from existing infrastructure, 
although both are accessible by the existing road network.

9.0 Mineralization (Item 11.0) 
The earthy bedded iron deposits are a residually enriched type within the 
Sokoman iron formation that formed after two periods of intense folding and 
faulting, followed by the circulation of meteoric waters in the fractured rocks. The 
enrichment process was caused largely by leaching and the loss of silica, 
resulting in a strong increase in porosity. This produced a friable, granular and 
earthy-textured iron ore. The siderite and silica minerals were altered to hydrated 
oxides of goethite and limonite. The second stage of enrichment included the 
addition of secondary iron and manganese which appear to have moved in 
solution and filled pore spaces with limonite-goethite. Secondary manganese 
minerals, i.e., pyrolusite and manganite, form veinlets and vuggy pockets. The 
types of iron ores developed in the deposits are directly related to the original 
mineral facies. The predominant blue granular ore was formed from the oxide 
facies of the middle iron formation. The yellowish-brown ore, composed of 
limonite-goethite, formed from the carbonate-silicate facies, and the red painty 
hematite ore originated from mixed facies in the argillaceous slaty members. The 
overall ratio of blue to yellow to red ore is approximately 70:15:15. The proportion 
of each varies widely within the deposits.  

Only the direct shipping ore is considered beneficiable to produce lumps and 
sinter feed and will be part of the resources for the LIM project. The direct 
shipping ore was classified by IOCC in six categories based on their chemical, 
mineralogical and textural compositions. This classification is still used in the 
evaluation of the mineralization. The following six ore categories and two other 
mineralization categories not part of the potential economic mineralization, are: 

 High Non-Bessemer (HNB) red, yellow and blue. 

 Lean Non Bessemer (LNB) red, yellow and blue. 

 High Silica (HiSiO2)  (waste). 

 Treat Rock (TRX) (waste but previously stockpiled for 
possible later treatment). 

The blue ores, which are composed mainly of the minerals hematite and martite, 
are generally coarse grained and friable. They are usually found in the middle 
section of the iron formation. 

The yellow ores, which are made up of the minerals limonite and goethite, are 
located in the lower section of the iron formation. These ores have the 
unfavorable characteristic of retaining high moisture content. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 9-2 Mining & Metallurgy 

The red ore is predominantly a red earthy hematite. It forms the basal layer that 
underlies the lower section of the iron formation. Red ore is characterized by its 
clay and slate-like texture.  

Direct shipping ores and lean ores mined in the Schefferville area during the 
period 1954-1982 amounted to some 150 million tons. Based on the original ore 
definition of IOCC (+50% Fe <18% SiO2 dry basis), approximately 200 million 
tonnes of iron resources remain in the Schefferville area, exclusive of magnetite 
taconite. LIM has acquired rights to approximately 50% of this remaining iron 
resource.2. 

 

                                               

2 These numbers are based on historic estimates made in compliance with the standards used by IOCC 
described in Section 17 of this report.

10.0 Exploration (Item 12.0) 

10.1 Past and Recent Exploration 

Most exploration on the properties was carried out by IOCC until the closure of 
their operation in 1982. Most data used in the evaluation of the current status of 
the resource and reserve evaluation is provided in the documents, sections and 
maps produced by IOCC or by consultants working for them. The recent program 
of exploration was carried out by LIM during 2005 and 2006. The results of the 
drilling program carried out by LIM are shown in Section 11.0. 

A short program of bulk sampling was carried out in 2006 as well. Bulk sampling 
was completed in two stages. The first stage consisted of trenching and sampling 
mineralization from the Houston 1 deposit, the second stage consisted of 
trenching and sampling mineralization from the James deposit. 

The location of the trench and the results of the Houston 1 deposit sampling are

10.2 Ongoing Exploration 

Ongoing exploration on LIM's properties in the Schefferville area will essentially 
focus at two or three different levels depending upon the proposed development 
schedule for the particular deposit.  

At the James and Houston deposits that are currently at the most advanced 
stage, additional verification reverse circulation drilling will be required to enable 
the classification of mineable reserves and resources to be compliant with 
NI 43-101.  In addition, further bulk sampling for metallurgical testing is necessary 
prior to adoption of the final process flow sheet.  

At Houston, the long and sinuous southern extension to the mineralized zone 
may also be investigated by a program of trenching and verification reverse 
circulation drilling.  

The nearby deposits at Redmond and Knob Lake will require also verification 
reverse circulation drilling to establish and/or verify any existing resource 
estimates for mineable reserves as well as bulk sampling for metallurgical test 
work. 

It is proposed that the Howse and Kivivic deposits be initially investigated by 
detailed gravity surveys as a means of evaluating the high grade ore deposits. 
Eventually diamond and reverse circulation drilling programs will be necessary to 
verify and upgrade the IOCC resources estimates to mineable reserves.  



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 10-4 Mining & Metallurgy 

Detailed gravity and magnetometer surveys may be helpful at Astray Lake and 
Sawyer Lake to evaluate possible extensions of the known deposits. A 
combination of trenching and reverse circulation drilling will be necessary to 
evaluate and classify the existing resource estimates and for eventual upgrade to 
a mineable reserve. Trenching programs will be necessary for preliminary 
metallurgical test work. 

 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 11-1 Mining & Metallurgy 

11.0 Drilling (Item 13.0) 
Diamond drilling of the Schefferville iron deposits has been a problem historically 
in that the alternating hard and soft ore zones tend to preclude good core 
recovery. Traditionally IOCC used a combination of reverse circulation drilling, 
diamond drilling and trenching to generate data for reserve and resource 
calculation. 

A large number of original IOCC data have been recovered and reviewed by LIM. 
For the most recent calculations of the resources for the James Mine deposit, 
data of 105 reverse circulation drill holes has been used. The systematic drilling 
has been carried out on sections 100 feet (30 metres) apart.  Further details are 
shown in Section 17.0 of this report.  An additional 16 holes which appeared to be 
older were drilled probably to outline the limits of the mineralization. A large 
number of trenches have been sampled. 

The IOCC drilling information on the Houston deposit, shown as three separate 
deposits: Houston-1, Houston-2S and Houston-3, consists of some 41 holes on 
Houston-1, 2 holes on Houston-2S and 1 hole on Houston-3. Information on 
3 drill holes drilled on the Astray Lake deposits have been recovered at this time. 
Further research and interpretation by LIM of the historical data of IOCC 
continues. 

LIM carried out a program of diamond drilling between July 21st and August 26th 
of 2006 on the James, Knob Lake No.1, Houston and Astray Lake deposits using 
Cartwright Drilling Inc. of Goose Bay. A total of 605 metres in 11 holes were 
completed.  

LIM's drilling program was limited to diamond drilling because of the necessity of 
helicopter support for the summer-time drilling at Astray Lake. As predicted, the 
blocky nature of the iron formations and/or the "sandy" nature of the softer ore 
zones resulted in the loss of return water which prevented full core recovery 
being obtained and in most cases, prevented the hole from being drilled to the 
desired target depths. 

In order to improve core recovery, drilling had to include the use of bentonite and 
G-Stop in combination with bits of face discharge (FD) or face injection 
configuration. The use of the face discharge bits significantly improved the core 
recovery in soft blocky ore zones by not allowing the water into the inner tube 
that would wash the core. Despite the better recovery using FD bits, they did not 
work efficiently with fine grained sandy ore.

12.0 Sampling Method and Approach (Item 14.0) 
During the time that IOCC operated in the area, sampling of the exploration 
targets were by trenches and test pits as well as by drilling.  In the test pits and 
trenches geological mapping determined the lithologies and the samples were 
taken over 10 feet (= 3.0 metres). The results were plotted on vertical cross 
sections. 

The first exploration phase by LIM consisted of trench sampling of the James 
deposit and the Houston deposit (see Section 10 of this report) and a short 
diamond drilling program on the James deposit (two twin holes with old IOCC 
holes), on the Houston deposit 4 holes (also twin holes with old IOCC drilling), on 
the Knob Lake deposit one hole (a twin hole with an old unidentified drill hole) 
and on the Astray Lake deposit 3 holes. More details are shown in Section 11 of 
this report. 

Sampling of core was carried out in 1.5 m sections. Individual samples were 
confined to no more than one lithological type, in which case shorter samples of 
not less than 0.6 m and/or longer samples of not more than 2.1 m were taken. 
Samples were split using a conventional manual core splitter. Half of the core 
was bagged and labeled.  Due to the strongly broken nature of most of the core, 
splitting core was not always necessary, in this case small pieces of core were 
hand picked making sure of homogeneously selecting half of the core. 

Samples from the Houston trenching are 5 metres in length and were collected 
using a rock hammer. Samples consisted of a mixture of soft sandy ore (over 
60% of sample) and broken fragments were rarely bigger than 12.7 cm. The 
sampling was undertaken as a verification of results obtained by IOCC. 

Sample bags containing core and trench samples were place in 5-gallon plastic 
pails for protection and transportation to the laboratory. Samples collected from 
drill core and trenching were shipped to ALS Chemex Labs in Sudbury, Ontario 
using ALS Chemex code ME-ICP87 for iron ore assay and analyses. Following 
sample preparation, sample aliquots were sent by ALS Chemex to their 
laboratory in Brisbane, Australia for verification assaying.  

 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 13-1 Mining & Metallurgy 

13.0 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security (Item 15.0) 
All drilling and sampling of the iron deposits covered in this study has been done 
by IOCC during the time that they owned and produced direct shipping iron ore 
from adjacent and nearby properties (from 1954 to 1982), with the exception of a 
short drilling campaign (11 holes) carried out by LIM in 2006.  The trench 
sampling and geological interpretation of the zones was also performed by IOCC, 
again with the exception of a short sampling program in 1989 (for Hollinger) and 
recently, in 2006, by LIM. The sample preparation, analysis and security in place 
during the operations of IOCC is not specifically known but it can be assumed 
that it was done following acceptable industry practice and the standards for an 
experienced mining company at that time. 

It is proposed that during the confirmation exploration program reverse circulation 
drilling and trench bulk sampling will be carried out using current industry best 
practise that will be witnessed and described in the feasibility study. 

 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 14-1 Mining & Metallurgy 

14.0 Data Verification (Item 16.0) 
The majority of data used in the current review is derived from historic data of 
IOCC (documents recovered from IOCC files and from plans and sections on 
which the geology and assay results have been plotted). The reserve and 
resource estimates contained therein are non-compliant with NI 43-101.  As an 
example of the original IOCC data some of the original plans and sections have 
been scanned, to make them reproducible as illustrations for this report see 
Section 24.0 Illustrations (Item 26).  This geological and assay data will be used 
to guide the proposed confirmation exploration by reverse circulation drilling and 
bulk sampling from trenches, to verify the assay data on the sections from the 
IOCC files.  

A preliminary, non-compliant with NI 43-101, resource estimate has been made 
for the James deposit and is described in Section 17.0 Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves Estimates (Item 19.0). Detailed verification of data for all 
deposits will be carried out after the confirmation exploration program of reverse 
circulation drilling and trench bulk sampling has been completed. 

The program of exploration and data verification recommended in this report will 
enable verification of the historic data.

15.0 Adjacent Properties (Item 17.0) 
Adjacent to the properties owned by LIM in Labrador are other former operations 
of IOCC in Labrador and Quebec that were either mined out or abandoned by 
IOCC in 1982. IOCC produced an approximate total of some 150,000,000 tons of 
direct shipping iron ore from all their properties in Quebec and Labrador during 
the operating years of 1954 to 1982.  IOCC is currently operating the Carol Lake 
iron property some 200 km south of Schefferville near Labrador City in Labrador. 

The previously owned IOCC operations in Quebec have reverted to the 
ownership of Hollinger, while New Millennium owns some of the properties in 
Labrador. 

A feasibility study is currently being carried out for an iron deposit in the Howells 
River area of Labrador known as the LabMag Property located some 30 km 
northwest of Schefferville. The property is owned by the partnership of 
New Millennium Capital Corp. and the Naskapi LabMag Trust. 

A feasibility study for the Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines for their Bloom 
Lake Deposit has recently been completed for a 7 Mtpa iron operation east of the 
Québec Cartier operation of Mont-Wright , near Labrador City.

16.0 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing (Item 
18.0) 

16.1 Lakefield Research Laboratories 

During February 1989 three mineralized samples comprising approximately 
12.7 tonnes or 45 drums of James ore were treated at Lakefield Research 
Laboratories (now SGS-Lakefield), Lakefield, Ontario.  This test work program 
was supervised by W. R. Hatch Engineering Ltd. of Ontario, and the results were 
detailed in the report entitled "Wet Spiral Classification of Iron Ores" for LaFosse 
Platinum Group Inc., dated March 6 1989. Descriptions of the test samples are 
not available, however, the average head grade of 62.1% Fe and 10.1% silica 
was about 3.5 units higher in iron and 0.9 units lower in silica than the IOCC 
estimated average in the James deposit.  

The samples were crushed to 100% -1½ inches (in) and screened at ½ in. The 
Lump Ore product (-1½ in to ½ in) was weighted and assayed and the -½ in 
wash feed was weighed and fed at a controlled rate to a washing circuit. The 
washing process included a rotary scrubber (mill without grinding media) and a 
spiral classifier. The spiral classifier fines overflow and sands products were 
collected and analyzed. The Lakefield test results are summarized in Table 16-1.

The washing results were used to evaluate James deposit mineralization as part 
of the open pit evaluation. The washing results provided an indication of the 
Lump, Fines and Tailings products quality. Plotting the feed iron and silica grade 
relationship of the three samples on scatter diagram established from the IOCC 
sample population, all test sample points were above the trend line which 
indicates a type of mineralization containing high iron and low silica. When 
comparing the test samples to the block model data, it becomes apparent that it 
would be desirable to test representative samples containing lower iron grades 
so that the up-grading potential can be assessed. Hatch Engineering Ltd 
concluded that at low silica content (68% iron and 2.3% silica) only minor 
upgrading occurred. For the relatively high silica samples (57.7% to 59.7% Fe 
and 15.6% to 14.0% silica), silica concentrated into fines overflow (tailings), 
resulting in upgrading the sands fraction with respect to iron. 

16.2 Midrex Tests 

Midrex Technologies, Inc. (Midrex) is an international iron and steel making 
technology company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1989 Midrex sampled 
and tested lump ore samples # 632 from James, #620 from Sawyer Lake deposit 
and #625 from Houston 1 deposit for standard raw material evaluation purposes. 
The sample analyses are presented in Table 16-2.

16.3 Centre de Recherches Minérales (1990) 

In 1990, a bulk sample of mineralized material from the James deposit weighing 
approximately three tonnes was transported to Centre de Recherches Minerales 
(CdRM), Quebec City, for testing, on behalf of La Fosse Platinum Group Inc. This 
material was crushed to -1 in, which was finer than the Lakefield tests, and wet 
screened at ¼ in. The results from the screen tests on this bulk sample are 
summarized in Table 16-3.

16.4 2006 Bulk sampling by LIM 

Bulk samples from trenches at the James and Houston deposits were collected 
during the summer of 2006 from two trenches 113 metres and 78 metres long 
respectively. Three bulk samples of some 400 kg each were collected from the 
James trench and four bulk samples of some 600 kg each were collected from 
the Houston deposit trench for testing. (For the location of the trenches see 
Figures 10-1 and 10-2)  The testing for compressive strength, crusher index and 
abrasion index were done at SGS Lakefield. The composite crushing, dry and 
wet screen analysis, washing and classification tests were done at "rpc – The 
Technical Solutions Centre" in Fredericton, New Brunswick. An additional five 
composite samples from the different ore zones in the trench were collected and 
tested in the ALS Chemex Lab in Sudbury for chemical testing.  

The bulk sampling tests produced data for rock hardness and work indices for 
crushing and grinding, average density data for the various ore zones as well as 
chemical data. The specific density tests have shown that there is a possibility 
that the average SG is higher than the 3.5 kg/t which was used in the IOCC 
calculations. Additional bulk sample testing will be carried out during the 
confirmation exploration program. The SG data will be used in the calculations of 
the resource and reserve volumes while the chemical test results will be used to 
compare them with the historical IOCC data from neighboring drill holes. 
Table 16-5 show the summary of the results of the tests of the composite 
samples for the various ore types.

17.0 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Estimates 
(Item 19.0) 

17.1 Summary 

The mineral resources shown in this report are not yet compliant with the NI 43-
101. They are predominantly based on estimates made by IOCC in 1982 and 
published in their Direct-Shipping Ore (DSO) Reserve Book published in 1983. 
IOCC categorized their estimates as "reserves".  SNC has adopted the principle 
that these should be categorized at "resources" as defined by NI 43-101. These 
estimates were part of a review carried out by Kilborn Inc. (at that time an 
independent engineering company with the head office in Toronto) in 1995 for 
Hollinger. The same properties were again evaluated for SOQUEM Inc. (a mining 
company owned by the government of Quebec) by experts of Metchem (an 
independent engineering company from Montreal) in 2002. All estimates were 
based on geological interpretations on cross sections and the calculations were 
done manually. A recent computerized estimate for LIM, was prepared in 2006 by 
Wardrop Engineering Inc. for the James deposit using the data shown on vertical 
cross sections prepared by IOCC for their reserve calculations.  

All resource estimates quoted in this section of the report are based on prior data 
and reports prepared by IOCC, the previous operator. These historical estimates 
are not current and do not meet NI 43-101 definition standards and are reported 
here for historical purposes only. A qualified person has not done sufficient work 
to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources. The historical 
estimates should not be relied upon. These historical results provide an 
indication of the potential of the properties and are relevant to ongoing 
exploration.  

The historic IOCC ore reserves classifications used in the reports are not 
compliant with reserves classifications compliant with NI 43-101 The historic 
reserves were for DSO which was ore that was sold directly to the customer in its 
raw state. The only processing done was the crushing to 4-inch size in the mine 
screening plant and, in case of wet ore, reduction of moisture content in the 
drying plant in Sept-Îles. It should be noted that the following estimates are based 
on economics of 1983 and that although the geological, mineralogical and 
processing data will be the same today, economics and market conditions will 
have changed. The classification used in the IOCC reports are as follows: 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 17-2 Mining & Metallurgy 

 Measured: The ore is measured accurately in three dimensions. All 
development and engineering evaluations (economics, ore testing) are 
complete. The deposit is physically accessible and has a complete pit 
design. The reserve is economic and is marketable under current 
conditions. 

 Indicated: Development and engineering evaluations (economics, ore 
testing) are complete. Deposits in this category do not meet all the criteria 
of measured ore. 

 Inferred: Only preliminary development and evaluation are completed. 
Deposits may not be mineable because of location, engineering 
considerations, economics and quality. 

 

The above shown terms, definitions and classification are not compliant with NI 
43-101 but were used by IOCC for their production reports. Current compliant 
mineral resources are categorized on the basis of the degree of confidence in the 
estimate of quantity and grade or quality of the deposit, as follows: 

 Inferred mineral resources,  

 Indicated mineral resources and  

 Measured mineral resources. 

Compliant mineral reserves are that part of a measured mineral resource or 
indicated mineral resource which can be extracted legally and at a profit under 
economic conditions that are specified and generally accepted as reasonable by 
the mining industry and which is demonstrated by a preliminary feasibility study 
or feasibility study as follows: 

 Probable mineral reserve and  

 Proven mineral reserve 

There is no reason to conclude that IOCC utilized other than best industry 
practices. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that such historic resources can 
be easily brought to compliance with NI 43-101 requirements with a program of 
verification as recommended herein. The first step for this study is the 
confirmation of the resources for the properties and to make the resource 
estimates NI 43-101 compliant.

IOCC reports described above which meanings are not the same as those 
prescribed under NI 43-101. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 17-5 Mining & Metallurgy 

Note:7 The grade of IOCC's direct shipping iron ore operations in Schefferville were 
historically reported to have been between 56-58% Fe.  It is expected, based on 
historic operations and as reported in IOCC records, that the grade of LIM's 
deposits will be in a similar range.  It is not possible to give precise grades for each 
of the deposits until the resources have been verified and brought into compliance 
under NI 43-101. 

In 1995 Kilborn Inc. (at that time an independent engineering company with the 
head office in Toronto) carried out a project Development Plan study for Hollinger 
North Shore Exploration Inc.  The historic reserve estimates of IOCC, prepared in 
1982, for the Labrador and Quebec properties were reviewed.  The processing 
estimates were based on metallurgical test work carried out by Lakefield in 1988 
and 1989.  Kilborn did not produce a NI 43-101 qualified resource statement. 

In 2002, SOQUEM contracted Metchem to prepare an assessment of the 
Hollinger Iron Ore Development Project.  The historic reserve estimates prepared 
by IOCC in 1982, for the Labrador and Quebec properties were again reviewed.  
According to the Hollinger report the process test results of the Lakefield studies 
(see above) could not be validated because of the limited amount of testing and 
because only one deposit was sampled using some grab samples.  In the 
Metchem study the estimated resources were reduced by some 25% to allow for 
the exclusion of the "yellow" ore that would retain moisture and would not be 
processed.  Metchem did not produce a NI 43-101 qualified resource statement. 

In July 2006, Wardrop Engineering (Wardrop) conducted a preliminary resource 
model estimate on the James deposit for LIM. The estimation was based on 
historical geology interpretation on vertical sections by IOCC.  Drill hole 
information such as lithologies and assays for Iron, Silica, Manganese, 
Aluminium oxide, Phosphorous and Loss On Ignition (LOI) were available on 
these vertical sections. LIM compiled this information in an Access database 
from the vertical sections. Wardrop was provided with hard copies of vertical 
sections and the Access database, Excel spreadsheets and Mapinfo drawings of 
the property. Wardrop could not classify the resource because it would not be 
compliant with NI 43-101. The reported resource was considered indicative of 
potential for the property.   



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 17-6 Mining & Metallurgy 

17.2 James Property 

All estimates shown in Table 17-1 of the resources for the James deposit have 
been calculated with the data developed by IOCC during their exploration of the 
property. The strike length of the James deposit is some 1000 metres and two 
ore zones have been recognized named the Northern Ore Body and the 
Southern Ore Body. The zones have been drilled with 121 (reverse circulation 
and diamond) drill holes. The drilling and structural mapping was done on 
sections 100 feet (30 metres) apart and the information of some 69 sections have 
been recovered by LIM from the IOCC files. The difference in ore volumes from 
the various estimates are caused by a different interpretation of the results and 
some variations in assumptions regarding the amount of yellow ore which would 
not be processed. 

Information of 105 drill holes has been used in the most recent estimate prepared 
by Wardrop in 2006. Wardrop did not classify the resource which was considered 
to be only indicative of potential for the property. 

The total tonnes of Non Bessemer and Lean Non Bessemer ore appeared high in 
the Wardrop estimate when compared with the original IOCC estimate. A future 
evaluation will have to determine if the "yellow" fractions need to be excluded. 
Recent bulk sample testing has shown that the average specific gravity (SG) for 
the ore is considerable higher than was used in the estimate. The next phase of 
exploration will include a review of the plans and sections, the inclusion of the 
data developed during the proposed drilling and trenching program and the 
analysis of the SG of the ore zones. 

17.3 Knob Lake 1 Property 

The Knob Lake deposit is shown on eight original IOCC sections some 100 feet 
(30 metres) apart which represents a strike length of about 500 metres. Not all 
sections within this strike length have yet been recovered. Some 25 drill holes 
have been drilled on this property which includes one hole drilled by LIM. Details 
of the IOCC resource estimate will be verified in the future program through 
drilling and sampling. 

The IOCC estimate of the resources for Knob Lake 1 of some 3,662,000 tonnes 
is not yet NI 43-101 compliant. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 17-7 Mining & Metallurgy 

17.4 Redmond 2B and 5 Property 

Only the Redmond 5 property has been shown on the ten recovered original 
IOCC sections which are 100 feet (30 metres) apart. This represents a strike 
length of some 300 metres. Data of some 30 drill holes are shown on the 
sections but no detailed verification has yet been made. Details of the IOCC 
resource estimate will be verified in the future program through drilling and 
sampling. 

The IOCC estimate of the resources for the Redmond properties of some 
1,357,000 tonnes is not yet NI 43-101 compliant. 

17.5 Houston 1, 2S and 3 Property 

The Houston Properties (1, 2S and 3) have a strike length of some 800 metres, 
1000 metres and 2400 metres respectively. LIM has some 29 sections, 100 feet 
(30 metres) apart, of the Houston 1 deposit from the files of IOCC, showing the 
different ore zones and the drilling information of some 25 drill holes. The IOCC 
information on the Houston 2S deposit is shown on some 23 sections also 
100 feet (30 metres) apart which show the results of some 20 drill holes.  No 
detailed analysis of the results has yet been made.  Details of the IOCC resource 
estimate will be verified in the future program through drilling and sampling. 

The IOCC estimate of the resources for the Houston properties of some 
9,090,000 tonnes is not yet NI 43-101 compliant. 

17.6 Astray Lake and Sawyer Lake Properties 

The current interpretation of the Astray Lake deposit is based on a compilation 
map dated November 1950.  The map shows several mineralized rock sample 
results over a strike length of some 500 metres each.  The Sawyer Lake deposit 
covers some 6.5 ha over an approximate strike length of 300 metres and is of 
irregular shape located on top of a hill.  Rock samples were taken and showed 
high grade massive hematite mineralization. 

The IOCC estimate of the resources for the Astray Lake and Sawyer Lake 
properties of some 18,000,000 tonnes is not yet NI 43-101 compliant. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 17-8 Mining & Metallurgy 

17.7 Howse and Kivivic Properties 

The Howse deposit has been drilled by IOCC but the detailed information has not 
yet been fully analyzed by LIM.  LIM carried out a field exploration program of 
rock and old drill cutting sampling, mapping and surveying of old drill holes. No 
further details of the Kivivic deposits are yet available.  It is reasonable to believe 
that the resource estimate from IOCC was developed on some drilling/trenching 
results, details of which are not currently available). 

The IOCC estimate of the resources for the Howse and Kivivic properties of 
some 54,546,000 tonnes is not yet NI 43-101 compliant.

18.0 Other Relevant Data and Information (Item 20.0) 
The Knob Lake Iron Range is well known for the hematite-goethite iron deposits 
and this region has been exploited for some 30 years by IOCC. This has been 
extensively shown in this report. Following the verification of the historical 
resources of IOCC, the LIM Project will attempt to reactivate the area and 
determine the potential economics of any new exploitation.  With the iron ore 
prices having increased considerably, the potential of these deposits now owned 
by LIM, appear to be encouraging. The following are some observations that 
illustrate that after a relatively short exploration program these properties could 
enter into a production phase. 

The short-term strategy will be to establish the operation on the best-known 
deposits of James and Houston close to Schefferville and consolidate the 
regional position of LIM. It is assumed that contractors will carry out all mining 
and materials handling operations. It is also likely that LIM will arrange for 
washing and screening of the iron ore. It is planned to operate the plant on a 
12-hour/day basis in April and November and for a 24-hour (two shift) operation 
for the months of May to October resulting in a total production period of eight 
months. Shipping and sales requirements for seasonal deliveries will have to be 
discussed with potential clients. 

18.1 Mining 

The initial production can commence with only minimal additions to the current 
existing infrastructure. It is the intention of LIM to outsource as much of the direct 
production operations, including camp maintenance and light fleet operation, to 
experienced contractors and facility operators as is practical both from an 
operating and from a financial standpoint. As was the case with IOCC, all mining 
operations will be by conventional open pit mining methods. Relatively low 
stripping ratios of waste over ore will be mined during the life of the operations.  

The working period is assumed to start in April and to continue to November with 
a work stoppage of four months. The contractor will mobilize every year in the 
beginning of April to fix roads and service lines, assure adequate supplies and 
rehabilitate the operating pits to a working condition after winter. The owner will 
perform all mine planning, survey and resource/grade control with their own 
personnel. Office space with technical and administrative personnel and 
computers will be required in Schefferville. 

The mining contractor will provide all equipment to drill, blast, load and haul ore, 
waste rock and top soils to the designated locations. Because of the short 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 18-2 Mining & Metallurgy 

distance from the James and Knob Lake deposits ore transport to the processing 
and shipping site would most likely not require an additional haulage fleet 
because the mining trucks could be used. From the Houston property and later 
from Redmond, semi-trailer units will haul the ore to the processing site. The 
waste will be hauled to the specific waste dump sites. For the Astray Lake and 
Sawyer Lake deposits, there will be a barge loading and unloading cycle in 
addition to the truck hauling. 

During the IOCC operations, the yellow ores (limonitic), the low grade iron ores 
(TRX) and high silica ores (HISI) were separated during the mining process and 
stockpiled as waste or for possible blending. LIM plans to evaluate the potential 
for further processing of the yellow ores to produce a saleable product. 

18.2 Processing 

It is believed that the "direct shipping" iron ore produced by IOCC needed none 
or only very little processing and that only crushing and screening was performed 
before the ore was loaded on trains to be transported to Sept-Îles. Wet screening 
to wash out the fines, containing some of the SiO2, was not performed. Some 
testing has been carried out in the past which showed that most of the ore was 
"self draining" so that there was only a low moisture ore shipped in case of 
washing.  LIM intends to evaluate washing and screening of the ore to improve 
the quality and grade of products and to ensure a greater degree of consistency 
in the production of lump ore and sinter fines.  IOCC did not wash the ore during 
historical operations at Schefferville.  It is expected that a washing and screening 
process will remove low grade and silica material and should increase the grades 
of the final product by about 10-15% of the mined grade. 

18.3 Transport and Shipping 

The only means to transport iron ore from Schefferville to sea-ports is by rail. The 
railway originally constructed by IOCC is still available and in operation. It is 
operated by Tshiuetin Rail Transportation Inc. (TRTI). TRTI owns the railway 
track from Schefferville to Ross Bay JCT. (217 km), but operates from 
Schefferville to Sept-Îles for passenger and light freight traffic. No iron ore is 
currently hauled on the TRTI section of the track. An independent preliminary 
study of the TRTI railway was carried out for LIM in August 2006 by Hatch Mott 
MacDonald (Hatch) which concluded that the Menihek Subdivision was in very 
good condition despite more than 20 years of under capitalization. However, 
some refurbishing of the tracks, rails and culverts will have to be carried out 
through a recommended multi-year repair and replacement program. LIM will 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 18-3 Mining & Metallurgy 

have to negotiate an agreement with TRTI and also the Quebec North Shore & 
Labrador Railway (QNS&L) to reach Sept-Îles.  

The CRC railway connects Port-Cartier to Fermont and Gagnon exclusively 
serving the needs of Quebec Cartier Mining Company. This line is not connected 
to the other railway systems. Figure 18-1 shows the different railway systems. 

 

Figure 18-1 
Map of Existing Railway Systems 

 

LIM plans to rehabilitate the old IOCC loading area at Schefferville called the 
Silver Yards. The ore storage, processing facility and product storage based on 
side-loading the rail cars, are established on the Silver Yards area to handle 
James, Houston, Knob Lake and Redmond ores.  



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 18-4 Mining & Metallurgy 

Access to any of the three facilities at Sept-ïles for handling iron ore pellets or 
concentrates in the area needs to be negotiated with owners IOCC, Wabush 
Mines or Quebec Cartier Mining Company or a new facility has to be built. Port 
Cartier is presently not accessible by rail from Schefferville. It is assumed that 
access to either the IOCC facility or Pointe Noire can be obtained, but these 
would require a car unloading installation and conveyors to the port storage area. 
Ship loading with existing port installations is assumed to be possible. 

18.4 Infrastructure 

Schefferville, Quebec is located in Innu territory at an approximate distance of 
2 km from Labrador on the north shore of Knob Lake.  The town was established 
by the IOCC in 1954 to support their mining operations in the area. The township 
has the infrastructure to fulfill the needs of LIM in regards to: roads, power and 
water supply, buildings and sewage facilities. 

The Menihek power plant located 35 km southeast from Schefferville is the only 
provider of electric power to the area. The power plant contains two 5 MW 
Westinghouse generators and one 12 MW unit, sufficient to supply the power 
that LIM would require for the early development sites close to Schefferville 
(James, Knob Lake and Redmond).  In the case of the establishment of the other 
excavation sites (Houston, Astray Lake, Sawyer Lake, Howse and Kivivic), 
portable generators could be used. 

Most of the existing roads that provide access to the different properties 
designated for early development (James, Houston, Knob Lake and Redmond) 
exist and would only need some clean-up. The eventual maintenance of the 
roads and the railways which would again be established on the Silver Yards, as 
well as all other processing facilities and mine sites is assumed to be LIM's 
responsibility. 

Three processing sites are envisioned for the total life of the project. The first one 
near Schefferville, the second near Astray Lake and the third one near Howse 
and Kivivic. All processing sites will have a workshop, a warehouse, and a 
fuelling station near by. General services and infrastructures will be shared with 
the contractor. LIM will establish an administrative office in Schefferville to house 
the engineering, geology and supervisors to control contracted activities. 

Fuel will be supplied to the area from Sept-Ïles and stored in tanks owned and 
maintained by the supplier at Schefferville or at rail yards for delivery to the 
excavation and processing sites. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 18-5 Mining & Metallurgy 

The fire protection for excavation and processing sites will be supplied by local 
communities. The workshop and warehouse will be equipped with fire fighting 
devices as determined by local standards, regulations and building codes. 

All sewage, solid waste, used oil, etc, will be collected from the sites and hauled 
to the Schefferville treatment plant for disposal following the different regulations. 

18.5 Environment 

Although all of LIM's properties are located in the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador, they will utilize, to some extent, present connecting roads on the 
Quebec side of the border and most probably the services available from the 
town of Schefferville and the surrounding communities located in the province of 
Quebec. 

The Schefferville area is located at an inter-provincial boundary area and work 
that is conducted which crosses the border will result in the involvement of both 
Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador regulatory agencies, as well as 
Canadian Federal agencies. Transportation routes, power lines and possibly 
water circulation lines may cross the provincial border. The construction of a road 
or rail route/spur is subject to an environmental assessment under the 
Environmental Quality Act. The lead agency for Newfoundland and Labrador is 
the Department of Environment and Conservation while in Quebec it is The 
Department of Sustainable Development. Schefferville is exempt from the James 
Bay and northern Quebec Agreement and falls under the jurisdiction of the 
Quebec Environment Quality Act. 

Once approval from the ministry is obtained applications for permits need to be 
submitted and approval obtained before construction and installation can 
proceed.  

LIM has been collecting seasonal baseline data since mid-2006 and has entered 
into preliminary discussions with Federal and Provincial regulators with respect to 
permit applications and specific requirements for project designation. 

Each mine site will be closed after depletion of mineable reserves and restored 
according to regulations. The aim is to carry out the final closures without 
continued monitoring requirements. The rehabilitation measures as established in 
the rehabilitation and closure plans are to be started as early as practical during 
operating mine life leaving the final closure activities to a minimum. 

Community support is essential in creating a successful regulatory review as it 
can have dramatic impact on the project schedule and costs. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 18-6 Mining & Metallurgy 

18.6 Community and Social Issues 

LIM has established an active community relations program since mid-2005 and 
an ongoing effort is made to work very closely with the four First Nations to focus 
on developing and maintaining productive working relations, ensuring a good 
understanding of the proposed project and assisting them, in their roles as TRTI 
partners, to identify and undertake the work necessary to allow for a timely 
expansion/upgrade of the TRTI operations to include the shipment of iron ore. 

Regular meetings are held with the different groups and a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) is under discussion which will focus on the identification of 
issues to be included in a formal Impact Benefits Agreement. 

Most of the stores, churches, hospital and recreational facilities originally 
constructed in Schefferville during the time of the IOCC operations no longer 
exist. Educational and medical services are distributed through the two First 
Nations communities. 

18.7 Benefits of the project 

The successful start up of LIM's direct shipping iron ore project will likely be the 
first positive economic stimulus to the northwest Labrador (and Quebec) 
economies in 30 years. It should lead to 20+ years of economic stability. 

The project will develop deposits of iron ore not previously worked by IOCC but 
which were evaluated by IOCC and were part of IOCC's reserves and resources 
at the time of closure of its operations in the area in 1982. The James , Houston, 
Knob Lake and Redmond deposits are located within reach of existing 
infrastructure, including road access, adjacent to electrical power lines and close 
to the railway terminal and proposed loading yard. The Redmond deposit differs 
in that it is located adjacent to the previously worked Redmond #1 open pit. 

Cost effective and reliable rail transportation is going to be a key component of 
any direct shipping iron ore operations. The TRTI railway company is already 
owned by a consortium of First Nations and provides an ideal basis upon which 
to develop other transportation solutions for the project. 

In the construction phase the project could generate up to 300 jobs with that 
number falling to about 150 on an ongoing production basis. The economic 
impact of such employment and contracting business on the surrounding 
communities could be very positive and lead to the development of other support 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 18-7 Mining & Metallurgy 

and service sector jobs and the consistent and planned development and growth 
of the town of Schefferville and surrounding communities. 

18.8 Capital Costs 

There is a high level of existing infrastructure in the Shefferville area, and LIM 
currently intends to utilize contractors for the majority of the operational activities 
who will supply their own capital equipment.  It is not possible at this time to 
provide an estimate of capital costs until the exploration work recommended in 
Section 20.0 has been carried out, the historic resource estimates have been 
converted to current NI 43-101 compliant resource estimates and the feasibility 
study completed. 

18.9 Operating Costs 

It is not possible at this time to provide an estimate of operating costs until the 
exploration work recommended in Section 20.0 has been carried out, the historic 
resource estimates have been converted to current NI 43-101 compliant resource 
estimates and the feasibility study completed. 

18.10 Markets 

The market for iron ores and related products has seen some substantial 
changes in recent years.  These have been driven in the most part by the 
booming resurgence of the Chinese economy and that country's rapidly 
increasing demand for raw materials particularly steel and its feed product, iron 
ore. This demand in the first instance has been met by increases in Australian 
and, to a lesser extent, Indian and Brazilian supply. 

It is expected that the European market is the most likely destination for products 
from the LIM project given the potential freight advantage over other producers, 
but there remains a strong demand from the Far East and in particular from 
China for iron ore.  

Iron ore prices, other than for pellets and some minor DRI feeds, are based on 
sinter fine prices, with a premium for lump. In practise this lump premium varies, 
thereby establishing a true lump price. 

SNC-Lavalin is not aware of any further relevant data or information that not has 
been already discussed in this Technical Report. 

 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 19-1 Mining & Metallurgy 

19.0 Interpretation and Conclusions (Item 21) 
The review of the data that was made available to SNC-Lavalin for LIM's project 
related to a renewed development of the iron deposits in Labrador near 
Schefferville, Quebec has shown that there is more than sufficient merit for an 
exploration program to verify the resources estimated by IOCC. The results of the 
program will support the undertaking of a feasibility study, which will among other 
things, bring the historic estimates of resources to comply with the requirements 
of NI 43-101. 

IOCC has worked in the same areas of Quebec and Labrador between 1954 and 
1982 and produced some 150 million tons of "lump and direct shipping" iron ore 
and carried out exploration to extend the life of these operation to well after 1982. 
When the economic conditions changed and the market for that ore was not 
longer attractive, the mines closed. However, the explored deposits remained 
ready for exploitation when favorable market conditions would return and the 
economics of new mines could be demonstrated. Some of these deposits are 
now owned, wholly or partially, by LIM and a feasibility study will have to be 
produced to demonstrate economic viability of the restart of the iron ore 
production. The resource estimates for the properties comprising LIM's project 
were established by IOCC, an experienced iron ore operator, during the 20+ year 
period that IOCC successfully operated mines in the Schefferville area which 
were developed on the basis of similar resource estimates. There is no reason to 
conclude that IOCC utilized other than best industry practices. It is reasonable, 
therefore, to conclude that such historic resources can be easily brought to 
compliance with NI 43-101 requirements with a program of verification as 
recommended herein. The first step for this study is the confirmation of the 
resources for the properties and to make the resource estimates NI 43-101 
compliant.  

The resources from four deposit sites (James, Knob Lake, Houston and 
Redmond) are the closest to the existing Schefferville infrastructure. Most 
infrastructure is already in place and relative low capital expenditures will be 
required to restore and revamp the old structures and rail yards.  The production 
of the "direct shipping" ore requires only a simple process of screening, crushing 
and, in some cases, washing and the capital cost of building such a processing 
plant near Schefferville would be relatively low.  



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 19-2 Mining & Metallurgy 

Following the initial production phase the plant can be moved closer to the other 
deposits. A first phase of confirmation exploration will be needed to confirm and 
supplement the old data produced by IOCC for these four sites. Details of the 
program are shown in the next section. 

The other four deposits (Astray Lake and Sawyer Lake as well as Howse and 
Kivivik) are all considerable further from Schefferville and require much more 
infrastructure development and therefore higher capital expenditures. The 
knowledge of these deposits is also less detailed and more exploration will be 
required to bring these historic inferred resources to a NI 43-101 compliance 
indicated classification. When these resources are demonstrated to exist the 
feasibility of producing from these deposits can be evaluated. The proposed 
exploration phase is also shown in the next section.

20.0 Recommendations (Item 22.0) 

20.1 Introduction 

Following the review of all supplied data and the interpretation and conclusions of 
this review it is recommended that a three-phase exploration program should be 
started. The continuation of each phase of the program depends on the 
exploration results obtained and on the evaluation of the new data. The three 
phases are related to the projection of the possible iron production scenarios that 
are made possible because of the exploration results. The following phases are 
proposed with only the first phase outlined and budgeted in detail. 

 Phase I Confirm resource data for James, Houston, Knob Lake and 
Redmond deposits and make the resource estimates NI 43-101 compliant 
through reverse circulation drilling and trench sampling.  The mining of 
these deposits is scheduled during the first 5-6 years of the project.  
Magnetometer and gravity surveys as well as some trenching and 
sampling of the Astray Lake and Sawyer Lake deposits scheduled for a 
second production period.  Gravity surveys and general exploration of the 
Howse and Kivivic deposits scheduled to be mined as a third production 
period. 

 Phase II Additional reverse circulation drilling and trench sampling of the 
Astray Lake and Sawyer Lake deposits and confirmation of the resources 
estimated during Phase I. Reverse circulation drilling and trenching of the 
Howse and Kivivic deposits and estimate of resources. This exploration 
phase can be carried out while production of the James, Houston, Knob 
Lake and Redmond deposits is in progress. 

 Phase III Continued exploration of the Astray Lake and Sawyer Lake 
deposits as well as the Howse and Kivivic deposits to ascertain sufficient 
reserves for continued iron production.

20.2 Phase I Program 

A program of reverse circulation drilling will be used to confirm the interpretation 
of the IOCC grades and geological formations. The trench sampling will provide 
material for process testing recommended to be carried out to optimize the 
selection of a final process flow sheet.  IOCC reserve estimates applied an 
average SG of 3.5 for all ore intersections for, at that time, a more simplified 
manual calculation of reserves. The current estimating process with computer 
models allows the use of a variable SG for all Fe-grades in the deposit.  It is 
recommended that a theoretical SG graph be developed and compared with the 
SG test results of the samples from the trenches and these results used for the 
reserve estimates. 

The Phase I program and budget required to bring the resource and reserve 
estimates of the various deposits to be NI 43-101 compliant are as follows: 

20.2.1 James Deposit 

Two trenches (on sections 92 and 86) should be excavated, mapped and 
sampled, in addition to the trench excavated in 2006 (on section line 89) in the 
Northern Ore Body. Two reverse circulation drill holes (on the same sections) 
each some 100 metres deep. 

Two trenches (on sections 76 and 71) should be excavated, mapped and 
sampled in the Southern Ore Body. Two reverse circulation drill holes (on the 
same sections) each some 100 metres deep. 

Estimated budget for James Deposit: 

Trenches 400 metres @ $ 250/m $ 100,000 

Drilling 400 metres @ $ 200/m   $ 80,000 

Total James Deposit $ 180,000 

20.2.2 Knob Lake Deposit 

Because no detailed plan is yet available for the Knob Lake deposit, the 
proposed location of the trench and drill holes is less precise. It is proposed to 
excavate one trench (on section 21) that must be mapped and sampled. Two 
reverse circulation drill holes (on section 21 and 24) are recommended each 
some 100 metres deep. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 20-3 Mining & Metallurgy 

Estimated budget for Knob Lake Deposit: 

Trench 100 metres @ $ 250/m $ 25,000 

Drilling 200 metres @ $ 200/m $ 40,000 

Total Knob Lake Deposit  $ 65,000 

20.2.3 Redmond Deposits 

To confirm the small amount of resources reported by IOCC, one drill hole on the 
Redmond 2B deposit and two on the Redmond 5 deposit would be required. The 
reverse circulation drill holes for Redmond 5 deposit could be drilled on section 
143 and 141 and which are expected to be some 100 metres and 70 metres 
deep respectively. One trench on section 143 should be excavated, mapped and 
sampled. 

Estimated budget for Redmond Deposits: 

Trench  400 metres @ $ 250/m $ 100,000 

Drilling 170 metres @ $ 200/m   $ 34,000 

Total Redmond Deposits $ 134,000 

20.2.4 Houston Lake Deposits 

These three deposits form the largest amount of resources in the area close to 
Schefferville.  At this time the plan and sections for two of the deposits have been 
recovered.  Houston 1, the most southern deposit, should be drilled with three 
reverse circulation drill holes each about 100 metres deep on sections 354, 350 
and 347.  One trench has been excavated during 2006 and two other 300 metres 
long trenches should be excavated, mapped and sampled on two of the sections 
drilled. 

Two reverse circulation drill holes should be drilled on the Houston 2S deposit on 
sections 326 and 322, each some 100 to 120 metres deep.  It should be decided 
if these holes could be drilled with an angle of 30° to the southwest, to intersect 
the projected ore zones.  Two 200 metres long trenches should be excavated on 
the same sections and must be mapped and sampled. 

Detailed information for the Houston 3 deposit has not yet been studied but it is 
anticipated that one reverse circulation drill hole of some 100 metres deep and 
one 200 metres long trench will be sufficient to confirm these resources. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 20-4 Mining & Metallurgy 

Estimated budget for Houston Deposits: 

Trenches  900 metres @ $ 250/m $ 225,000 

Drilling 620 metres @ $ 200/m $ 124,000 

Total Houston Deposits $ 349,000 

The interpretation and results of the above drilling and sampling programs should 
be sufficient to convert the IOCC resources estimate for these deposits into an 
estimate compliant with NI 43-101. 

Other Phase I recommended exploration for the four other deposits, Astray Lake 
and Sawyer Lake and Howse and Kivivic, will consist of gravity surveys, 
magnetometre surveys and some trenching, mapping and sampling. The estimate 
for this program is included in the budget estimate shown in Table 20-1.

 Total Estimated Cost Phase I Confirmation Exploration  $    2,003,000 

 

20.3 Feasibility Study 

Subsequent to the confirmation exploration program, outlined in the foregoing 
section, a complete feasibility study has to be prepared to determine the viability 
of the project for the renewed iron production.  The feasibility study will have to 
emphasize not only on the volume and value of the resources and the production 
costs, but in particular on the environmental requirements of the region, the 
transport of the iron ore to the harbour for shipment to markets and on the 
demands of local communities and the social issues. 



 

 

30R_017658_0001_10 October2007_rev1.doc 20-6 Mining & Metallurgy 

The environmental base line studies are started and will continue and 
discussions with Federal and Provincial authorities are to be held to obtain the 
various permits. 

The negotiations with TRTI and QNS&L rail transportation companies will have to 
be held and agreements for ore transport to be signed.  Detailed studies for the 
rehabilitation of the existing rail yards and rail tracks have to be carried out, as 
well as the determination and negotiations for the availability and use of harbour 
unloading and ship loading facilities. 

A preliminary budget for the feasibility study is shown in Table 20-2.
