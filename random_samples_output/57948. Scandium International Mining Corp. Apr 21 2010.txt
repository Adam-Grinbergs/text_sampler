SUMMARY 

i. Property Description and Location 

The Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Deposit (also called "Nyngan" or "Gilgai") lies 20 
kilometres almost due west of the town of Nyngan, approximately 450 kilometres 
northwest of Sydney, New South Whales, Australia. The deposit occurs 5 kilometres 
south of Miandetta, off the Barrier Highway that connects the town of Nyngan to the 
town of Cobar. The property is situated in flat countryside and is classed as agricultural 
land - used for wheat farming and pasture. It lies within MGA zone 55, coordinates GDA 
94, Lat: -31.5987, Long: 146.9827. 
 
The tenements are designated (New South Wales Department of Industry and 
Investment - Primary Industries) Exploration Licence (EL) no. 6009 (southern area) - 
Bourke 1:1,000,000 sheet, block 3132, units d, e, j, k; block 3133, unit f; and EL 6096 - 
Bourke 1:1,000,000 sheet, block 3132, unit p; block 3133, units l, m, r, s, (29.25 square 
kilometres). The location of the properties'' can be found on Map Sheets 1:250k – Cobar 
(SH/55-14) and 1:100k Hermidale (8234).   
 
The licences are under an Assessment Lease Application (ALA) which is pending, but 
the Exploration Licences are current. 
 
ii. Ownership 

The Gilgai Scandium Deposit is 100% under licence by Jervois Mining Limited.  The land 
on which the resource is located has been purchased by Jervois Mining Limited for the 
development of this resource.  The mineral resource described in this report is entirely 
on land owned by Jervois Mining Limited and under current EL by Jervois Mining 
Limited.  Access to the mine area through private land is under negotiation with 
relevant land owners. 
 
iii. Geology and Mineralization 

The area is dominated by Cainozoic alluvial plains derived from the Darling River Basin 
with minor colluvium and outcrop. The region is situated on the shallow southern 
margin of the Surat Basin, known as the Coonamble Embayment. There is evidence of 
varying degrees of lateritisation in the area. The Gilgai complex is covered by 8 to 50 
metres of alluvial material. 
 
The Gilgai intrusive complex, which is believed to be the source of the scandium, nickel, 
cobalt and PGMs in the regolith,  is an Alaskan-type ultramafic complex made up of a 
range of rock types including hornblende monzonite, hornblendite, pyroxenite, olivine 
pyroxenite to dunite-peridotites, and is believed to be of Ordovician age. The intrusives 
are included within the 'Fifield Platinum Province'.  
 
iv. Exploration 

In the late 1980's Lachlan Resources N.L., as manager for "Platinum Search NL", 
explored for PGE mineralization in the area using RAB and diamond drilling.   Airborne 
and ground magnetic surveys were used to locate and delineate an intrusive ultramafic 
complex considered prospective for PGE mineralization. In 2001 two further traverses 
of RC drilling were undertaken.

Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 5 
 

Jervois Mining Limited continued drilling in the area in January/February 2006.   An 
aircore drilling programme of 2638 metres in 69 holes was completed on the Gilgai 
Scandium Project (EL 6009). The drilling targeted a laterite that had previously been 
explored by Platsearch.  Since the 2006 program a further 9 holes, for an additional 
316m of drilling, have been completed (total Jervois Mining Limited drilling: 78 holes 
for 2954m). 
 
v. Mineral Resource 

Jervois' drilling program in 2006 involved 50 metre spaced RC percussion and aircore 
drill holes (25 metre sphere of influence for each hole) chosen over shallow overburden 
and 'visual quality' of the limonite horizon. 
 
The resources have been calculated by plan polygonal methods for each of the four 
resource lithological categories – hematite, limonite, saprolite and bedrock. The volume 
of each block is the polygonal area times drill thickness. A minimum of 2 metres 
thickness has been used. An arbitrary lower cut-off grade of 100ppm Sc has been 
employed. The density calculations are based on the weight of the samples produced 
from the drill holes. 
 
The drillhole diameter in this programme was 3½ inches (or 0.0889 metres). Thus the 
volume of 1 metre drilled is 0.006207167 cubic metres. This factor has been applied to 
each intersection within the resource calculations to obtain an in situ density for each 
lithology. 
 
To obtain the rock densities an adjustment has been made by making a moisture 
content correction. The parent rocks are slightly different in density; the pyroxenite 
approximately 3.2 t/m3 and the serpentinite approximately 2.2t/m3.  The parent density 
figures may be ambiguous because the lateritisation weathering process is not the same 
for the two rock types. The density figures quoted are on the conservative side. 
Using the above parameters, the resource figures below have been calculated from the 
results of the recent drilling: 
 
vi. Tonnes/Grade (ppm Sc)  

Scandium: 12 million tonnes at 261 ppm Sc  including 

 1.5 million tonnes at 330 ppm Sc Measured Resource of Limonite lithology 

 
An Assessment Lease Application (ALA), no 43 was lodged with the NSW Department of 
Industry and Investment (I&I) in June 2008, and is currently pending. 
 
vii. Development and Operations 

Recent process test work on the ore has yielded recoveries of greater than 90% 
scandium and this research is nearing completion. A ready market has already shown 
interest in scandium oxide to 99.9% purity. Scandium is envisaged for use in fuel cell 
technology with an initial demand of up to 10 tonnes p/a and increasing. 
 
On February 8th 2010, EMC metals Corp. (EMC) and Jervois Mining Limited (Jervois) 
signed a Joint Venture agreement to develop the Gilgai Deposit where EMC will manage the 
Joint Venture Project.

Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 6 
 

 
Under the Agreement, EMC has paid the sum of CAD $300,000 into escrow to be released 
to Jervois upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including verification of title to 
the Nyngan property and approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
 
The Agreement requires EMC to incur exploration and metallurgical work of AUS $500,000 
(CAD $460,000) within 180 business days of the conditions precedent being satisfied, or pay 
cash in lieu thereof. In the event that EMC wishes to continue the joint venture, EMC must 
deliver a bankable feasibility study within 480 business days of the conditions precedent 
being satisfied, failing which the Agreement will terminate. 
 
Upon EMC delivering the bankable feasibility study to Jervois, EMC must pay to Jervois an 
additional AUS $1,300,000 plus GST at which time it will be granted a 50% interest in the 
joint venture. The Agreement provides for straight-line dilution, with interests diluted below 
10% being converted into a 2% Net Smelter Returns Royalty. 
 

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1 Terms of Reference and Purpose of Report 

This report has been prepared by Jervois Mining Limited at the request of EMC in order 
to prepare a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) compliant Technical 
Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Resource, Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia. 
   
Jervois Mining Limited is in its 46th year as a listed mining company of the Australian 
Stock Exchange (ASX).  The company started in 1963 heap leaching copper oxide in the 
Jervois Ranges in the Northern Territory and then moved to oil tenements in the Cooper 
and Perth basins. In 1987 the company gradually acquired mineral tenements for gold 
and base metals. 
 
At the present time, one of the company's principal assets is the company's scandium 
resource near Nyngan, NSW.  
 
This document provides a Technical Report on Resources of the Nyngan Gilgai 
Scandium Resource (also called "Nyngan" and "Gilgai"), prepared according to NI-43-
101 guidelines. Form NI 43-101F1 was used as the format for this report. The intent of 
this Technical Report on Resources is to provide the reader with a comprehensive 
review of the historical exploration activities conducted at the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium 
Resource, and a current resource estimate based on 78 holes for 2954m. 
 
This Technical Report on Resources was prepared using the guidelines of the 
Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves – The JORC Code 2004, in line with the Canadian Securities Administrators 
revised regulations in NI 43-101 (Standards of Disclosure For Mineral Projects) and 
Companion Policy 43-101CP. 
 
1.2 Reliance on Other Experts  

The Qualified Person (QP), Max Rangott has examined the historical data for the Nyngan 
Gilgai Scandium Resource submitted to him by Jervois Mining Limited and has relied 
upon that basic data to support the statements and opinions presented in this Technical 
Report on Resources. In the opinion of the QP, the historical data is present in sufficient 



 

NI43-101 Technical Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project 
Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 7 
 

detail, is credible and verifiable in the field, and is an accurate representation of the 
Gilgai Scandium Resource. The historic documentation available for the Gilgai Scandium 
Resource is extensive in most areas, and of good quality. It is the opinion of the QP that 
there are no material gaps in the drilling and assay information for the project. 
Sufficient information is available to prepare this report, and any statements in this 
report related to deficiency of information are directed at information, which, in the 
opinion of the author/s, either has been lost over the period of inactivity and ownership 
transfers, is stored in non-sorted corporate file cases, or it was not gathered by previous 
workers. 
 
This report includes technical information, which requires subsequent calculations to 
derive subtotals, totals, and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a 
degree of rounding and consequently can introduce a margin of error. Where these 
rounding errors occur, Max Rangott does not consider them to be material. 
 
The author/s have relied upon the work of others in referring specifically to Sections 2 
through 9: Property Description and Location, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure,

1.3 Qualifications of Consultant and Familiarity with the Project/Site. 

Max Rangott. B Sc (Uni Syd)  

I have been a working geologist since 1967.  In my current position, since 1987, I have 
been a Director of Rangott Mineral Exploration Pty. Ltd., (RME) at Orange, NSW.  RME 
specialises in geological consulting and exploration contracting for a wide variety of 
clients, in the search for base and precious metals, tin-tungsten-lithium industrial 
minerals and gemstone deposits. 
 
My recent experience includes the management of RME, with supervision of employee 
geologists on contracting and consulting jobs, project supervision, provision of 
geologists and back-up crews on a "dryhire" basis, and direct consulting and contracting 
work on specific jobs. Direct involvement in specific projects ranges from major field 
campaigns to office data reviews, reporting, and advising clients on ground selection, 
dealing with regulatory requirements, and so on. 
 
I am a Fellow of the AusIMM , a member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists, the 
Geological Society of Australia and the Mineral Industry Consultants Association.    
 
I have had an indirect involvement with a number of Jervois' laterite projects, including 
Gilgai, over the past ten years, mainly by supplying field assistants and geologists for 
field programmes, supervising the sampling of drill core (Young project), and the 
planning of ground magnetic surveys.  In 1988 and 1990 I was the drillsite geologist and 
exploration supervisor for Platsearch NL, when we carried out the first few geochemical 



 

NI43-101 Technical Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project 
Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 9 
 

drilling programmes at the Gilgai site. I also conducted a technical tour of the Platsearch 
properties in central NSW, including Gilgai, with representatives of Toyota Tsusho 
Corporation, who had entered a joint venture for platinum exploration with Platsearch 
and Devex Ltd. 
 
I consider that I am familiar with the technical details of the Gilgai project, but have 
remained independent from Jervois' exploration drive there. 
 
2. Property Description and Location  

2.1 Property Location 

The Gilgai scandium deposit lies 20 kilometres almost due west of Nyngan, 
approximately 450 kilometres northwest of Sydney. The deposit occurs 5 kilometres 
south of Miandetta, off the Barrier Highway that connects Nyngan to Cobar (Appendix 1 
Location Map- Jervois Tenements, Nyngan). 
 
The drive from the town of Nyngan to the property takes approximately 20 minutes. 
The area can be reached via the paved Barrier Highway which allows year round access 
but access to the site itself is along clay farm tracks making access in wet conditions 
difficult.  Consultation with land owners to gain access and construct an all-weather 
gravel road has commenced.  
 
The resource site is located at geographic coordinates MGA zone 55, GDA 94, Lat: -
31.5987, Long: 146.9827, Map Sheets 1:250k – Cobar (SH/55-14) and 1:100k 
Hermidale (8234).   
 
2.2 Mineral Titles 

The Gilgai resource is held under the mineral title – Exploration Licence (EL) 6009 
(Block Number 3132, units d, e, j, k and Block no. 3133, unit f) and EL 6096 (Block 3132, 
unit p, and Block 3133, units l, m, r and s).  An Assessment Lease Application is currently 
pending over the area of these two ELs and over a third area, EL 6095, located 25km to 
the south-southwest.   
 

The Exploration Licences allow Jervois Mining Limited to conduct exploration on 
private land (with landowner consents and signed compensation agreements in place) 
and public lands not including wildlife reserves, heritage areas or National Parks.  The 
Scandium resource is fully enclosed on private agricultural land currently owned by 
Jervois Mining Limited.   
 
Jervois Mining Limited owns both the surface and mineral rights.   The local 
administrative body is the Bogan Shire Council, Nyngan NSW.   The Shire Council rates, 
to retain ownership of the land, (subject to annual assessment) are AU$828.19, current 
to August 2010. Rates are paid at the Bogan Shire Council Offices on or before August 
31st each year.   
 
Additionally, Jervois Mining Limited is required to submit Interim and Annual 
Exploration Progress Report to the Department of Industry and Investment, NSW, 
outlining any work (R&D and/or exploration) and expenditure throughout the year on 
the tenements held.   This is a requirement to retain tenure of the licences held.  A 



 

NI43-101 Technical Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project 
Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 10 
 

minimum expenditure is required on the tenements held and expenditure details must 
be included in the reports. 
 
The free hold property boundaries are defined by standard land survey techniques 
undertaken by the Lands Department and currently presented in the form of Cadastral 
Deposited Plans (DP) and Lots. The land owned by Jervois Mining Limited is DP 752879, 
Lots 6 and 7 (Appendix 2, Lots 6 and 7 - Nyngan). 
 
The combined area of the tenements covering the Gilgai scandium resource is 29.25 sq. 
km (of which approximately 14.6 sq km is EL 6096 and 14.6 sq km is the southern area 
of EL 6009.)  The main resource area (at cut off 100ppm Sc) covers approximately 0.5sq 
km, although the true extent is as yet not delineated. 
 
2.3 Location of Mineralization 

The area is dominated by Cainozoic alluvial plains derived from the Darling River Basin 
with minor colluvium and outcrop. The region is situated on the shallow southern 
margin of the Surat Basin, known as the Coonamble Embayment. There is evidence of 
varying degrees of lateritisation in the area. 
 
The western-most north-south structural zone of the Lachlan fold belt is known as the 
Girilambone Structural Zone. It is composed of Cambrian-Ordovician metasediments 
known as the Girilambone Group intruded by numerous mafic and ultramafic bodies of 
similar age and by middle Silurian granite and volcanic. 
 
To the north of the Gilgai Resource is the south-west limb of a north-south trending 
arcuate belt of serpentinised ultramafic known as the West Lynn Serpentinite.   A small 
block of ultramafic to the immediate north-west is the Miandetta intrusion. Thin section 
analysis has interpreted the West Lynn Serpentinite as being derived from the 
alteration of a medium grained dunite. The linear nature of the West Lynn ultramafic 
unit suggests an Alpine-type origin, supported by low levels of PGE's. The Miandetta 
intrusion may be a dismembered portion of the West Lynn Serpentinite. 
 
The Gilgai resource, located to the south of this belt is an Alaskan-type zoned intrusive 
complex (the 'Gilgai Complex') made up of a range from hornblende monzonite, 
hornblendite, pyroxenite, olivine-pyroxenite to dunite-peridotites. The intrusives are 
included within the 'Fifield Platinum Province'. The Gilgai Complex is covered by 8 to 
>50 metres of alluvium and soil. 
 
A regional geological interpretation plan (Appendix 6 Bedrock Geological 
Interpretation) has been drawn based on bedrock intersections in both recent and 
previous drilling. Because of the weathered nature of the drill cuttings, the geological 
plan must be considered interpretive. 
 
The igneous rock types encountered have been logged as: 
Pyroxenite; Olivine Pyroxenite; Hornblende Pyroxenite; Hornblendite; Magnetite 
Pyroxenite; Dunite; and Monzonite. 
 
There is a suggestion of a layered pattern of the complex in a NW-SE direction (this is 
supported by the magnetic trend). There also appears to be a zone of stronger alteration

in the (south) centre of the complex where abundant magnetite and mica (phlogopite) 
occur. 
 
Tertiary lateritisation of the Gilgai Complex has produced the fairly standard laterite 
profile outlined below: 
 
Hematitic clay 
Limonitic clay 
Saprolitic clay 
Weathered bedrock 
Fresh bedrock 
 
Thicknesses of > 40 metres of weathered bedrock have been intersected. The hematite 
zone is overlain by alluvials with a high proportion of gravels.  
 
A palaeochannel system contains a younger colluvial-alluvial sequence of silts, sands 
and ferruginous gravels. Regolith-landform mapping and dating of key regolith 
materials has established the landscape history back to the Early Jurassic. This history 
reflects dominant subaerial exposure. There has been ongoing weathering, erosion and 
deposition controlled by bedrock composition, climate change, changes in base level 
and some neo-tectonic activity.  
 
2.4 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances 

A Royalty Agreement was reached between Jervois and Plumbum Pty Ltd and Kannateal 
Pty Ltd (previous owners of the Exploration Licence area). Jervois is to pay a royalty 
equivalent of 1.5% of Net Smelter Return on any metal produced from the tenement. 
This agreement was dated 4th June 2002 and was registered with the Department of 
Mineral Resources (now I&I) and for Stamp Duty. A similar agreement on EL6096 
(Gilgai) was signed on 30 October 2003 and registered with the DPI on 22nd January 
2004. 
 
2.5 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 

2.5.1 Required Permits and Status 

The mineral resources discussed in this report are all located on private land owned by 
Jervois Mining Limited.  Normally any exploration must be with the land owner's 
written approval and a compensation agreement in place prior to work commencing.   
 
Exploration activities must also be compliant with Environmental Management 
Guidelines for the 'EDG 10 Surface Disturbance Notice (SDN) for Exploration Activities' 
under Part 5 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979, and written 
approval must be received from the Department of I&I prior to the commencement of 
surface disturbing operations such as drilling.  
 
The permit application is five-pages which outlines 1.  A description of the project, 2. 
Proposed exploration activities and a 3. Proposed rehabilitation plan.  This should be 
submitted at least 1 month prior to exploration activities and must be accompanied by 
pre-drilling photographs, description of the drill area and followed up with a drilling 
report and photographs of the drill sites post-drilling.

All exploration and mining activity in NSW (with the exception of Private Mining 
Agreements) must be conducted on granted titles and these are issued and 
administered by the Department's Titles Branch.  These titles provide the control 
mechanism for government by stipulating operating and environmental conditions.  
They also give proponents and title holders exclusive rights to explore and mine for 
minerals, as well as the guaranteed security of tenure (subject to meeting the 
Department's guidelines) required for investment in minerals exploration and mining 
development. The Mining Act (1992) covers onshore NSW.  
 
In order to commence mining a Mining Lease Application will be prepared and 
submitted for approval. Rights to mine will only be granted after Development Consent 
has been granted by the local government body (subject to acceptance of an 
Environmental Impact Statement). 
 
3. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography  

3.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The topography is mildly undulating to flat elevated plateaus at an average elevation of 
173m asl.   The area is overlain with alluvial red clays which display 'gilgai-type' 
swelling characteristics.   
 
The area is predominantly dry eucalypt and native pine woodland. Large areas of 
original woodlands have been permanently altered through the removal of pine for 
timber, the grazing of shrubs by livestock and the invasion of woody weeds. 
 
3.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season  

The Nyngan area has a sub arid climate with the highest mean maximum (summer) 
temperature of 34oC in January and a mean (winter) minimum temperature of 16oC. 
Yearly average maximum temperature of 25.7 oC and a minimum yearly average of 11.7 
oC in July. 
 
The mean maximum (summer) rainfall of 51mm occurs in January and the  mean 
(winter) rainfall minimum of 27mm in September.  Nyngan is under a sub tropical to 
tropical influence from the north of the continent.  The operating season of the mine can 
be all year round if all-weather gravel roads are constructed for access. 
 

3.3 Access to Property 

Access to the Gilgai Resource is via the Barrier Highway which links the towns of 
Nyngan and Cobar.  Approximately 25 km to the west of Nyngan is a turn-off to the 
southwest along the paved Gilgai Road.  The deposit is 5 kilometres south of Miandetta. 
Access from this point is via private dirt and gravel tracks.   
 
3.4 Surface Rights 

Jervois Mining Limited owns surface rights to approximately 800 acres of land which 
encompasses the resource. The surface rights are managed by Hetherington Explotaion 
and Mining Title Services Pty. Ltd., Sydney, NSW on behalf of Jervois Mining Limited.

3.5 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

3.5.1 Access Road and Transportation 
The township of Nyngan is accessed by the Barrier and Mitchell Highways.  There is a 
seasonally used single track rail line used for hauling grain and sulphide concentrates 
from mines at Cobar to the eastern seaboard ports.  
 

3.5.2 Power Supply 

There is a major electricity substation at Dubbo NSW approximately 170 km from the 
Gilgai Resource.  High voltage powerlines run parallel to the Barrier Highway from 
Nyngan to Cobar, and passes within 3 km of the resource area, and domestic power 
lines run along the Gilgai Rd.   
 
3.5.3 Water Supply 

Ground water is present in significant aquifers in the district, but a licence will be 
required to extract water, or an existing licence may be purchased from elsewhere in 
the Macquarie River catchment. A dam on the property is constantly fed though 
seepage. Water supply pipelines run from Nyngan to Cobar parallel to the Barrier 
Highway.  
 

3.5.4 Port 

The nearest port facility is at Newcastle, located approximately 500 km from the Gilgai 
Resource.   
 

3.5.5 Buildings and Ancillary Facilities 

At the time or writing there are no buildings or ancillary facilities on the site.  A draft 
mine plan has been prepared but not yet implemented.  Jervois is yet to commence the 
permitting process to undertake mining activities.   
 
3.5.6 Manpower 

Abundant labour for technical and hourly staff is available in Nyngan, Cobar and other 
regional communities. Nyngan has a population of 2500 and offers most amenities. 
 
4. History  

4.1 Ownership  

The Gilgai Scandium Deposit is 100% held under licence by Jervois Mining Limited.  The 
freehold title to the land under which the resource is located has been purchased by 
Jervois Mining Limited for the development of this resource.  The mineral resource 
described in this report is entirely under the land owned by Jervois Mining Limited and 
under current ELs held by Jervois Mining Limited.   Access to the mine area through 
private land is under negotiation with relevant land owners. 
 

4.2 Past Exploration and Development 

The first systematic exploration in the region was by Selection Trust in the late 1970's, 
targeting base metal and gold mineralization. Work included mapping, rock chip 
sampling and the drilling of seven percussion drill holes. The results returned were not 
deemed encouraging by Selection Trust, however values of up to 1.16% nickel were 
reported.

Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 14 
 

North Broken Hill Ltd. took up a number of tenements in the late 1970s and early 1880s 
initially to look for tin, but later for ultrabasic related sulphide mineralization.   In the 
Honeybugle area, they conducted regional exploration including the drilling of 52 auger 
holes on Pangee Road and at the Pangee Road Pits for a cumulative 287 metres. 
 
Lachlan Resources N.L., as manager of the "Platsearch Group" explored for PGE 
mineralization in the late 1980's, relinquishing the ground in 1993. Airborne and 
ground magnetic surveys were used to locate and delineate the intrusive "Alaskan-
style" ultramafic complexes considered to be prospective for PGE mineralization, 
modeled initially on the platinum bearing Tout (Syerston) intrusive complex near 
Fifield, then on the Kars Complex neat Condoboin. Broad-spaced RAB drilling identified 
a platiniferous zone at the western end of the large Gilgai complex. A follow-up 
programme included detailed ground magnetic surveys and RAB drilling at 25m x 50m 
spacing over an area of 400m x 500m. A total of 134 RAB holes for a cumulative 6,779m 
were drilled. Two inclined diamond holes were also completed each 250m deep. Assay 
results from the diamond drilling programme showed peak values of 1.53 g/t Pt, and 
revealed an iron-rich phase with abundant magnetite and minor sulphides including 
pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite. Neutron Activation Scans by Becquerel on five 
samples of DDH1 core included three samples from the iron-rich phase. These samples 
assayed 108, 104 and 110 g/t scandium as shown below:

Anaconda's exploration between 1999 and 2001 concentrated on searching for 
nickel/cobalt enrichment in laterites overlying serpentinite. To this end, Anaconda 
completed some 31 kilometres of ground magnetic traversing and put down 2302 
metres of RC drilling in 54 holes.  Significant results are itemized in the table 5.1.1.  
Further work was planned by Anaconda but was not carried out.

5. Geologic Setting  

5.1 Regional and Local Geology 

The area is dominated by Cainozoic alluvial plains derived from the Darling River Basin 
with minor colluvium and outcrop. The region is situated on the shallow southern 
margin of the Surat Basin, known as the Coonamble Embayment. There is evidence of 
varying degrees of lateritisation in the area. 
 
The western-most north-south structural zone of the Lachlan fold belt is known as the 
Girilambone Structural Zone. It is composed of Cambrian-Ordovician metasediments  
 
 
and minor basic volcanics known as the Girilambone Group, intruded by numerous 
mafic and ultramafic bodies of similar age and by middle Silurian granite and volcanics. 
 
The northern part of the project area covers the south-west limb of a north-south 
trending arcuate belt of serpentinised ultramafics known as the West Lynn Serpentinite 
and a small block of ultramafics to the south-west called the Miandetta intrusion. Thin 
section analysis has interpreted the West Lynn Serpentinite as being derived from the 
alteration of a medium grained dunite. The linear nature of the West Lynn ultramafic 
unit suggests an Alpine-type origin, supported by the low levels of PGEs determined by 
assays. The Miandetta intrusion may be a dismembered portion of the West Lynn 
Serpentinite. 
 
In the south, the Gilgai and Honeybugle intrusive complexes are Alaskan-type 
complexes made up of a range from hornblende monzonite, hornblendite, pyroxenite 
and olivine pyroxenite to dunite-peridotites. The intrusives are included within the 
'Fifield Platinum Province'. The Gilgai complex is covered by 8 to 50 metres of Tertiary 
to Recent age alluvial material, with alluvium detected to 85m depth near the northern 
margin of the complex. 
 

6. Deposit Type  

The Gilgai resource is located within a limonitic and saprolitic Tertiary laterite which 
has a fairly typical laterite profile: 
Haematitic clay 
Limonitic clay 
Saprolitic clay 
Weathered bedrock 
Fresh bedrock 
 
The resource is centred over the more mafic phases of the zoned Gilgai ultramafic 
complex. Weathering persists to 60m depth in the northern flanks of the complex.  
 
7. Mineralization 

A geological interpretation plan was prepared, based on bedrock intersections in both 
recent and previous drilling. Because of the weathered nature of the drill cuttings, the 



 

NI43-101 Technical Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project 
Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 16 
 

geological plan must be considered interpretive. The igneous rock types encountered 
have been logged as: 
Pyroxenite; Olivine Pyroxenite; Hornblende Pyroxenite; Hornblendite; Magnetite 
Pyroxenite; Dunite; and Monzonite. 
 
There is a suggestion of a layered trend of the complex in a NW-SE direction (this is 
supported by the magnetic pattern).  These trends reflect a broadly concentric zonation 
of lithologies in the complex. There also appears to be a zone of stronger alteration in 
the (south) centre of the zone where abundant magnetite and mica (phlogopite) occur. 
Jervois assisted an Australian National University (CRC-LEME) student, Augustine 
Alorbi, with his Honours thesis titled 'The Geology and Geochemistry of the Miandetta 
Area near Nyngan, NSW' dated June 2006. 
 
The abstract of this work follows: 
 

"This study focuses on understanding the Geology and Geochemistry of the Miandetta area, near 

Nyngan New South Wales.   The regolith of the Miandetta region is extensive, deep and complex 

and by understanding the nature and origin of this material it is possible to establish whether 

contained elements are laterally transported or indicating underlying mineralization. 

 

Drill samples were assessed to understand the degree of geochemical dispersion of elements 

related to the underlying mineralization through the in situ and transported cover.   In order to 

achieve this, the cover was logged and mapped so as to determine the physical nature of the 

surficial and buried regolith.   This involved logging eleven holes in detail and interpreting over 

nine holes that had been previously logged by Dr K.G. McQueen.   Having established the physical 

nature of the regolith cover through the bedrock mapping and drill holes information combined 

with the regolith-landform mapping, construction of a schematic cross section of the Miandetta 

area helped to interpret the geological history and landscape evolution of the area.   Different 

components of the cover were analyzed by geochemical and mineralogical means (ICP-OES and 

XRD). 

 

Results from the different methods of analysis all highlighted the variation in cover type.   XRD 

results showed a decrease in quartz content between the sandy and clayey units and the 

geochemistry showed differences in element abundances suggesting that the different cover types 

have different provenances.   The geochemical study also indicated that there was some dispersion 

of elements related to mineralization vertically up the profile.   The sequential extraction shows 

that most of the target and pathfinder elements of interest in the Miandetta terrain are in the 

strongly bound state and biogeochemistry suggested that the plants were taking significant 

amounts of metal from the ground". 

 
8. Exploration 

8.1 Surveys and Investigations 

Previous drilling at Gilgai (outlined in 4.2) searching for platinum revealed a large 
buried laterite body over 1000x500 metres in area. The laterite at the Gilgai Resource, 
which is covered by a minimum of 15 metres of Quaternary alluvials, had been outlined 
in the late 1980's by previous explorers searching for platinum.   134 RAB holes (for 
6779 metres) and two diamond drill holes (each 250 metres deep) were drilled on the 
prospect.    Jervois discovered the presence of scandium at Gilgai from the assay results 
of five multi-element Neutron Activation Scans of drill core made by the previous 
explorers.    
 



 

NI43-101 Technical Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project 
Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 17 
 

Between 1999 and 2001, two traverses of RC drillholes exploring for nickel were drilled 
across the Gilgai area.   The sample pulps from these holes were obtained by Jervois and 
many of them were analyzed for scandium.  The results of these assays indicated that 
there was significant enrichment of scandium in the Gilgai laterite. 
 
In September 2005, as part of a regional aircore drilling programme, Jervois drilled 5 
holes (Na49 to Na53 inclusive) along an east-west fence line through the centre of the 
laterite body.   Results from this drilling confirmed that a major resource of scandium 
was present at Gilgai. 
 
All the 1 metre intervals were geologically logged and weighed and magnetic 
susceptibility readings taken.  Chip tray samples were prepared for each drillhole.   All 
intervals below the alluvial overburden were sampled and despatched for assay (except 
for two holes Na55 and Na89 which penetrated monzonite and sediments respectively).   
All sample residue, except alluvium, was transported to a shed in Nyngan and stored for 
use in future metallurgical testwork. 
 
8.2 Interpretation of the Exploration Information 

Table 10.5 shows all the significant scandium assay values by section and includes other 
previous holes that contribute to the resource figures. 
 

The drill intercepts include all lithologies and where the width is shown in brackets it 
indicates that there is internal waste (ie contains intervals with less than 100 ppm Sc) 
within the intercept. 
 
8.3 Statement 

Surveys and investigations carried out during 2006 (and subsequently) have been 
carried out by the issuer. 
 
9. Drilling 

The aircore drilling programme was performed by Competitive Drilling Services Pty. 
Ltd. of Blayney NSW. The rig used was a Schramm 450, hole diameter 3½ inches 
(89mm) and the compressor had a capacity of 350psi and 600cfm. Drilling commenced 
on 16th January 2006 and was completed on 9th February 2006 with a break of 6 days 
between 20th January and 27th January due to compressor breakdown. The 
programme entailed 2638 metres in 69 holes in 19 days of drilling (ie a drill rate of 3.6 
holes and 139 metres per day). Most of the delays encountered were caused by 
blockages in the head/take-off tube especially in gravel overburden. Except for 
occasional hard hematite (hole Na85 was abandoned due to hard hematitic ground), the 
laterite zone generally allowed good drilling and recovery. A hammer bit (4¾" = 
121mm diameter) was used in one hole (Na100) due to hard ground. 
 
After the completion of each hole, the hole was capped with a blast hole plug about 1 
metre down from the collar and backfilled. The hole's position was surveyed using a 
Garmin GPS12 XL instrument and a marker pin with drillhole number was placed in the 
collar location. At the end of the drilling programme, on 16th and 17th February 2006, 
Consulting Surveyors, Langford and Rowe of Dubbo completed a controlled survey of 
the drillhole collars using a Leica Differential (RTK and static) system. 
 



 

NI43-101 Technical Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project 
Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 18 
 

A subsequent 9 hole programme was completed in 2008 in order to obtain sample for 
research and development. All air core drilling was vertical – the lithotype intersection 
lengths are close to true 'stratigraphic' widths. 
 

10. Sampling Method and Approach 

10.1 Sampling Method 

The samples were collected through a cyclone mounted to the drilling rig, into large 
plastic bags. All of the 1 metre intervals were geologically logged by sieving material 
from the bags, and the bags weighed, and magnetic susceptibility readings taken on the 
bulk bags. Reference chip samples were taken for each drillhole. 1-2kg samples for 
analysis were collected from the one metre bulk bags using a metal scoop by hand, in to 
small plastic bags. The air was expelled from the bags, the tops folded down several 
times, and sealed with heavy-duty staples. All intervals below the alluvial overburden 
were sampled and despatched for assay (except for two holes NA55 and NA89 which 
penetrated monzonite and sediments respectively - in NA55 a bedrock sample was 
collected every 4 metres, and no samples were collected from NA89).  
 
The small plastic bags of samples were packed in to labelled larger plastic bags and 
transported to the Company's shed in Nyngan at the end of each day, and locked inside 
until the end of the drilling programme. Shortly after the end of the programme, these 
were loaded on to pallets, shrink-wrapped and sent to Australian Laboratory Services 
Pty. Ltd.'s ('ALS') facility in Orange by commercial road transport, a distance of 315km 
by road. 
 
Approximately a week after the completion of the drilling programme, concurrently 
with rehabilitation of the drill sites, all of the bulk samples, except those of alluvium or 
metasediments, were transported to the Company's shed for long-term secure storage.  
Location: Gilgai Resource  
Number: 69 drill holes 
Type: Air core/RC 
Spacing: 50m 
Size of area: 1000x500m = 500,000 sq/m. (50 hectares / 123.6 acres) 
 
At a later date Jervois personnel retrieved a limited number of the stored one metre 
bulk samples, and using a riffle splitter, split off new samples for analysis, to check 
against those samples collected by scoop. The scandium values for the split samples 
were very close to those of the scooped samples. 
 
10.2 Sampling or Recovery Methods Which Could Impact on Results 

Some sample recovery risk is inherent in all air drilling techniques, but the combination 
of available reverse-circulation drill tools, high air flows and a competent drill operator, 
resulted in acceptable recoveries. The weights of the bulk samples were generally in the 
range 11-15kgs, with occasional much lower and higher weights. 
 
In damp or wet stratigraphy (particularly the leached saprolite), sample weights often 
dropped below 10kgs, probably due to returns sticking to the internal walls of the rod 
string and the pipework leading to the cyclone, to the walls of the cyclone, and possibly 
in the drillhole behind the bit. The main effect of this is likely to be some 'smearing' 
(contamination) of assay values across subsequent sample intervals. However, it is 



 

NI43-101 Technical Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project 
Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 19 
 

considered that this is unlikely to have had a material effect on the overall grade of each 
lithology in the resource model. 
 

10.3 Interpretation 

The table below shows all the significant assay results for scandium by Section and 
includes some earlier holes that contribute to the resource figures. Results below do not 
include any from the 2008 programme. 
 
The drill intercepts include all lithologies and where the width is shown in brackets it 
indicates that there is internal waste (ie. contains intervals with less than 100 ppm Sc) 
within the intercept. 
 
10.4 Establishing Higher Grade 

The laterite in which the resource is located has the higher scandium grades within the 
limonite and saprolite intervals.  These intervals vary in thickness laterally and the 
grade also varies.   Ground water and below surface topography are suggested as 
significant in determining the grade of scandium.  All resource calculations are stated 
with a 100ppm lower cut off.   
 
10.5 Relevant Samples 

Refer to the table of significant intervals below (Table 10.5.1).  All widths are 
considered true as the holes were drilled vertically.

Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 20 
 

 
Table 10.5.1 

 
Widths shown in brackets indicate that there is a sample interval which contains less 
than 100ppm scandium within the intercept. 
 
11. Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 

None of the assay samples used to support the mineral resource estimate of this report 
were prepared for analysis by any employees or subcontract personnel of Jervois 
Mining Limited. The samples were prepared by: Australian Laboratory Services Pty. 
Ltd.,

11.1 Sample Preparation and Assaying Methods  

After delivery to ALS' facility in Orange, the pallets of samples were stored in their semi-
secure yard for several days, until they could be prepared. ALS dried all of the samples 
in metal trays, and then pulverised them in line with their PUL-23 protocol:- 
"A sample up to 3 kg is ground in a ring mill pulverizer using a standard low-chrome 
steel ring set. If the sample is > 3 kg, it is split prior to pulverizing and the remainder 
may be retained or discarded. Samples too coarse to be put directly into a pulverizing 
mill, or where the particle size needs to be reduced before a representative split can be 
taken are crushed and split prior to pulverizing. The remainder may be saved or 
dumped at the client's request." 
From the pulverised material, two 150g sub-samples were taken, and sent to ALS' head 
office facility in Brisbane.

The Brisbane laboratory analyzed the earliest batches of samples from the Gilgai project 
by technique OG-62 - a 0.4-0.5g aliquot of the sub-sample was subjected to a four-acid 
digestion, then analyzed for a range of elements (which included scandium) by 
Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy, with a lower detection limit 
for scandium of 1ppm. 
 
Most of the samples from the Gilgai resource area drilling were analyzed by Technique 
ME-MS62s, a single-element trace level method. A 0.25g aliquot of the sub-sample is 
digested in perchloric-nitric-hydrofluoric acid (regarded as a "near-total" 
decomposition), and the solution is analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass 
Spectrometry, with a lower detection limit for scandium of 1ppm and an upper limit of 
500ppm. 
 

Samples which gave ≥500ppm scandium were re-analyzed by technique ME-ICP61. This 
uses a four-acid ("near-total") digestion of a 0.25g aliquot, with Inductively Coupled 
Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy determination of scandium with a lower 
detection limit of 1ppm and an upper limit of 10,000ppm (1%). ALS' Brisbane 
laboratory is NATA-certified, and the Orange laboratory's certification process is 
underway. 
 
Jervois did not submit any standard samples with their batches of assay samples, due to 
the lack of commercially available standards for scandium at the time. As far as can be 
determined, no duplicate samples were submitted with the batches. 
 
A maximum value of 1,260ppm scandium was obtained from the assay samples. (Refer 
table 10.5 below).  
 
11.2 Data Quality 



 

NI43-101 Technical Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project 
Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 22 
 

The quality of the data is considered acceptable in precision as ALS operate with a 
rigorous system of internal standards and duplicates, and participate in regular round-
robin analyses of samples with other commercial laboratories world-wide.  
 
12. Data Verification  

12.1 Quality Control Measures and Procedures 

It is considered that confidence can be placed in the resource figures quoted in Table 
15.3.  The analysis of the samples was conducted by ALS Chemex, applying methods that 
Jervois has been using with confidence for some years after various check analyses in 
other laboratories. Assay checks have been done previously on laterite samples 
(predominantly from Jervois' nickel/cobalt laterite deposits at Young, NSW), comparing 
ALS Laboratories' values and Becquerel Laboratories'Neutron Activation assays at 
Lucas Heights, NSW,  and in Canada.  The assay results compared favourably. 
 
The drilling and sampling of the holes was supervised by the original author/s of this 
report and the sample recoveries, available on the drill log sheets, are all recorded. The 
densities of the four lithologies have been carefully analyzed and compared with 
Jervois' density figures for other laterite projects.  The results compare closely.   
 
The drill hole locations were surveyed using a Garmin GPS12 XL instrument and a 
marker pin inscribed with the drillhole number was placed in the collar. At the end of 
the drilling programme, Consulting Surveyors completed a controlled survey of the 
drillhole collars using a Differential GPS system. 
 
12.2 Limitations 

The database and information prepared on behalf of Jervois Mining Limited and verified 
by Max Rangott relies on the industry professionalism of information supplied by 
Anthony Jannink of Douglas McKenna and Partners, Duncan Pursell of Jervois Mining 
Limited and ALS Chemex Australia. No discrepancies were noted in the source data, 
indicating that Jervois Mining Limited has taken significant internal QA/QC while 
compiling it. 
 
The data has been assembled with utmost regards to accurate transfer and data entry.  
Max Rangott does not take responsibility for the quality of the source data. 
 
13. Adjacent Properties  

There are no materially significant adjacent properties. 
 
14. Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

The results and methodologies for processing and metallurgical testing are confidential.  
For details please contact Duncan Pursell, c/o Jervois Mining Limited.    
 
To provide material for metallurgical testwork, a 750kg (¾ tonne) dry weight bulk 
sample was prepared in 2006, by systematically compositing material (obtained from 
the stored one metre bulk drilling samples) derived from the imonitic laterite 
component of the Gilgai Measured Resource area. Approximately 43kg (equivalent to 
37-38kg dry weight) of that material was taken (as 8kg sub-samples) from the one 
metre bags from the intersected limonitic intervals, in 20 of the 37 holes drilled across 
the Measured Resource.

The bulk sample was carefully mixed, four small samples for determination of head 
grade were extracted, and the bulk sample was then packed in to four steel 44-gallon 
drums and sealed for road transport to Metcon Laboratories at Brookvale in Sydney, 
approximately 600 road km from Nyngan.

15.1 Sample Collection 

Collection and storage of samples from the drillout programme is described in section 
10.1 of this report. The analytical values obtained from that programme were used in 
the calculation of the resources. 
 
15.2 Significant Assay Results  

Table 10.5 of this report shows all of the significant scandium intersections by Section 
and includes some holes drilled by prior explorers which contribute to the resource 
figures. The figures do not include those from a confirmatory drilling programme 
carried out in 2008. The drill intercepts include all lithologies and are true widths.   
 
Fifteen elements were analyzed by ALS Chemex using the following methods: 
ME-ICP61s - up to 27 Elements by four acid ICPAES

15.3 Resource Calculations 

Intersection Lengths (for each regolith type) and their grades were obtained from the 
figures entered on the 2006 drillout programme logsheets (drillholes NA54 to NA121). 
The 2006 holes drilled across the deposit were at two spacings - 50 metres and 100 
metres. Selection of the area drilled at 50 metre spacings was based on low overburden 
thickness, scandium values for earlier holes obtained using a Niton portable analyser 
(which subsequently proved to be unreliable), and the visual quality of the limonite 
horizon of the regolith - information obtained from prior drill chip samples and drill 
logs. 
 
Classification of the regolith mineralization types, selection of the density and grade 
data and calculation of the resource figures were carried out by Mr Anthony Jannink, M. 
Arts, 1964 (Cambridge), F.AusIMM, a very experienced geologist who had evaluated a 
number of lateritic nickel-cobalt deposits in Australia, and who in 2006 was a director 
of Jervois. 
 
The 50 metre spaced drilling programme (25 metre sphere of influence for each hole) is 
considered to be sufficiently close spaced to justify the resources in that area to be 
classed as 'Measured' under the JORC Code 2004 guidelines. The remaining 100 metre 
spaced drilling resources have been labelled 'Indicated' and have a 50 metre zone of 
influence. No further resources outside this drilled pattern were considered for the 
resource calculation. 
 
The resources have been calculated by plan polygonal methods for each of the four 
resource lithologies - haematite, limonite, saprolite and weathered bedrock. To be 
included in the resource calculations, the sample intervals for each regolith category 
had to exceed 100ppm scandium in grade, and be at least 2 metres in thickness. The 
density figures used (Table 15.3.3) are based on corresponding weights of the samples 
produced from the drillholes and the assumed hole volume of 0.006207167 cubic 
metres per metre of hole drilled. Guidance has also been taken from Jervois' experience 
with other NSW laterites especially at their Young and Port Macquarie projects. At 
Young, densities were measured from diamond drill core and are shown as a 
comparison to those calculated for Gilgai. 
 
Samples that were obviously too large or too small or were wet/damp/contaminated 
were excluded from the calculations. The calculated density figures are shown on the 
following table and their weighted averages shown at the foot of the table. To obtain the 
lithotype densities adjustments were made by making moisture content corrections. 
The figures given in the table are those from the Company's Young laterite deposits. In 
recent metallurgical testwork at Metcon, Brookvale, NSW, the 15% figure for limonitic 
regolith was confirmed in the laboratory. 
 
The resultant calculated densities compared with the figures used at the nickel/cobalt 
laterite at Young are:

Young (Ni/Co) 2.0 1.7 1.8 2.1 

 
The figures used for the Gilgai lithologies were believed to be conservative. Overburden 
figures quoted in this report are indicative and not based on mine plan design. 
The resources were calculated by plan polygonal methods for each of the four regolith 
categories - haematitic, limonitic, saprolitic and bedrock. The volume of each block is 
the polygonal area times the drilled thickness for that category (see Plans NY-111, 112, 
113 and 148). 
 
The overburden volume was calculated as the polygonal plan area for each drillhole 
times the depth to top of mineralization. Internal waste was treated in the same way – 
polygonal plan area times the distance between upper and lower Mineralization 
boundaries. 
Using the above parameters, the resource figures below were calculated from the 
results:

Measured 2,718,000 274 0.81:1 

Indicated 9,294,000 258 1.40:1 

Total 12,012,000 261 1.10:1 
 
 

These resources are further defined in Tables 15.2 and 15.3, where the figures are given 
for all the elements assayed for each of the lithology categories. 
 
The resource to be first exploited will be the Limonite Measured Resource of 1.5 million 
tonnes at 330 ppm scandium.  This resource unit is the shallowest (overburden of 12-15 
metres) and richest. The resources are shown in Appendices 7 to 11 and Tables 15.2 
and 15.3. The plans show the location of the measured and indicated categories.

15.4 Parameters Affecting Reserves 

There are no relevant issues that would affect the mineral resources and mineral 
reserve estimations.     
 
16. Other Relevant Data and Information  

There is no other data or information which is relevant to this summary. 
 
17. Interpretation and Conclusions  

17.1 Exploration 

The January/February 2006 aircore drilling programme has successfully outlined both 
measured and indicated resources of scandium at Gilgai. The Limonite measured 
resource of 1.5 million tonnes at 330ppm scandium is considered to be economic 
(assuming reasonable metallurgical recovery) and could supply the present world 
demand for many years. 
 
It is considered that confidence can be placed in the resource figures quoted above.  
The drillhole locations have been accurately surveyed by professional surveyors. 
 
17.2 Sampling and Analytical Data 

The analysis of the samples was conducted by ALS Chemex applying methods that 
Jervois has been using with confidence for some years after various check analyses in 
other laboratories. 
 
The drilling and sampling of the holes was supervised by the author/s of this report and 
the sample recoveries, as shown on the drill log sheets, are all recorded as weights – 
they generally show excellent returns in the mineralised zones. The densities of the four 
lithologies have been carefully analyzed and compare well with Jervois' density figures 
for other laterite projects. 
 
17.3 Resource Estimation 

This report, with its appendices and plans, is specifically directed at producing a 
resource statement for the Gilgai Scandium Resource. To convert these resources into 
Ore Reserves requires further inputs from a number of different entities (mining, 
metallurgy, environmental, community etc).  The first stage of finding and proving a 
resource has been accomplished. 
 
Recent test work on the ore has yielded recoveries of greater than 90% scandium and 
this research is nearing completion. A ready market has already shown interest in 
scandium oxide to 99.9% purity. A future market for scandium is envisaged for use in 
fuel cell technology with an indicated initial demand of up to 10 tonnes per annum and 
increasing. To produce scandium oxide, a Resin-in Pulp plant would be required, with 
the objective of producing 99.9% material. 
 
Acquisition and purchase of a parcel of land on EL 6009 has been finalised and 
settlement has been completed. 
 
A concept mine plan has been prepared for the freehold land that has been purchased.

An Assessment Lease Application for the Gilgai (Nyngan) Tenements EL 6009, 6095 and 
6096 was lodged with the Department of Primary Industry in June 2008 and is 
currently pending. 
 

17.4 Conclusions of Qualified Person  

Jervois Mining's initial resource delineation work on the Gilgai Project was supervised 
and carried out by a small but very experienced and professional project team, to 
accepted industry standards. 
 
Sampling procedures at the site were commensurate with the quality of samples which 
can be produced by the type of drilling used (aircore), the method chosen being the 
most appropriate given cost, time and sample handling and storage considerations at 
that early stage. The physical properties of the materials which were sampled are likely 
to have varied significantly, making totally reliable sampling difficult. Security risk at 
the project site at the time is considered to have been very low. The samples taken for 
analysis were stored at the conclusion of each day's drilling in a secure environment, 
and transported by a commercial transport company in sealed bags, to the preparation 
laboratory in Orange, which the Qualified Person visits regularly. 
 
The commercial laboratory company used, which is a division of ALS Chemex, has a 
sound reputation in Australia for process integrity and quality control, and their 
Brisbane facility, where the analyses were carried out, is NATA-certified. 
 
The resource calculations presented in this report were carried out by standard 
procedures, and conservative figures have been adopted for key parameters. It is 
considered that the calculations should have produced reliable tonnage and grade 
estimates for the resource model. The Qualified Person has carried out spot-checks of 
Jervois' polygon density and grade calculations (using their comprehensive drill logs), 
confirming the original figures. 
 
Drilling of a number of PQ core holes or Vibracore holes to obtain more reliable density 
figures is warranted during the next phase of work at the site. The drill samples could 
also be used to further validate the grade of the resource lithological units, to assist the 
process of upgrading part of the resource to a reserve. 
 
The risk in using diamond coring for this work is that some of the softer components of 
the materials to be sampled may wash away during the drilling process. It is believed 
that the Vibracore technique can more reliably produce an undisturbed sample. 
 
18. Recommendations  

18.1 Recommended Work Programs 

Phase 1 Work Plan 
a)      Beginning June 2010 an extensive metallurgical program will be carried out to 
refine and/or modify the existing flow sheet for the recovery of the Scandium from the 
ore. It is anticipated that this program will be completed late 2010/early 2011. The 
budgeted expenditures for this program amount to approximately AUD $450,000 
 
b)      During the metallurgical program a small drill program should be carried out to 
better define the higher grade zone of the deposit, to collect sample for further 



 

NI43-101 Technical Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project 
Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 32 
 

technological work and to provide an avenue for water quality testing as required for 
the Environmental Impact Statement.  This drill program will consist of 4-6 holes for a 
total of approximately 250 meters. The drilling method will either air core or reverse 
circulation (RC) drilling. The budget for this program will be approximately AUD 
$50,000 
  
Phase 2 Work Plan 
Following successful completion of the Phase 1 work program, a feasibility study will be 
carried out. It is anticipated that this study might be completed in the latter half of 2011. 
The feasibility study will define the commercial viability of the project. It will include 
the following items: 
• A flow sheet  
• Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P & I Ds)  
• General Plant Layouts  
• An estimate of Capital Expenditures  
• An estimate of Operating Expenditures 
The budget estimated for this study is between AUD $350,000 and $500,000

20. Glossary 

20.1 Terms and Definitions 

Mineral Resource: The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified 
according to the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves, The JORC Code, 2004.   Accordingly, the Resources have 
been classified as Measured or Indicated.  
 
A 'Mineral Resource' is a concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic 
interest in or on the Earth's crust in such a form quantity and quality that there are 
reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristic and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. Mineral Resources are 
sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and 
Measured categories. '   
 
An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, 
densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated 
with a reasonable level of confidence.  It is based on exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits workings and drill holes.  The locations are too widely or inappropriately 
spaced to confirm geological and/or grade continuity but are spaced closely enough for 
continuity to be assumed. 
 
A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, 
densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated 
with a high level of confidence.  It is based on detailed and reliable exploration, 
sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits workings and drill holes.  The locations are 
spaced closely enough to confirm geological and/or grade continuity. 
 
Ore Reserve: An 'Ore Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured or 
Indicated Mineral Resource.  It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses 
which may occur when the material is mined.  Appropriate assessments, which may 
include feasibility studies, have been carried out and include consideration of and 
modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, social and governmental factors.  These assessments demonstrate at the 
time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified. Ore Reserves are sub-
divided in order of increasing confidence into 'Probable Ore Reserves' and 'Proved Ore 
Reserves'.  
 
A 'Proved Ore Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral 
Resource.  It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur 
when the material is mined.  Appropriate assessments, which may include feasibility 
studies, have been carried out and include consideration of and modification by 
realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors.  These assessments demonstrate at the time of 
reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified.    
 

Assay: The chemical analysis of mineral samples to determine the metal content.

Jervois Mining Limited Nyngan, New South Wales, Australia  Page 34 
 

Composite: Combining more than one sample result to give an average result over a 
larger distance. 
 
Exploration Licence: Granted title over a large area of land entitling the holder to 
explore for one or more mineral commodities for a set period of time. 
 
Grade: The measure of concentration of a substance within mineralized rock. 
 
Igneous: Primary crystalline rock formed by the solidification of magma. 
 
Lithological: Geological description pertaining to different rock types. 
 
Mineral/Mining Lease: A lease area for which mineral rights are held, and subject to 
conditions, there is guaranteed security of tenure.
