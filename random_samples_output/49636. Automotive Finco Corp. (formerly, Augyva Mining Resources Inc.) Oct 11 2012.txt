1.0 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

Met-Chem Canada Inc (Met-Chem) was retained in February 2012 by Century Iron 

Mines Corporation ("Century") to prepare an independent technical report on the updated 

mineral resources of the Duncan Lake Iron Project ("DLIP") in Quebec. Concurrently to 

this mandate, Met-Chem was also requested to prepare a Preliminary Economic 

Assessment (PEA) on the DLIP which is currently under way. 

The new resources estimates were warranted following Augyva Mining Resources Inc. 

("Augyva") and Century's 2011 and 2012 drilling campaign on the property of 

44,006.65 m of core in 125 drill holes since the 2010 initial resources estimate.  

This report documents the results of the resource estimates and constitutes a Technical 

Report under the guidelines of NI 43-101. The classification of the mineral resources is 

compliant with the CIM Definitions, in accordance with NI 43-101. 

The present technical report is issued jointly to Century and Augyva. 

1.2 Property Description and Ownership 

The DLIP is located approximately 570 km north of Matagami, Québec, within the 

Municipality of James Bay, along Highway 109. The property is 40 km south of Radisson 

and 1,350 road km to the N-NW of Montreal.  

The DLIP property consists of 534 contiguous claims covering 25,605 hectares. All the 

claims are registered under a combination of holders including Augyva and Century, and 

all were in good standing at the time of writing the present report.  

A tract of land controlled by Hydro Quebec truncates the claims along the center of most 

of the length of the property and forty-four claims carry encumbrances related to an 

electrode grounding system and/or a power line corridor. 

Although the DLIP lies in the northern part of the Province of Quebec, it is out of 

permafrost range and several Canadian mines are operated under harsher climatic 

conditions than the ones prevailing in the Radisson area. 

On May 20, 2008, Century entered into an Option and Joint Venture Agreement with 

Augyva to obtain a 51% interest in the Duncan Lake property. On November 10, 2010, 

Century exercised its option, after its funding commitment of $6.0 million, and currently 

holds a 51% interest in the DLIP. Century has an additional option to obtain a further 

14% of the property by spending an additional $14.0 million or completing a Pre-

Feasibility report on/before the eighth anniversary of the date of the Agreement. 

Century, with Head Offices in Toronto, Ontario, is partnering with state-owned Chinese 

companies, WISCO International Resources Development & Investment Limited and 

Minmetals Exploration & Development (Luxembourg) Limited S.àr.l. Augyva's Head 

Offices are located in Montreal, Quebec.

In 2005, Augyva acquired the DLIP from Virginia Mines Inc. ("Virginia"), to which a 

perpetual production royalty of $0.40 per ton of iron concentrate is payable, as well as a 

2% net smelter return (NSR) royalty on any metal other than iron. Augyva retained a 

buyback right to purchase 50% ($0.20 per ton of concentrate) of the royalty for a 

payment of $4 million, in addition to an option of buying back a further 20% royalty 

($0.08 per ton of concentrate) by paying $4 million and to purchase 50% of the NSR for 

$5 million.  

1.3 Geology and Mineralization 

The DLIP lies within the western part of the La Grande Sub-Province of the structural 

Superior Province. The La Grande Sub-Province is characterized by an Archean tonalitic 

basement (Langelier Complex) unconformably overlain by the volcano-sedimentary 

Guyer and Yasinski Groups composed of iron formation, wacke, paragneiss, basalt to 

dacite and pyroclastic units. The alluvial or fluvial sediments of the Ekomiak Formation 

partly lie on the Yasinski Group. The sediments of the Sakami Formation were deposited 

in NE-trending sedimentary basins. All these rocks are intruded by several plutons 

(Duncan Lake and Radisson plutons) and mafic to ultramafic intrusions and dikes. 

The Banded Iron Formation ("BIF") at Duncan Lake shares features characteristics of 

both the Superior Lake and Algoma types of iron formations. Regional metamorphism 

ranges from greenschist to amphibolite facies. The supracrustal rocks have been 

deformed by at least two structural events, forming a subvertical, N-S and a steeply 

south-dipping, E-NE trending schistosity, as well as folds and shear. 

The DLIP is underlain by two parallel N-NE BIF units traced across the entire property 

by their magnetic signature and by drilling. The mafic volcanic rocks dominate in the 

area of known BIF occurrence, but felsic rocks and possible basement prevail in the 

Deposit 6 sector.  

Deposits 1 and 2 are part of one continuous N-NE trending band traceable over about 

17 km and appear to join Deposits 3. They are separated by about 2 km from Deposit 5 

on the southeast. The northwestern branch of Deposit 3 is connected to Deposit 4 by one 

NE magnetic anomaly. Deposit 6 seems to be disconnected from the other ones. 

Deposit 3 is characterized by two main BIF units arranged as a large-scale, tight synform 

and antiform system. Stacking of BIF units by fault thrust is interpreted in most deposits.  

Iron mineralization within the DLIP property consists of alternating bands of quartz and 

magnetite, with only minor amounts of hematite. The DLIP deposits are also associated 

with silicate and sulphide facies iron formations. On average, the iron mineralization at 

DLIP contains 15 to 35% total Fe and very low levels of deleterious elements, except for 

elevated average sulphur content that probably originates from widespread pyrite 

disseminations.

1.4 Exploration, Development, Operations 

The first systematic exploration effort targeting the Duncan Lake iron mineralization 

since the discovery in 1949 consisted of an airborne magnetometer survey and 8 diamond 

drill holes completed in 1956. In 1973, 22 holes for 4,188m were drilled into deposits 3, 4 

and 6, but were disregarded in the present resource estimate, owing to insufficient 

documentation. The present resources estimate is based on the data from the diamond 

drilling programs of 2008-2009 (10,460.25 m) and 2011-2012 (44,006.65 m) into all six 

deposits.  Several ground magnetic surveys have been completed recently, since the 

method is an efficient tool to detect the BIF units.  

1.5 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

Two holes totaling 2,349 m of HQ core were drilled in 2011 into each of the Blocks 3, 4 

and 6 deposits to provide material for metallurgical testwork. 

The samples were subjected to whole-rock analysis and full ICP-scan. The JK drop-

weight, Bond Low-energy impact and Bond abrasion tests were performed on three 

composite samples. Sag Mill Comminution is being conducted on seven different 

lithologies as well as Bond rod mill and Bond ball mill grindability tests. Coarse cobbing 

is being tested with a dry magnetic drum.   

More than 400 samples submitted to Davis tube testing showed a weight recovery close 

to a quarter from the feed and indicated that most of the sulfur is recovered in the non-

magnetic tailings that might be acid-generating. Testing and data interpretation is under 

way. 

1.6 Mineral Resource Estimates 

The resources estimation completed on Deposits 3, 4 and 6 included the 2011-2012 drill 

data, whereas the resources for Deposits 1 and 2 were simply updated from the 2008-

2009 data.  

All the samples were submitted to XRF-Lithium Borate fusion for analysis of the major 

oxides, and selected samples had determination of sulphur and Loss on Ignition, ferrous 

iron titration, multi-element ICP-OES analysis and Davis Tube tests.  

A thorough QA-QC system using QC samples and secondary laboratories ensured proper 

monitoring of the laboratories performance. Several passes of verification ensured the 

reliability of all the data populating the master database. 

Estimation methodology was based on interpreting vertical cross-sections which were 

meshed into 3D solids and used to constrain inverse distance squared estimates within 6 

separate block models. Solids boundaries were defined by a combination of lithology and 

Fe grade. Regular 20 m x 10 m x 5 m block sizes were used for each of the block models. 

Search ellipses reflecting unique dips and strikes to the various fold limbs were used to 

constrain the interpolation. Assay sample lengths were composited to a nominal 3-m 

length for grade interpolation. Total head Fe, Davis Tube Weight Recovery, Fe% and

SiO2% in Davis Tube concentrates were modeled. A global density factor of 3.2 g/cc 

based on 3,107 determinations was assigned to the block models.  

The mineral resource estimate for Duncan Lake used 9,178 assays collected from 

54,467 m of drilling in 177 drill holes. The estimate also rested on a total of 843 Davis 

Tube samples.  

Mineral resources were classified based on search ellipse ranges and minimum number of 

informing composites. A Measured resource classification was assigned to blocks 

interpolated by a minimum of 12 composites and maximum search ellipse range of 300 m 

along the major axis, 150 m along the semi-major axis and 20 m along the minor axis. 

Indicated category was assigned to blocks interpolated by a minimum of 6 composites 

and maximum search ellipse range of 300 m along the major axis, 150 m along the semi-

major axis and 20 m along the minor axis. Inferred resource was assigned to blocks 

interpolated by a minimum of 3 composites and maximum search ellipse range of 450 m 

along the major axis, 225 m along the semi-major axis and 30 m along the minor axis. 

Mineral resources are reported to a cut-off of 16% Fe and are not constrained to a pit 

shell. A list of Mineral Resources is provided below.

Chem is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-

political, marketing or other issues that would materially affect the mineral resources. 

The quantity and grade of reported Inferred mineral resources in this estimate are 

uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define the Inferred 

mineral resources as Indicated or Measured mineral resources and it is uncertain if further 

exploration will result in upgrading them to Indicated or Measured mineral resource 

categories.  

The mineral resources are reported in accordance with Canadian Securities 

Administrators NI 43-101 and have been classified in accordance with standards as 

defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM"), "CIM 

Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves". Mineral resources 

which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  

No previous production has been reported for the DLIP, or on adjacent properties.

1.7 Environment 

No hydrometric stations have yet been established but initial data have been collected in 

three gauging stations in 2011 and 2012. One limnimeter in Esprit Lake and one in 

Desaulnier Lake have been collecting data since 2011. Groundwater samples were 

collected in 2011 and 2012 in the deposit area. Studies of the ecosystem and vegetation 

within the DLIP were also conducted in 2011. No soil contamination by oil or fuel was 

observed during a site visit by Le Groupe Desfor in August 2012.   

The DLIP is subject to the Québec Environmental Assessment Act and the Canadian 

Environmental Assessment Act. The former requires that large projects undergo an 

environmental assessment, including provisions for active participation of the First 

Nations, while the latter applies when a federal agency is required to make a decision on 

whether to issue authorizations that may include matters related to fish habitat or 

navigable waters. 

Met-Chem is not aware of any agreement under which aboriginal communities may hold 

title or historical agreement to the mineral land for the DLIP. Met-Chem is not aware of 

any environmental liabilities to which the DLIP is subject, and none is mentioned in the 

GESTIM management system for the DLIP. Century made sure all exploration programs 

on the DLIP have and will be conducted in an environmentally friendly manner. 

1.8 Conclusions, Recommendations 

Cumulatively, the drilling programs of 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 have allowed defining 

three quarters of the resources in Deposits 3, 4 and 6 in the Measured and Indicated 

categories, and updating the former estimate for Deposits 1, 2 and 5. 

The reliability of the results is ensured by thorough QA-QC system and several passes of 

verification and corrections in the master database, eventually leaving a reliable set of 

data.  

Met-Chem believes the number of available Davis Tube tests should be increased to 50% 

of the total sample population in order to generate a better estimate of the overall Davis 

Tube Weight Recovery of the DLIP mineralisation. 

Preliminary metallurgical and Davis Tube tests show the DLIP iron mineralisation to be 

composed mostly of magnetite and to contain very low levels of deleterious elements, 

except for elevated sulphur. Sulphur seems to report to the tails in the Davis Tube tests 

and its acid-generating potential is under study. 

Met-Chem believes the data collected on the DLIP are sufficiently reliable to support the 

present resources estimate and the ongoing Preliminary Economic Assessment. 

Provided the Preliminary Economic Assessment being completed by Met-Chem is 

positive, Met-Chem recommends advancing the project to the Pre-Feasibility stage. To 

that end, the reliability of certain parameters, and of parts of the mineral resources base, 

will require upgrading, which entails:

• Additional diamond drilling to: 

• Increase the percentage of Measured and Indicated category relative to the 

Inferred resources within Deposits 1 and 3; 

• Firm up the definition of the geometry of Deposit 3; 

• Investigate some of the magnetic anomalies near the main deposits (N-S 

anomalies of Deposits 3 and 6; branch off Deposit 4). 

• Increase the number of Davis Tube to provide a better estimation of the Weight 

Recovery for the deposits; 

• Use certified blank and commercial standards materials to monitor the laboratory 

performance; 

• Initiate geotechnical (pit walls), hydrogeological and hydrological studies; 

• Conduct additional metallurgical tests, such as: Detailed Mineralogy of Feed, 

Concentrate and Tailings, Grindability test to evaluate variability of the 

Mineralization, Bench scale testwork, Pilot Plant investigation, Tailings 

characterization, Static Thickening, Dynamic Thickening, Pulp Rheology, Vacuum 

Filtration, Pressure Filtration, Pellet Feed characterization. 

The cost to complete the proposed Pre-Feasibility Study is estimated at approximately 

$6,900,000.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Property Description and Location 

The Duncan Lake Iron Property ("DLIP") is located approximately 570 km north of 

Matagami, Québec, within the Municipality of James Bay (Figure 4.1). The property is 

40 km south of Radisson and 10 km south of La Grande Rivière regional airport. The 

DLIP lies 950 km to the N-NW of Montreal, as the crow flies.  

The property has an irregular, elongate shape, stretching over about 30 km along a NE-

SW direction (Figure 4.2). The property covers parts of NTS Sheets 33F05 and 33F12 

and fits between coordinates 307,395 m E and 334,346 m E, and 5,925,320 m N and 

5,944,962 m N in the UTM NAD 83, Zone 18 system. Different Blocks have been 

defined in the DLIP property to describe sectors containing Deposits 1 to 6 that extend 

over 28 km along a southwest to northeast direction (Figure 4.2).  

The DLIP property consists of one block made up of 534 contiguous claims covering 

25,605.38 hectares. An elongate rectangular tract of land controlled by Hydro Quebec 

truncates the claims along the center of most of the length of the property. 

All the claims were acquired as Map-Designated Claims ("CDC") and the information on 

them is accessible through the Register of Real and Immovable Mining Rights in Quebec 

via the GESTIM application of the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife 

("MNRF").  

The size of a claim is generally a cell measuring 30 seconds longitude by 30 seconds 

latitude. Within surveyed territory, the outline of a claim is the same as that of a land lot, 

or part of. The claims give the owner exclusive rights to explore for mineral substances, 

with a few exceptions like hydrocarbons, sand and gravel.  

Access to the claims is granted to carry out exploration work. However, the claim holder 

cannot enter land granted for non-mining purposes or land leased for mining surface 

mineral substances without permission from the current holder of these rights.  

The claims have a validity of two years and can be renewed indefinitely for two-year 

periods, under certain conditions, provided the required exploration work is completed, 

and fees are paid. The assessment work requirement increases at each renewal. Excess 

work on one claim may be spread to other continuous claims held by the same owner 

within an area of 4.5 km

from November 22, 2012 to April 24, 2014. In September 2012, 69 claims were still 

being processed by the MNRF for renewal. The registered excess assessment work 

amounted to $3,771.07, the required work to renew the claims was $162,040 and the 

required fees were $61,845. 

4.2 Legal Titles Holders 

Century Iron Mine Corporation was incorporated under the Canada Business Corporation 

Act on July 10, 2007, with Head Offices at Suite 602, 170 University Avenue, Toronto, 

Ontario. The Company has two key strategic partners in WISCO International Resources 

Development & Investment Limited and Minmetals Exploration & Development 

(Luxembourg) Limited S. àr. l. both state-owned Chinese companies. 

Augyva Mining Resources Inc. was incorporated under the Canada Business 

Corporations Act on December 5, 1986. Augyva's Head Offices are located at 1 Place 

Ville Marie, Suite 2500, Montreal, Quebec. The company is involved in the exploration 

of mineral properties located in the Province of Quebec, Canada. 

On May 20, 2008, Century entered into an Option and Joint Venture Agreement with 

Augyva Mining Resources Inc. (Augyva) to obtain a 51% interest in the Duncan Lake 

property. On November 10, 2010, Century exercised its option, after completing its 

funding commitment of $6 million, and currently holds a 51% interest in the property. 

Century has an additional option to obtain a further 14% of the Duncan Lake property by 

spending an aggregate of $14 million in exploration, construction and/or operating costs, 

or completing a Pre-Feasibility report on or before the eighth anniversary of the date of 

the Augyva Agreement. 

4.3 Legal Agreements 

The DLIP is subject to an agreement concluded with Virginia Mines Inc. ("Virginia") in 

February 2005. A perpetual production royalty of $0.40 per ton of iron concentrate is 



Century Iron Mines Corporation / Augyva Mining Resources Inc.  
43-101 Technical Report on the Mineral Resources of the Duncan Lake Iron Project Page 14

  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

payable to Virginia. In addition, a 2% net smelter return (NSR) royalty on any metal 

other than iron is to be paid to Virginia. 

Augyva retained a buyback right to purchase 50% ($0.20 per ton of concentrate) of the 

royalty for a payment of $4 million.  

Furthermore, Augyva was granted an option of buying back a further 20% royalty 

($0.08 per ton of concentrate) for an additional payment of $4 million. Any additional 

resource of iron mineralization identified on lands covered by any titles, in an area of 

1 kilometer surrounding the property, acquired before or after February 2005 is also 

subject to the royalty. Augyva has a buyback right to purchase 50% of the NSR 

(1% NSR) for a payment of $5 million.  

The property is located in an area ruled by the James Bay Convention, including 

aboriginal agreements for land use. The property is located in the Municipality of James 

Bay and should not be affected by specific land use Categories 1 or 2 as defined by James 

Bay Convention, which contained provisions such as exclusive land use by local 

aboriginal communities.  

Met-Chem is not aware of any agreement under which aboriginal communities may hold 

title or historical agreement to the mineral land for this project.  

4.4 Environmental Liabilities 

Met-Chem is not aware of any environmental liabilities to which the DLIP is subject. An 

active landfill exists on the property in the vicinity of Block 3. A complete environmental 

study is under way, in preparation for a planned preliminary assessment of the DLIP. 

4.5 Permits 

Permission from the current holder is required to access claims for non-mining purposes. 

This applies to Hydro-Quebec land adjacent to the Duncan Lake property used for 

grounding electrodes.  

A claim holder cannot erect or maintain a construction on lands in the public domain 

without obtaining a construction permit from the MRNF, unless such a construction is for 

temporary shelters made of pliable material over rigid supports that can be dismantled 

and transported.  

Exploration work including drilling, outcrop stripping, bulk sampling requires permitting 

from the MNRF. 

Met-Chem is unaware of any significant factors or risks that may affect access, title or the 

right or ability to perform work on the DLIP.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

The project area can readily be accessed via Highway 109 connecting Radisson to 

Matagami, Amos, and further south, to Highway 117, between Rouyn-Noranda and Val-

d'Or. The road is paved, well-maintained and ploughed in the winter. The distance from 

Montreal to the DLIP is about 1,350 km road.  

Radisson is served by the La Grande Rivière regional airport located 30 km to the S-SE 

that offers daily scheduled flights to Montreal, Rouyn and the northern communities. 

No access to the national railway system is available, the closest link being in Rouyn-

Noranda. The DLIP is situates approximately 150 km from the east deep water coastline 

of James Bay. 

Six main deposits have been recognized in different sectors within the property and are 

referred to as Blocks 1 to 6. Highway 109 crosses the property in N-NW direction, 

between Deposits 1, 2, and 5 to the west, and Deposits 3, 4 and 6 on the east (Figure 4.2). 

Deposits 1 and 5 are accessible via a gravel road off Highway 109 (at km 570) toward 

Duncan Lake. Access to Deposits 2, 3 and 6 that lie close to Highway 109, is provided by 

trails passable by ATV's. Deposit 4 can be reached through a gravel road connecting 

Highway 109 to Desaulniers Lake and the LG2 Reservoir, and westward along an ATV 

trail.  

5.2 Climate 

Radisson has a humid subarctic continental climate. Table 5.1 presents the statistics 

compiled by Environment Canada since 1971 on the climate in the La Grande area.

period of the year, yet the region is out of permafrost range. The prevailing winds stay 

relatively constant all year long, moving from west to south during part of the winter 

period.  

Climatic conditions do not support any commercial agriculture or farming activities. 

However, although the DLIP project lies in the northern part of the Province of Quebec, 

Canadian miners are experienced operating mines under even harsher climatic conditions 

than the ones prevailing in the Radisson area.  

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Radisson is the closest municipality to the DLIP Project and was founded in 1974 to 

provide housing and to support development of the La Grande hydroelectric complex.  

Over the years, the population of Radisson has fluctuated according to the needs of the 

large construction sites in the area. The population of Radisson reached 2,500 persons 

toward the end of the 1970's, and was at 270 in 2011 (Statistics Canada, 2012). 

Services such as accommodation, hospital, car rental agencies, helicopter or float planes 

chartering, contractors with heavy machinery can be found in Radisson. La Grande 

Rivière Airport is used to shuttle Hydro-Québec personnel between Radisson and the 

larger cities in Quebec, but it is also served by daily scheduled flights. 

The closest aboriginal communities are Chisasibi and Weminji located respectively to the 

northwest and southwest, near the James Bay shore. Chisasibi is connected by paved road 

on 90 km from Highway 109 with modern facilities for a population estimated at 

4,000 residents. Weminji has 2,500 residents and is connected by a gravel road branching 

off Highway 109 at Km 518. 

Personnel for a mining operation can be found locally, but most hired labour will require 

training and highly skilled professionals will probably have to be sourced from cities in 

the South. 

Two power lines skirt the edge of Block 3 and cross the corner of Block 2 of the Duncan 

Lake project (Figure 4.2). Water supply is abundant, considering all the lakes within, or 

adjacent to, the property. 

A preliminary study performed at that stage shows that the property is likely to be 

sufficiently vast to accommodate the needs for the infrastructures required for a potential 

mining operation, such as surface stockpiles, tailings storage area, processing plant and 

buildings. 

5.4 Topography, Physiography and Vegetation 

The topography of DLIP is characterized by low relief with a NE grain marked by 

elongate, low rocky hills, glacial till and low-lying swampy areas. Relief on the property 

ranges from elevations 140 m to 182 m (AMSL), with Duncan Lake at 139 m and 

Desaulniers Lake at an elevation of 152 m (AMSL).

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

The iron formations do not have a positive topographic surface expression. Scarce 

outcrops are found over Deposits 1, 2, 3, and 5 and fewer yet on Deposits 4 and 6. A fair 

proportion of the property is covered by bodies of water, including the two large Duncan 

and Desaulniers Lakes.  

Vegetation in the area is characterized by stunted black spruce and jack pine 

accompanied by less frequent tamarack. Birch, poplar and alder are common along 

streams and lake shores, and in areas affected by forest-fires. Caribou-moss, shrubs, 

berries are common, lichen is ubiquitous. The area was never logged in the past and is not 

considered for mature commercial wood.  

Beaver, otter, muskrat, marten, lynx and wolf are present in the area, as well as black 

bears and moose. Sizable populations of seagulls, partridges, geese, black ducks, blue 

jays and sparrows are also living in the region. Pike and walleye abound in the lakes and 

streams of the area, and speckled trout are caught in small lakes. Whitefish and carp are 

found in some lakes which are connected to the La Grande Rivière and sturgeon is 

reported in La Grande Rivière. Duncan and Desaulniers Lakes are used for recreational 

fishing activities.

6.0 HISTORY 

6.1 Prior Ownership 

Duncan Range Iron Mines was created in 1957 and acquired the Duncan Lake Property. 

An agreement was reached with International Mogul Mines Ltd for a five-year period but 

the relationship between the two is unknown. Augyva acquired the DLIP property from 

Virginia Mines Inc. in 2005. 

6.2 Exploration Work 

Although the Geological Survey of Canada ("GSC") was active in the area, the discovery 

of iron formation around Duncan Lake in 1949 is attributed to a group of prospectors. 

The same prospectors returned to the region in 1953, as interest increased in beneficiation 

of magnetic iron formation (taconite). A property was staked and a magnetic survey over 

12 km of strike length was completed. 

A large amount of work has been completed in the area by mining companies, 

Universities and government agencies. The main focus of the exploration efforts in the 

region has been directed at iron formation, but chrome and platinum group elements 

(PGE), uranium, gold and copper mineralisation have also been targeted. 

Table 6.1 provides a summary of the exploration work most pertinent to the Duncan Lake 

project. Additional information can be found in the previously filed Technical Report NI 

43-101 on the Mineral Resources of the Duncan Lake Iron Project, dated

Resources Estimate 

 

The holes drilled by Augyva and Century since 2008 form the foundation of the present 

construction of the 3D model and of the resource estimate. 

6.3 Historical Mineral Resources 

Mineral resources estimations were completed in 1958, 1973 and 1976. However, these 

historical resources are non-compliant with the NI 43-101 rule, are outdated and the 

details on the methodology used and the investigated area are lacking. Met-Chem's 

opinion is that they are irrelevant for the purpose of this report, are superseded by the 

current estimate and, consequently, they will not be discussed. Met-Chem estimated NI 

43-101 compliant resources in 2010, but these are superseded by the present updated 

resource estimate. 

6.4 Production 

No production of iron mineralization has been reported from the Duncan Lake property.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

All geological information in this chapter is drawn from public documents prepared by 

University, Government Agencies or mining companies, as well as from the previously 

filed Technical Report by Met-Chem (2010) which contains additional geological 

descriptions. 

The DLIP lies within the Western Part of the La Grande Sub-Province of the structural 

Superior Province. The La Grande Sub-Province lies between the Opinaca Sub-Province 

to the E and SE and is separated from the Bienville Sub-Province to the north by a W-

NW fault (Figure 7.1). 

The La Grande Sub-Province is characterized by an Archean tonalitic gneiss basement 

and tonalite associated with the multi-phase Langelier Complex. The Langelier Complex 

is uncomfortably overlain by the volcano-sedimentary Guyer and Yasinski Groups 

composed of iron formation, wacke, paragneiss, basalt to dacite and pyroclastic units. 

The alluvial or fluvial sediments of the Ekomiak Formation partly lie on the Yasinski 

Group. The sediments of the Sakami Formation were deposited in NE-trending 

sedimentary basins.  

All these rocks are intruded by several syn- to late-tectonic plutons and some ultramafic 

intrusions and diabase dikes. The Duncan Lake and the Radisson Plutons are the most 

important in the region of the DLIP property.  

The range of regional metamorphism varies from greenschist to amphibolite facies. The 

supracrustal rocks have been deformed by at least two structural events, an early one 

forming a subvertical, N-S penetrative schistosity followed by a dominant event resulting 

in a steeply south-dipping, E-NE trending schistosity. Folding and intense shearing 

developed along an E-NE trend.

7.2 Property Geology 

7.2.1 General 

The DLIP property is underlain by two parallel BIF units cutting across the entire 

property in a north easterly direction (Figure 4.2). The mafic volcanic rocks dominate in 

the area of known BIF presence, but the felsic material, intrusive rocks and possible 

basement prevails in the Deposit 6 sector. All the mapped or interpreted lithological units 

are elongate and trend N-NE. 

The maps by G. Ivanov, IOS' geologist, show the area of Deposit 3 to be hosting BIF and 

basalt with subordinate amount of discontinuous, elongate felsic intrusive bodies. The 

Deposit 6 map shows bands of BIF interspersed with felsic material, one band of basalt 

along the full length of the Deposit area on the SE and a wide band of gneiss / felsic 

rocks along the length of the SE boundary of the drilled area. Deposit 4 is characterized 

by a central BIF unit, crossed along its central portion by a long greywacke horizon. 

Basalt underlies the NW portion of the area, whereas elongate basalt and felsic bodies 

occur on the SE. 

The attitude of the bedding and schistosity measured by G. Ivanov is universally steep, 

sub-vertical in the area of Deposits 3 and 6, ranging from 65 to 90° over Deposit 4. 

The mafic volcanic and sedimentary rocks in the DLIP area have undergone some degree 

of alteration, shearing, folding and regional metamorphism. The iron formations are 

typical BIF type with alternating 1 to 10 mm magnetite and silica beds.   

The intrusive series vary in composition from granite to hornblende gabbro emplaced as 

dykes or sills. The volcanic assemblage is assumed to be on the top of the rock sequence. 

However, volcanic rocks are located at different levels and on each side of the BIF units. 

7.2.2 Description of the Deposits 

The arrangement of the DLIP deposits is well displayed on the magnetic maps. Two sub-

parallel, north easterly trending bands forming Deposits 1-2 on the northwest are 

separated by about 1.8km from Deposit 5 on the southeast and appear to join Deposits 3. 

The northwestern branch of Deposit 3 is connected to Deposit 4 by one NE magnetic 

anomaly exhibiting a sharp curve at the NE end to meet the center of the NE trending 

Deposit 4. Deposit 6 seems to be disconnected from the other ones and is made up of a 

NE anomaly with an N-NE branch to the southwest. 

Deposits 1 and 2 are part of one continuous N-NE trending band traceable over about 

17 km, including the portion crossing the block excluded from exploration for Hydro-

Quebec's use.  

Deposit 1 consists of two main sub-parallel, en-echelon, 60 to 130 m thick BIF separated 

by 70 to 80m of greywacke. Those BIF have an open sigmoidal shape with a general 

strike of N230° and dips at -70° to the northwest. A 50-m wide gabbro dyke oriented 

N320° cross-cuts all rock units. Deposit 1 can be traced over more than 5.5 km along the 



Century Iron Mines Corporation / Augyva Mining Resources Inc.  
43-101 Technical Report on the Mineral Resources of the Duncan Lake Iron Project  Page 23 

  October 2012 
  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

strike, the northeastern 2.5 km of which are inside the block excluded from exploration 

for Hydro-Quebec's use. Thirty-one boreholes were drilled on this deposit in 2008-2009 

by Augyva. 3D modelling and a resource estimate were completed after this drilling 

program and no additional drilling has been completed on this deposit since. 

Deposit 2 is a single BIF unit expressed by a weak magnetic anomaly containing a series 

of isolated peaks, the highest two of which were drilled and correspond to an increase in 

thickness of the BIF. The BIF units are generally narrow but locally reach widths of 30 to 

70 m. Deposit 2 strikes N225 and dips at 80 to 85 toward the northwest. The core 

descriptions indicate that the BIF is accompanied with mafic volcanic units, sediments, 

felsic dykes and sills. Interpretation on six sections from only seven boreholes drilled in 

2009 by Augyva shows that three iron lenses are present. A resource estimate was 

performed by Met-Chem after the 2008-2009 drilling program (Technical Report of 

February 2010). No additional drilling or interpretation was done on this deposit since.  

Deposit 5 is a 4-km long, slightly arcuate, 25 m thick BIF unit located to the southeast of 

Deposits 1 and 2. The general strike of Deposit 5 is N225 and the dip is at 60 to the 

northwest. Its possible southwestern extension is undetermined. The magnetic anomaly 

show at least two peaks (highs). Six boreholes drilled in 2009 indicate a true thickness of 

5 to 25 m on the northern lens (magnetic anomaly), whereas the southern lens does not 

outcrop and was not drilled. A resource estimate was performed by Met-Chem after the 

2008-2009 drilling program (Technical Report of February 2010). No additional drilling 

or interpretation was done on this deposit since. 

Deposit 3 is a complexly folded BIF best described by its magnetic expression as a large 

V-shaped anomaly around a northeast axis and a smaller V-shaped anomaly with a 

northwesterly oriented bisector affecting the southeastern limb of the major structure. 

Drilling has shown two main BIF units arranged as a large-scale, tight synform (on the 

northwest) and antiform (on the southeast) system, with a shallow plunge to the northeast 

and steeply northwesterly dipping axial planes. A few BIF units intersected by drilling 

over parts of the deposits to the northwest of the main BIF units are interpreted to be in 

fault contacts and to have been thrust against the main units and added by stacking.  

The northern flank of the synform is oriented N030°/-75°SE, generally 150 to 250 m 

thick, formed by two to three BIF units. The south limb of the synform is oriented 

N250°/-70°NW and is about 50 to 75 m thick. The southern flank of the antiform, 

oriented N050°/-55°SE, is generally 50 to 150 m thick and is composed of one or two 

BIF units. The limb of the syncline on the southeast leaves the system open at depth. 

A late decametric to pluri-decametric granitic dyke has been identified in the present 

mapping and drilling campaign. Its strike is sub-parallel to the axial plane of the synform 

and crosses the nose of the synform in its southwestern portion. Its dip has not been 

clearly defined because of lack of drilling in its extension at depth.  

More drilling is needed to define the geometry of the sector at the northeastern end of the 

southern flank of the antiform where an N-S BIF unit occurs. The holes drilled during the 



Century Iron Mines Corporation / Augyva Mining Resources Inc.

  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

2011-2012 campaign led to a complete reinterpretation of the deposit and to a new 

resource estimate described in the present report. 

Deposit 4 is located about 5 km to the northeast of Deposit 3. It is 2.5 km long and 

consists of stacked BIF lenses 20 to 150 m thick, forming two clusters separated by 50 to 

60 m of sediments. Volcanic and granitic intrusions are found above and under the BIF, 

potentially due to isoclinal folding. On the thickest section, the total width of six adjacent 

BIF and felsic rocks units approaches 450 m. The deposit is generally oriented N050° and 

dips 60 to 70° to the southeast. The holes drilled during the 2011-2012 campaign led to a 

complete reinterpretation of the deposit and to a new resource estimate. 

Deposit 6 is located 1 km due east of Deposit 3. It is estimated to be 1.5 km long 

according to the magnetic data, including the southwestern most half-kilometer that falls 

into the block restricted from exploration and therefore has not been drilled. The general 

strike direction is N065° and the dip is sub-vertical to steep to the southeast. One striking 

feature of Deposit 6 is the high proportion of felsic intrusive rocks accompanying the 

BIF, as compared to the other deposits. Indeed, Deposit 6 is heavily invaded and dilated 

by late granitic intrusions, part of which will probably represent internal dilution. The 

width of the BIF-Granite zone is highly variable, ranging from 50 to 500 m. A few mafic 

dykes sub-parallel to the BIF have been observed in the middle of the deposit but the 

relation between the two was not clearly established. The holes drilled in 2011-2012 led 

to a complete reinterpretation and to a resource estimate described in the present report. 

Except for Deposit 3 that is characterized by complex folds, the other deposits show 

essentially tabular, parallel BIF units, with various degrees of felsic intrusions and 

proportions of interbedded mafic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Deposits 3, 4, and 6 are 

closely associated with granitic basement and contain more sills and dykes. 

A more detailed description of this deposit can be found in Met-Chem's previously filed 

Technical Report by Met-Chem (February 2010). 

7.2.3 Lithology 

a) Banded Iron Formation (BIF) 

BIF units are observed at various levels within the sequence of altered mafic 

volcanic and volcano-clastic rocks. Three types of BIF are observed: 

• Oxide BIF composed of magnetite-rich bands alternating with quartz-rich 

bands. 

• Silicate BIF composed of magnetite-rich bands alternating with iron silicate 

bands including chlorite, actinolite, diopside, and hornblende as well as free 

silica and biotite. 

• Lean BIF or low-grade iron units associated with greywacke. The lean BIF 

commonly contains silicate minerals and magnetite bands or disseminations. 



Century Iron Mines Corporation / Augyva Mining Resources Inc.

  October 2012 
  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

Quartz (chert) and magnetite are the main constituents of the BIF. Hematite was not 

observed in the core but is present. The thickness of the iron beds varies from 1 to 

10mm but is generally in a 2-5 mm range. The sulphides are represented by pyrite 

and traces of pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite.  

b) Basalt and Intermediate to Mafic Tuff 

Mafic volcanic rocks are represented mainly by altered and locally sheared basalt 

and intermediate to mafic tuff. The basalt is usually massive and locally occurs as 

an amphibolite with garnet and biotite. The pillow basalt variety is amygdaloidal, 

of dacitic and andesitic composition, is stretched and interdigitated with tuff and 

sediment, and locally host magnetite bands or disseminations.  

c) Quartzite and Greywacke 

The greywacke is light to dark grey, fine- to medium-grained, composed of sand 

size grains set in a fine greenish chlorite mudstone matrix, with garnet-rich bands. 

The greywacke exhibits laminae of quartz 1 to 5 mm thick, alternating with darker, 

1 to 3 mm biotitic bands. This unit is closely associated with the quartzite generally 

located at the base of the iron formation sequence. 

d) Dykes and Sills 

Intrusive rocks include gabbro, monzodiorite, granite, and syenite, feldspar 

porphyry sills and dykes. Late diabase dykes were mapped on outcrops at Deposit 

1. The feldspar porphyry units are probably part of Amisech Wat Pluton, which 

consists of tonalitic porphyry and appears to be part of the youngest Archean 

intrusion in the area.  

7.2.4 Mineralization 

Iron mineralization within the DLIP property consists of BIF type represented by 

alternating millimetric to centrimetric bands of quartz and of magnetite with minor 

amounts of hematite. The DLIP deposits are also associated with silicate and sulphide 

facies iron formations. The silicates consist mainly of actinolite, tremolite, diopside, 

grunerite, hornblende, chlorite, epidote, biotite, as well as chlorite-rich mudrocks. 

The BIF is black to dark blue and becomes dark-green with increased silicate content. It 

is generally fine-grained, with local variations due to recrystallization in response to 

contact metamorphism by the felsic intrusions near Deposits 3 and 6. Average head grade 

varies from 15 to 35% total Fe. 

Disseminated sulphides, mostly pyrite, are widespread in the BIF sequence and some of 

the adjacent waste rocks and represent the main contribution in the sulphur deleterious 

element to the system. 

The chemical analysis established that, on average, the iron formation at DLIP contains 

very low levels of deleterious elements, in particular phosphorus (0.02% P2O5), 

manganese (0.03% MnO) and magnesium (0.23% MgO). However, the average sulphur

  October 2012 
  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

content is elevated. The unweight average of 3,662 analyses for all deposits yielded 

0.78% S in the head grade from core samples.  

The sequence of the iron-rich units on the DLIP is not clearly defined and is related to a 

mix of Algoma and Lake Superior types BIF.  

7.2.5 Structure  

The rocks of the DLIP property area have been affected by at least two regional tectonic 

events, an early one forming a sub-vertical, N-S, penetrative schistosity followed by a 

dominant event resulting in a steeply south-dipping, E-NE trending schistosity. 

The general E-NE trend is reflected by the general arrangement of the 6 deposits and the 

axial plane of the main folds of Deposit 3. The N-S trend of parts of the BIF of Deposits 

3 and 6 may be relicts of the N-S tectonic event.  

Deposit 3 is characterized by tight folds. Evidence of addition of BIF units by stacking 

was found, particularly in deposits 3 and 6. Fold repetition of BIF units may also have 

occurred locally by isoclinal folding but this has not been well documented during the 

drilling and mapping activities. 

The understanding of the structural elements on the DLIP property is restricted by the 

general scarcity of outcrops and largely relies on drill hole and magnetic survey data.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The stratiform, iron-rich deposits in the world are classified as Lake Superior and 

Algoma types banded iron formations (BIF). The BIF are interpreted as finely bedded 

sedimentary rocks of chemical origin. 

The Canadian Lake Superior-type iron formations are the most important source of iron, 

followed by the deposits of Algoma-type iron formations. Algoma-type iron formations 

are predominantly found in Archean greenstone belts, while the Lake Superior type is 

generally of Paleoproterozoic age.  

The Lake Superior type of iron formation formed in stable continental shelf and platform 

settings, whereas the Algoma type is associated with volcanic arcs (tectonically active 

environment, greenstone belts) or rift zones and related volcanism. However, a complete 

gradation exists from one type to the other, as the Algoma type iron formation can be 

deposited at considerable distances from the volcanic centres. 

The Algoma deposits are interbedded with felsic to ultramafic volcanic and volcaniclastic 

rocks, greywacke, black shale, argillite and chert. The Lake Superior iron formation is 

associated with a variety of shallow marine sedimentary rocks including quartzite, shale 

and carbonate rocks, and subordinate amounts of felsic to mafic volcanic rocks. 

The Lake Superior type, formed on the large areal extents of the platforms, typically have 

higher lateral continuity and thickness than the Algoma type BIF originating from the 

more restricted volcanic environment. 

The DLIP hosts iron deposits typical of the Algoma type oxide facies, considering the 

presence of an important volcanic rocks component. However, the large extent of the BIF 

in the DLIP deposits suggests a setting of deposition in a relatively stable environment. 

Consequently, the Duncan Lake BIF is interpreted to represent a type half-way between 

the Algoma and Superior types, sometimes referred to as Carajas iron mineralization. The 

oxide, silicate, carbonate and sulphide facies are common to both of these groups that 

contain a minimum of 15% Fe that typically varies between 30 and 35% Fe. 

Banded iron formation consists of thin alternating beds of silica (quartz, chert) and iron 

oxides (magnetite and hematite), with variable amounts of silicate, carbonate and 

sulphides. The sequences are commonly metamorphosed. Grain size varies according to 

the degree of metamorphism and iron amphiboles are commonly developed in middle 

greenschist or higher metamorphic grade rocks. 

The model used to design the exploration and drilling activities on the DLIP 

mineralization is based on the classification of the mineralization as large, Algoma type 

BIF deposits rich in magnetite. The definition of the deposits heavily relies on the large 

amount of available drill data, complemented with the results from field mapping, 

airborne and ground magnetometer surveys. The sheer extent of this type of deposits and 

their magnetic signature facilitates the design of drill programs.

9.0 EXPLORATION  

A wealth of geoscientific data has been generated in the region of the DLIP property, 

since the discovery of the DLIP deposits in 1949, principally by mapping, geophysical 

surveying and preliminary metallurgical testing completed by the Ministry of Natural 

Resources, research bodies and mining companies. 

Recently, compilation and re-interpretation of existing geophysical data, as well as 

several ground magnetic surveys, mostly aimed at filling in the gaps between existing 

grids, have been completed by Augyva and Century. Joël Simard, Geo., Geophysicist, 

was largely involved in the field activities, compilation and data analysis. The BIF have a 

distinct high magnetic signature which makes them stand out from the country rocks. 

Gennady Ivanov, geologist with IOS, completed field mapping over deposits 3, 4 and 6. 

Two maps were generated by IOS in May 2012. 

Laser radar (LIDAR) survey was flown over the Duncan Lake Project by XEOS Imaging 

Inc., Quebec City, on June 27 and 28, 2012. An Optech ALTM Gemini mapping system 

was used and the flights were completed at two different altitudes. The data was being 

processed at the time of writing this report. The high precision maps this survey will 

generate will be used for infrastructure design but is not expected to significantly help 

exploration or definition work of the DLIP deposits.

10.0 DRILLING 

10.1 Historical Drill Program (1973) 

The first well-documented diamond drilling program was completed in 1973 under 

Duncan Range Iron Mines exploration period, in association with International Mogul 

Mines Limited. Twenty-two (22) boreholes were completed for 4,141.54 m of AXT core 

into Deposits 3, 4 and 6. 

However, the results from this drilling program were not included in the current 

geological model, because of the uncertainties related to the exact hole location, the 

unavailability of the core and the lack of details on the analytical procedures,. 

In addition, the holes drilled in 2011-2012 were predominantly infill holes to the 1973 

and 2008-2009 program, or adjacent to most of the 1973 holes, which reduced the 

necessity of using the data from 1973. 

10.2 2008-2009 Drill Program  

This drilling program was initiated in July 14, 2008, stopped for Christmas in mid-

December, re-started in January 2009 and ended in May 2009. The drilling was 

conducted by Forage Baie James Inc. of Radisson, Quebec, using one diamond drill rig 

(model EF-50). A total of fifty-two boreholes for 10,461.4 m of NQ-sized core were 

drilled on all but Deposit 6 of the DLIP. 

The core was logged onto paper sheets and the records were later entered into Microsoft 

Excel files. Photographic records, Rock Quality Designation (RQD) and Core Recovery 

(REC) values were included in the logs. Average core recovery was reported as 

approaching 98%. 

Magnetic susceptibility measurements performed on the core of thirteen diamond drill 

holes did not provide much additional information on the mineralization and different 

rock types than can be gained by visual examination. 

6,489.6 m of core were sampled and analysed by ALS-Chemex Laboratory, in addition to 

the duplicates, standards and blanks inserted as QC samples to monitor the laboratory 

performance. In addition, 218 samples were sent to COREM for metallurgical testing. 

Nominal samples length was about 3 m for the first 22 boreholes and 5 m for the rest. 

The core was cut in half using a diamond saw and hydraulic splitters. 

Details on the 2008-2009 drill program are provided in the previously filed Technical 

Report by Met-Chem (2010). 

10.3 2011-2012 Drill Program  

A drill program of 44,006.65 m of core in 125 holes was completed between  

January 27, 2011 and March 22, 2012 (Table 10.1). The holes were drilled into the 

deposits of Blocks 3, 4 and 6 at angles between -90° to -50°, toward the NE or the SW, 

on the section lines, and to depths ranging from 120 m to 624 m.

The main purpose of this drill program was to better define the geometry of the Deposits, 

delineate additional tonnages of resources and increase the confidence level of the 

resources to be used in the resources estimate and a Preliminary Economic Assessment of 

the project. 

Three drill rigs equipped to retrieve NQ size core were active in 2011 and two were used 

in 2012. The drilling contractor in 2011 was DJM Drilling Inc. of Rouyn-Noranda 

operating two of its rigs, as well as one owned by Century. In 2012, drilling was 

completed by Orbit Garant Drilling Inc. of Val-d'Or, Quebec, with two drill rigs. 

Two holes were drilled into each of the Blocks 3, 4 and 6 deposits primarily to provide 

material for metallurgical testing (Table 10.2). These holes were drilled in HQ-sized core 

and had been designed to serve the needs of deposit definition and sampling, in addition 

to those of the metallurgical testwork.

Core logging was done directly by IOS geologists into the dedicated software GeoticLog. 

Photographic records, Rock Quality Designation (RQD), Core Recovery and magnetic 

susceptibility were recorded, in addition to the lithologies (main units and sub-units), 

mineralization, alteration, structure. 

7,689 samples representing 22,148.65 m of core were sampled, in addition to the 

duplicates, standards and blanks inserted as QC samples to monitor the laboratory 

performance. Nominal samples length was 3 m, but ranged from 1.5 m to 4.5 m in order

to honour the main lithological contacts. The core was cut in half using a diamond saw 

and hydraulic splitters. 

All the collars were surveyed with a DGPS and the downhole deviation was measured 

using a gyroscopic instrument. 

The field activities related to drilling and mapping were implemented and supervised by 

IOS, until the last day of drilling in March 2012. 

The true thickness of the iron lenses relative to the core lengths varies as the holes 

intersected the mineralized zones at different angles.  

No drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and 

reliability of the results were observed by Met-Chem in this drill program. The DGPS 

survey of all the hole collars and the use of a gyroscope instrument to measure the hole 

deviation provide accurate location of the holes in the deposits. 

Met-Chem believes the density of drilling is adequate to have delineated the geometry 

and grade of the mineralization with sufficient precision to be used in a resource estimate.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

11.1 1973 Drill Program 

Essentially, all is known about the samples from the 1973 drill program is the fact that 

the iron was analysed by titration of soluble iron. The results from this drill program were 

not incorporated into the present geological model. 

11.2 2008-2009 Drill Program 

11.2.1 Sampling, Analysis 

The geologists from Augyva and Century marked the sample intervals on the core and a 

line along which to split it. Core splitting was done at the core storage area in Radisson 

using both hydraulic splitters and diamond blade saws. One half of the core was placed 

back in the boxes, along the original orientation and position, the other half was inserted 

into a plastic bag with a tag for identification. Nominal samples length was about 3 m for 

the first 22 holes and 5 m for the rest. 

The samples were delivered in thick polypropylene bags to ALS-Chemex Laboratory, in 

Val-d'Or for preparation and analysis. The samples were analysed for major oxides via 

XRF and sulphur in a Leco furnace. 

At the laboratory, the samples are reduced to ¼ inch with a jaw crusher, cleaned with 

compressed air between each sample and with barren material between the sample 

batches. The samples are then reduced to 90% passing 10 mesh with a roll crusher 

cleaned between samples with a wire brush, compressed air, and with barren material 

between sample batches. 

The first sample of each sample batch is screened to ensure that 90% passes 10 mesh. 

The mass of the samples is then reduced to about 300 g using a Jones riffle splitter. 

Excess material is stored as crusher rejects. The 300 grams portion is pulverized to 90% 

passing 200 mesh in a ring and puck pulverizer, cleaned between samples with 

compressed air and with silica sand between the sample batches. The first sample of each 

batch is screened to ensure that 90% passes 200 mesh. 

In addition, 219 samples from Deposits 1 to 4 selected for metallurgical testing were re-

analysed by COREM and served as check samples analysed by a secondary laboratory. 

From these 219 samples, 144 Davis Tube concentrates and tails were analysed, in 

addition to the head analyses. 

Details on the 2008-2009 sampling are provided in the previously filed Technical Report 

by Met-Chem (2010). 

11.2.2 Monitoring of the Laboratories 

The blanks, standards and duplicates added by the geologists to the samples batches 

analysed by the ALS-Chemex laboratory as control samples represented 7.7% of the 

total.  



Century Iron Mines Corporation / Augyva Mining Resources Inc.  
43-101 Technical Report on the Mineral Resources of the Duncan Lake Iron Project  Page 33

  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

In addition, an equivalent of 9.7% (144 samples) of the total number of samples (1489) 

was sent to a second laboratory. These 144 samples were part of 219 samples sent to 

COREM for metallurgical test purposes, and were re-analysed to determine the head 

grade, in addition to the Davis Tube concentrate and tails. 

Visually barren quartz vein used for twenty-two blank samples representing 1.5% of the 

total returned values ranging from 0.24 to 0.97% Fe with an average Fe content of 0.42%. 

Met-Chem attributed the presence of the low-level iron as an addition at the sample 

preparation stage. 

From a total of forty-nine samples submitted as duplicate samples, only two pairs 

exceeded the acceptable threshold. In addition, no apparent bias was observed. 

A total of 144 samples rejects originally analysed by ALS-Chemex were submitted as 

duplicate samples to COREM laboratory prior to metallurgical testing. Both laboratories 

used the same analytical methods. The COREM's results indicated higher Total Fe % 

than ALS-Chemex. Met-Chem recommended investigating the source of the difference. 

Three certified standard materials of different iron grade acquired from Canmet, Toronto, 

Canada were used to monitor the accuracy of the assays from ALS-Chemex (Table 11.1).  

Table 11.1 – Certified Reference Material Used in 2008-09 

Standard ID Certified Value (Fe %) 

FER-2 27.43%  

FER-3 32.07%  

SCH-1 60.74% ± 0.09%. 

A total of 43 analyses, equivalent to 2.9% of all the samples, are available for these 

standards. Although the available data for each standard is limited, a good correlation and 

a relatively low variability between the certified and the assayed values were obtained. 

However, the percentage Fe grade of the standard was slightly higher than the assays by 

ALS-Chemex. The same trend was observed in the Corem's results.  

Still, the results were found to be acceptable to Met-Chem since most of the assays 

plotted within or close to the threshold of the "Mean ± 2 Standard Deviations". 

Consequently, Met-Chem did not consider the differences as critical to the resource 

estimate that was under way. 

Both ALS-Chemex and COREM are ISO certified and used similar QA-QC protocols 

and procedures, and processed these samples with the same preparation and analytical 

methods.  

11.2.3 Specific Gravity  

No specific gravity determinations were performed during the 2008-2009 drilling 

program. Historical information indicates a specific gravity of 3.48 g/cm

samples of mineralization on the north band of Deposit 1, for a grade estimated at 26% 

Fe total.  

Met-Chem used a specific gravity of 3.20 g/cm
3
 in the previous resource estimate, 

considering mining operations with similar grade of 25-27% Fe, are using a range of 3.1 

to 3.3 for the BIF. 

11.2.4  Security 

The chain of custody was preserved by Augyva and Century by retaining control from 

pick-up of the core at the drill site to splitting and shipping of the samples to the 

laboratory.  

11.2.5  Conclusions 

COREM is independent, is ISO certified and used similar QA protocols, sample 

preparation and analytical methods to those at ALS-Chemex. 

Met-Chem concluded that the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures 

were adequate and provided a degree of reliability sufficiently high to be used in the 

resources estimation. 

11.3 2011-2012 Drill Program 

11.3.1 Sampling, Analysis 

The IOS' geologists marked the sample intervals on the core and a line along which to 

split it. Core splitting was done by IOS at the core storage area in Radisson using 

hydraulic splitters at the beginning of the program, and subsequently a diamond blade 

saw. One half of the core was placed back in the boxes, along the original orientation and 

position, the other half was inserted into a plastic bag with a tag for identification. 

Nominal samples length was 3 m, with allowance to lengthen or shorten the sample 

intervals to 4.5 and 1.5 m when necessary to honour the main lithological contacts. 

The bags of split core were delivered in thick polypropylene bags by IOS personnel on 

site to the IOS facilities in Chicoutimi for sample preparation. Sample preparation, except 

for the six holes also drilled to provide material for metallurgical tests (DUN-11-237B, -

315, -324B, -352, -380 and -382), was contracted to the IOS Services Geoscientifiques 

Inc. ("IOS"), an independent sample preparation facility located in Chicoutimi.  

The samples were crushed by IOS to less than 10 mm in a jaw crusher, followed by a 

second pass in a roll mill, reducing the size to less than 2 mm. A sub-sample of 200 to 

300 g was extracted using a Jones riffle splitter and sent to ALS Chemex in Val-d'Or, 

Quebec, for analysis. 

The holes drilled for the needs of metallurgical testwork were sampled in a different way. 

The six holes of HQ core drilled into Deposits 3, 4 and 6 were transported from IOS to 

SGS-Lakefield for sample preparation and analysis. A portion of the core was removed 

for head analysis, since these holes served the dual purposes of geological investigation

and metallurgical testing. To that end, a thin sliver was cut off lengthwise along the core 

axis and cut in two, one half of which was submitted to analysis and the second half was 

saved as a reference sample. The rest of the core was used for the metallurgical testwork. 

A report dated January 25, 2012 and entitled "Selection of Samples for Metallurgical 

Testwork" was issued by Met-Chem to document the procedures and the actual sampling 

activities. 

All the samples were submitted to XRF-Lithium Borate fusion for analysis of the major 

oxides, including total iron. Selected samples had determination of sulphur by Leco 

Furnace, Loss on Ignition (LOI %), ferrous iron titration, multi-element ICP-OES 

Analysis and Davis Tube tests. 

A batch of 100 samples from Deposits 3, 4 and 6 were later analysed for sulphur, and 

used to investigate the acid-generating potential of the mineralization.  

11.3.2 Davis Tube Tests 

A total of 843 samples were submitted to Davis Tube tests of which 414 samples were 

tested at SGS Lakefield, Canada, 285 at IOS, in addition to the 144 tests performed at 

Corem in 2009.  

A total of 285 Davis Tube Tests were completed by IOS. The operating parameters are 

listed in Table 11.2.

A suite of additional 414 samples were sent to SGS Lakefield in order to have some of 

the tests done by an accredited laboratory. These samples had previously been sent to 

Actlabs but they were all rejected over some issues and doubts on the results that showed 

a systematic bias in the Davis Tube test results.

11.4 Laboratory Monitoring (2011-2012 Drilling) 

11.4.1  QA-QC Protocol 

The QA-QC protocol for the drill program of 2011-2012 was designed and applied by 

IOS, a consulting firm who had been mandated by Century to implement and supervise 

all the field activities. Met-Chem's role in the drill program consisted of acting as the QP 

for the resources estimate and, consequently, was limited to follow the progress of the 

field activities, examine and perform preliminary interpretation of the results as the work 

progressed, carry the QP site visit and perform spot checks on the analytical results and 

the assay database.   

Karen Gagné, IOS'chemist, was responsible for monitoring the analytical results from the 

laboratory. The results were checked as they became available by maintaining control 

graphs and statistics up to date. Re-analysis of a lot was requested if the differences 

between the certified value and the analytical results of the standards exceeded the mean 

and two standard deviations threshold. 

IOS inserted duplicate samples, as well as blank and certified standard materials into the 

sample stream to monitor the laboratory performance. 

Since shipping of the samples to ALS-Minerals was done by individual batches for each 

hole separately, IOS included the following suite of QC samples as the first samples, 

before routine insertion of QC samples: Blank-Standard-Standard-Blank. Afterward, the 

following QC samples were systematically added to the core sample sequence: 

• Blanks: 3% 

• Standards: 4% 

• Duplicate samples: 3% 

The actual number of control samples with valid analyses is listed in Table 11.3. 

Table 11.3 – QC Samples in the 2011-2012 Program, with Valid Analytical Results 

Material Number Percentage 

Blank 443 5.76% 

Duplicates 307 3.99% 

Standards 399 5.19% 

Total 1,149 14.94% 

Analyses 7,689   

11.4.2  Quality Control Samples 

a) Blanks 

Samples identified as Blank QC samples total 518 in the database. However, some 

missing analyses and ten Blanks that returned high values (14.57 to 62.85% Fe2O3) 



Century Iron Mines Corporation / Augyva Mining Resources Inc.

reduced the total to 443 valid results. The majority of the Fe% results (mode) for 

the blanks are around 0.25% Fe (Table 11.4 and Figure 11.1).  

Table 11.4 – Fe% Content of the Blanks – Basic Statistics 

Blank Samples Parameter Fe% 

Average 0.28 

Minimum 0.12 

Maximum 0.94 

Number of samples 443 

Figure 11.1 – Histogram Displaying the Fe% Content of the Blanks 

The blank material used in the 2008-09 program was non-certified quartz material 

and suffered from the same problem, albeit with slightly higher values (0.24 to 

0.97% Fe range, 0.42% average). Met-Chem attributed the presence of iron as an 

addition at the sample preparation stage. 

Halite was used as Blank material at the beginning of the project and was analysed 

34 times. Iron values were all below detection limits, but the lack of abrasiveness of 

the salt would probably not be expected to pick up any remnant iron dust from the 

previous samples or to generate contamination by wear on the pulverizer. 

Two samples of barren rocks, commonly greywacke, felsic or mafic volcanic rocks, 

were systematically collected to bracket the BIF intervals. These samples are not 

devoid of iron but may still allow to detect sample mix-up with BIF samples, if not 

the sample to sample contamination at the preparation stage.

b) Certified Reference Material  

Eleven standard reference materials were used by IOS to monitor the laboratory 

accuracy. Four of them were commercial certified standards (Table 11.5), the other 

ones being internal or not fully documented standards. Some were so rarely inserted 

into the sample stream as to provide little information. 

Table 11.5 – Standard Reference Materials

c) Duplicate Samples 

Quarter splits of the split or sawed core were used as QC duplicate samples. The 

duplicates were inserted at a rate of about 4% and submitted to the laboratory under 

a different number. The number attributed to the duplicate sample corresponded to 

a number that would be several samples down the sequence from the original. 

11.4.3  Davis Tube Testing 

A total of 285 Davis Tube Tests were completed by IOS. The operating parameters are 

listed in Table 11.2. 

Quality Control of the Davis Tube Tests results was achieved by IOS by applying the 

following procedures: 

• Visual grain size control at roll mills 

• Grain size control at rod mills (Laser dispersion method) 

• Micro-XRF analysis of concentrate (test rejected if <66% Fe) 

• Susceptibility meter measurement on tailings (test rejected if > 2% Mgt) 

• Mass balance (test rejected if more than 1 gram loss). 

A suite of additional 414 samples were sent to SGS Lakefield in order to have some of 

the tests done by an accredited laboratory. These samples had previously been sent to 

Actlabs but they were all rejected over some issues and doubts on the results.

11.4.4  Specific Gravity 

The specific gravity was determined by IOS on a total of 4,967 barren and mineralized 

samples selected from 93 different holes, in addition to 93 duplicate determinations 

(Table 11.6). The water displacement method was used as a primary method and all the 

samples were also processed by the pycnometer technique. The average weight of the 

samples was 7.05 kg and ranged from 1.3 to 15.6 kg. 

The samples used to calculate the average density of the mineralization are those within 

the envelopes of the 3D model prepared for the present resources estimate.

Total 3,107 3.179 2.41 to 3.94 1,860 2.913 2.61 to 3.78 

The quality control applied by IOS consisted of: 

• Monitoring the water temperature to keep it at 23-26°C; 

• Perform a determination on all the samples using the pycnometer technique;  

• Duplicate determinations (4.2% of the samples). 

The maximum differences between the pycnometer measurements and the displacement 

methods were 0.04 to -0.04. The results from the duplicate tests were very close to those 

of the original determination, 70 of them being within differences of 0.02 and -0.02, 

(Table 11.7).

11.5 Security 

The samples were shipped from the field by IOS geologists to the IOS facilities in 

Chicoutimi for sample preparation or processing, and on to the laboratory, which 

preserved the chain of custody. IOS had some control over most of the way the samples

were travelling to and there are no reasons to believe that the integrity of the samples was 

compromised or that the samples were tampered with. 

11.6 Conclusions, Recommendations 

The percentage of control samples (close to 15%) to monitor the laboratory used by IOS 

is significantly higher than that in most projects targeting iron formation.  

Quarter splits of the split or sawed core were used as QC duplicate samples. In general, 

Met-Chem believes preparation of a sub-sample at the crushing stage (coarse rejects) 

provides a more representative duplicate sample than quartering the unevenly broken 

pieces of the split core, especially if the core was split rather than sawn. 

A few of the in-house standards used by IOS are not well documented or showed higher 

variability than the commercial standard-used. Some of the standards were not used often 

enough to provide statistically valid information. A relatively large number of mis-

identification of the standards was found in the database although, to a large degree, the 

errors found in the QA-QC data were corrected. The use of standard TLS-1 which is a 

sulphide concentrate from Sudbury is problematic when analysed by fusion discs by 

XRF. All but three of the analyses for this standard fell outside of the upper limit of the 

certified value and the other ones show a strong high bias. 

The use of non-certified blank material leaves the question of possible iron contamination 

at the preparation stage unresolved.  

Until March 2012, IOS conducted the validation of the analytical data and did request re-

analysis of several batches of samples that failed the acceptability threshold.  

In conclusion, Met-Chem believes the QA/QC control system, represented by a large 

number of control samples and several passes of validation, has not detected any 

significant bias or error during analysis that has not been corrected. Met-Chem believes 

that the laboratory performance was adequately monitored and that the analytical results 

of the core samples are sufficiently reliable to serve in a resources estimate.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION AND CORROBORATION 

12.1 Previous Verifications 

12.1.1 Geologica 

Prior to Met-Chem's visit, Geologica Groupe Conseil had visited Deposit 1 of the DLIP 

in 2008, and produced the first NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Duncan Lake 

Property. Eight grab samples were collected and analysed for iron by Atomic Absorption 

and for gold by Fire Assay. Iron analyses ranged from 25.47 to 33.18% Fe. 

12.2 Verification by Met-Chem 

12.2.1 Previous Site Visit (2009) 

A previous site visit from a QP was made from September 14 to 16, 2009 by Mr. Raynald 

Jean, Geo., as Senior Geologist of Met-Chem at the time. The visit occurred after a major 

drilling program had been completed, and was carried out in preparation for a resource 

estimate documented in a Technical Report entitled "Report on the Duncan Lake 

Property 2008-2009 Diamond Drilling", dated December 2010. 

Mr. Raynald Jean found evidence in the field of four drill sites out of the five holes 

drilled in 1973 in Deposit 6, but only one collar (73-01 casing) was positively identified 

and surveyed. The 1973 holes were included in the database and the data used for the 

resource estimate. 

A total of sixteen recent drill sites over Deposits 1 to 5 were visited and the GPS readings 

by Met-Chem were very close to the coordinates entered into the database. 

During the site visit, the drill core of five holes was examined. The description and the 

contacts of the lithological units and of the sample intervals were found to have been 

correctly recorded. 

Five independent check samples of quartered core, or of pieces of core picked at regular 

intervals, were collected. Differences of up to 4.36% Fe were observed between the 

original and duplicate samples, which were attributed to the lack of representativity that 

is provided by core quartered from originally split core. 

Two holes were drilled in 2009 to validate previous drilling information (DUN09-43 near 

73-01 and DUN09-44 near 73-09) but the results were inconclusive. The distances 

between the pairs of holes are estimated at 36 and 43 m which are too high to be used for 

validation of grades. 

The core from the 1973 diamond drill campaign has never been found. The core from the 

drilling campaign of 2008-2009 was stored in racks with a roof at a facility located close 

to Radisson. 

The laboratories used for the sample preparation and analysis were not visited. Both 

ALS-Chemex and COREM laboratories are independent, are ISO certified and apply 

strict internal QA-QC protocols.

The main concern raised by R. Jean about the DLIP was related to the lack of uniformity 

in the lithological descriptions by the different geologists involved in the core logging. 

Core description and the rock type assigned were not fully uniform among the geologists.  

Met-Chem was of the opinion that the assay results were representative of the Deposits. 

Several phases of validation of the database were completed by Met-Chem. Met-Chem 

concluded that the data was satisfactorily reliable to be used in the resources estimate. 

12.2.2 Site visit by Met-Chem (2011) 

a) Introduction 

Met-Chem's geologists, Yves. A. Buro, Eng. and M.-A. Brulotte, Geo., were on 

site on August 9 to 12, 2011 in order to complete a personal inspection of the DLIP 

property for a QP visit, as required by the NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for 

Mineral Projects. The visit also served to insure that the drill density and pattern 

were adequate for Met-Chem to estimate resources, and that the best practices 

guidelines were followed. 

A Field Visit Report dated August 15, 2011 was prepared to document the 

observations and recommendations resulting from the visit by Met-Chem. The main 

points of this report are summarized in this section. 

b) Activities 

The exploration and drilling aspects of the Project were reviewed with IOS field 

geologists and Allan Wenlong Gan, Geo., Century's Chief Geologist. 

A trip was taken to the field to examine outcrops and check the position of old and 

active drill sites in Blocks 3 and 6. Nine hole collars were checked with a hand-held 

GPS and were well within the accuracy of the instrument when compared against 

their coordinates entered into the database. 

Part of the core drilled in 2008-09 was spilled or mixed-up when the core racks 

shifted on instable ground. Later on, the core had to be hastily removed from the 

shed, placed on pallets. The 2011-2012 core was placed outside, in an open yard, in 

covered core racks. 

The core from selected holes was reviewed with the IOS' geologists and compared 

against the drill logs in Geotic format, as well as the temporary database on site.  

The main recommendations brought up by the site visit follow. 

c) Main Recommendations 

• Distinguish fracture zones from faults and provide qualitative estimate of 

impact (major, minor fault) based on presence of gouge, fault breccia; 

• Distinguish types of felsic intrusive rocks that may be related with different 

ages of injection (pre-, post-mineralization);

• Quit the procedure of adjusting the sample intervals to have round depth 

numbers, which is totally unacceptable as it dilutes the samples of iron 

formation at the contacts with waste or reduces the length of the iron 

formation by the amount left in the waste samples bracketing the 

mineralization; use the flexibility of varying the systematic 3.0-m sample 

length between 1.5 and 4.5 m to cut the samples at the exact contacts of the 

lithological units. This practice was stopped after the QP visit and corrective 

action was later taken by re-sampling; 

• Have the contacts of the lithological units and of the samples reviewed by a 

peer before splitting/sawing the core. 

12.2.3 Independent Check Sampling 

a) Head Analyses 

Met-Chem selected 50 samples covering a fair range of iron contents and depths in 

Deposits 3, 4 and 6 to be re-analysed and to serve as independent check samples. 

The rejects were used rather than re-splitting half core, which Met-Chem does not 

consider as a very good duplicate sample, especially if the half core has been split 

rather than sawn. 

The analytical results for Total Fe and SiO2 in Met-Chem's independent check 

samples are provided in Table 12.1 with the results for the other oxides, sulphur 

and Loss on Ignition provided under Appendix B.

The check samples were shipped without the five QC samples (2 Duplicate samples, 2 

Standards and 1 Blank) that were requested by Met-Chem. In addition, several requested 

samples could not be located or had insufficient material to perform the complete set of 

analyses. 

It is fortunate that the duplicate analyses did not show any bias, which made the absence 

of Standards analysed with this batch of samples less crucial. The duplicate samples show 

high correlation and low variability relative to the original samples. The basic statistical 

parameters for head total iron and silica and the ranges of differences between the 

original and duplicate analyses for the individual pairs are listed in Table 12.2 and 

illustrated in Figure 12.1.

12.2.4  Database Validation by Met-Chem 

Most data were transmitted by IOS to Met-Chem in Geotic format and part of the results 

was in Excel spreadsheets. IOS checked the data before sending them and Met-Chem did 

additional verifications of the master database using formulas in Excel sheets, the 

software GeoticLog and MineSight. 

Most errors were corrected with the help of IOS, R. Gauthier of Roche and Zhihuan Wan, 

the Century's geologist who took over responsibility for the project after IOS's contract 

was ended. 

The main problem Met-Chem found with the database was in the use of combinations of 

several rock codes for the main lithological units, which cannot be handled or plotted on 

sections by mining software. Lack of uniformity in the codes attributed to some of the 

rocks by the logging geologists was observed. 

The un-sampled portions of barren rocks left between the sampled intervals were filled in 

if they represented 15 m in core length or less. This was done to facilitate interpretation 

and 3D modeling. Likewise, the samples that had mixed BIF and barren material at the 

time the geologists were using round depth numbers for the contacts of the samples were 

re-sampled.  

However, Met-Chem believes that most of the errors were fixed and the uncertain data 

were left out and do not represent a significant percentage of the total. A comprehensive 

QA-QC system applied to the laboratory monitoring and to the sample preparation and 

Davis Tube tests carried out by IOS add to the reliability of the data.  Consequently, Met-

Chem believes the data are of sufficiently high quality to be used for a resource estimate 

and a preliminary economic assessment of the DLIP. Additional development work will 

be required to upgrade the knowledge of the project to advance the DLIP to a Pre-

Feasibility stage. 

12.2.5  Verifications of the QA-QC Implemented by IOS 

a) General 

Met-Chem examined the QA-QC system applied by IOS and completed spot 

checks of the results obtained by the control samples inserted by IOS into the 

sample stream. Some of the checks were done shortly before all the sample results 

had been received. All the QC samples were added to the sample stream at the IOS 

facilities in Chicoutimi.

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

The analytical results entered by IOS into the master database were validated by 

IOS but Met-Chem did some additional verifications. 

b) Blank Samples  

The majority of the Blank samples contain 0.25% Fe and range from 0.12% to 

0.94% Fe, as discussed under Chapter 11.4 of this report. 

Met-Chem attempted to determine whether the low levels of iron present in all the 

blank samples correspond to background values of the barren quartz or is 

introduced at the sample preparation stage. Analysis of a suite of blank material 

used by IOS after pulverisation in Tungsten Carbide pots, in order to ensure no iron 

contamination is introduced, was requested by Met-Chem. Ten samples were 

prepared by ALS Chemex in Val-d'Or and  shipped to SGS Lakefield for analysis. 

The results from these samples strongly support the view that the blank material 

does contain some iron (Table 12.6).

Carbide Pot

82818027 0.11 0.32 

82818078 0.02 0.22 

The fact that the level of Fe content in the blanks analysed with the core samples of 

2011-2012 seems to be slightly but systematically higher than the level suggested 

by the ten samples that have been processed with special grinding apparatus points 

to the possibility of introduction of some Fe into the sample at the pulverization 

stage. The fact that up to 0.2% Fe can be added to the sample by the pulverization 

process has been documented on samples from other iron projects.  

Met-Chem believes the blank samples used by IOS contain a low background level 

of iron and that some iron is added at the sample preparation stage.

c) Standard Reference Materials 

IOS used up to 11 standard reference materials, either commercial certified 

reference material or internal standards. Met-Chem found a significant number of 

mis-labeled standards, although the label on most of them could be arbitrarily re-

assigned by their Fe content (Table 12.7).

Figure 12.3 – Plot of the Fe Percent in Standard Fe-3 

The commercial standard TLS-1 is a sulphide concentrate, which is a poor choice for an 

iron standard because its high sulphur content is problematic in XRF analysis on fusion 

discs. The analytical results for these standards are precise but lack accuracy (Figure 

12.4).  

Figure 12.4 – Plot of the Fe Percent in Standard TSL-1 

The internal Reference Material PFEMRI11 and MRIMIL06 prepared by IOS show the 

highest variability of all the standards. The latter is heavy minerals concentrate with 

added pyrochlore to monitor niobium-tantalum.

The standards for which less than 25 or 30 analyses are available have restricted 

usefulness. 

Clearly, the identification of the standards by the geologists could have been more 

diligent. However, Met-Chem believes the large number of valid analytical data provided 

by the standards has adequately monitored the laboratory performance. The analytical 

results for the standards examined by Met-Chem show that they generally stayed within 

the acceptable limits of the mean and two standard deviations. 

12.2.6 Secondary Laboratory 

A total of 394 samples from Deposits 3, 4 and 6 originally analysed by Activation 

Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs), Ancaster, Ontario, were re-analysed by SGS. A high 

correlation between the two sets of data is apparent, except for one sample. The 

correlation coefficient is 0.996 and the absolute difference in the individual pairs over the 

average was 1.01% for the median with a maximum of 8.59% (except for one value at 

30.3%), which is excellent. 

Figure 12.5 – Comparison of Total Fe % by SGS and Actlabs 

These samples were also submitted to Davis Tube testing, but they were completely 

ignored since some issues as to the reliability of the results were raised, and remain 

unresolved. 

12.2.7 Density Determinations by IOS 

Met-Chem did not request a series of samples for independent density determinations, 

since a fairly large number of samples had been processed by IOS using two methods on 

each sample and validating the results by duplicate determinations on close to 2% of the 

samples.

  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

A few errors were found in the IOS database of the samples used for the density 

determinations, and the affected samples were eliminated. Met-Chem estimates that these 

errors were in such low percentage as to have no impact on the validity of the results. A 

density factor of 3.2 g/cm
3
 used in the previous resources estimates was retained in the 

present calculations to convert volumes into tonnes. 

Met-Chem believes the density determinations were carried out by IOS with extreme care 

and serious validation and are reliable. Consequently, Met-Chem has used these results, 

which confirmed the original parameter used to convert volumes into tonnes, in the 

present resource estimation.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Drill Holes for the Needs of Metallurgical Testwork 

Two holes were drilled in each of the Blocks 3, 4 and 6 deposits to provide material for 

metallurgical testwork and the core of the complete holes was transported to the IOS 

facilities in Chicoutimi (Table 13.1). Rénald Gauthier, P. Geol., D.E.S.S., Roche Ltd 

Consulting Group, and Yves A. Buro, Eng., Met-Chem, selected and marked the core 

intervals to supply to the metallurgical laboratory during the days of January 5 to 7, 2012 

in Chicoutimi. Subsequently, the core samples were shipped to SGS Lakefield, Ontario to 

have a sliver cut for the head analyses and the rest of the material used in the testwork. 

These holes were drilled in HQ-sized core in order to generate sufficient material for 

metallurgical testing and head assays.

used for each tests is shown in Table 13.2. For each block, some samples were either not 

available or cancelled because selective mining will segregate these specific lithology for 

a particular block as shown in the legend. A total of seven lithologies from Blocks 3, 4 

and 6 were submitted.

The following test work are under way on previous listed samples and composites : 

• Whole-rock analysis and full ICP-scan 

• The JK drop-weight 

• Bond Low-energy impact 

• Bond abrasion tests 

• Sag Mill Comminution test 

• Bond rod mill and Bond ball mill grindability tests 

• Coarse cobbing. 

Davis tube testing and sulfur analysis is currently under review. 

More than 400 samples were pulverized to have 95% passing -325 mesh (44 microns) for 

the Davis tube testing. The weight recovery of the magnetic concentrate is near a quarter 

from the feed to the Davis tube for a silica content of approximately 5% in the 

concentrate.  

There is indication that most of the sulfur from the feed is recovered in the non-magnetic 

tailings which might need to be treated accordantly if they are acid-generating. 

Detailed results will be provided with the Preliminary Economical Assessment. 

Eight samples collected selected to represent various observed mineralization zones were 

used by SGS for a QEMSCAN study. Relatively high levels of both pyrite and pyrrhotite 

were reported. Pyrite content dominated in five samples, with small amounts of pyrrhotite 

that tendered to occur as inclusions in magnetite.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

14.1 Mineral Resource Estimate Statement 

Following a drilling campaign from 2011 to 2012 Met-Chem was mandated by Century 

to update the resource estimate of the Duncan Lake project. To remind the first resource 

estimate compliant with the NI 43-101 standard on the project was done by Met-Chem in 

2010. That estimate took into account historical drill holes drilled in 1973 and drill holes 

drilled in the 2008-2009 drilling campaign. Comparatively to the 2010 estimate 125 

newer holes were added in the database for the purpose of the present estimate. 

Furthermore, historical holes drilled in 1973 were not taken into account due to different 

issues which will be discussed in the section related to drill hole database.  

The Duncan Lake project is composed of 6 deposits named from 1 to 6. A total of 177 

holes were used to interpolate the different deposits in the present estimate. The 

estimation was performed using 3D software MineSight™ and the block modeling 

approach was used. All work was performed under the supervision of the qualified 

persons. The resource classification follows the guidelines adopted by the Council of the 

Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") through the NI 43-101 

standards and guidelines. The criteria used by Met-Chem classifying the estimated 

resources are based on certainty and continuity of geology and grades.  

The relevant definitions of the CIM standards for resource classification are provided in 

section 14.2. A summary of the Mineral Resource for all deposits is provided in Table 

14.1.

14.2 Definitions 

According the final version of the CIM Standards/NI 43-101 which becomes effective on 

February 1, 2001 and was revised on June 30, 2011: 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural, solid, 

inorganic or fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and 

industrial minerals in or on the Earth crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade 

or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, 

grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, 

estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.

An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 

grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 

sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The 

estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered trough appropriate 

techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 

grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a 

level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 

economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability 

of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing 

information gathered through appropriate techniques from location such as outcrops, 

trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and 

grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 

grade or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they 

can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of 

technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the 

economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable

• Check and validation of the drill hole Database received from IOS; 

• Importation of the Database in MineSight v7.0-5 for each deposit; 

• Generation of cross sections that were used for geological interpretation; 

• Basic statistics analyse to assess the behaviour of the different elements, need of 

grade capping and compositing length; 

• Development of 3-D envelope for each deposit which shows sufficient continuity of 

geology and mineralisation; 

• Geostatistical analysis of variables constrained within the mineralized envelop to 

assess the spatial continuity of the mineralization and determine search ellipse 

parameters; 

• Generation of block models for each deposit for interpolation purpose; 

• Grade interpolation and resource classification according to CIM/NI 43-101 

definitions; 

• Mineral Resource statement. 

14.4 Drill Hole Database and Data Verification 

The drill hole database used in this estimate was furnished by IOS Services 

Géoscientifiques Inc. ("IOS") which was in charge of managing the 2011-2012 drilling 

campaign.  

The software used by IOS for data entry and handling is GeoticLog™. IOS used internal 

procedures to verify accuracy and soundness of data entered within the database. For this 

purpose a chemist was exclusively mandated to check and validate all assays results 

before their entry in the database. A GeoticLog version of the database was transmitted to 

Met-Chem where M.-K. Lachapelle, P. Geo., was responsible in rechecking and 

validating all entries.  

Three steps were used in Met-Chem validation procedure. In the first step validation 

modules implemented in GeoticLog™ were used. Thereafter data were exported into 

Excel for further verifications before importing into MineSight™. Met-Chem has check 

in Excel for gaps, overlaps and repeating samples and has no found major error.  

Finally further checking was completed by validation process implemented in 

MineSight™ when importing the data. Visual checks of assays results on cross sections 

were also performed in MineSight™. Prior importing the data into MineSight Met-Chem 

has replaced all assays fields with missing values with -1, which is MineSight code for 

missing data. Values under assays detection limit were replaced by half of the same 

detection limit. 

The entire database contains one hundred ninety nine (199) drill holes that were drilled 

between 1973 and 2012. Twenty-two (22) holes were drilled in 1973, fifty two (52) holes 

during the 2008-2009 drilling campaign and one hundred twenty-four (125) holes during 

the last drilling campaign of 2011-2012. The 2010 estimate has used both historical holes

drilled in 1973 and holes of the 2008-2009 drilling campaign. For the purpose of the 

present estimate only data of the drilling campaigns of 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 were 

used. It was decided to ignore historical data since some issues related to their confidence 

level were highlighted.  

The Main issues questioned were related to their exact location, the absence of QA/QC 

procedure in that moment and the missing cores to allow rechecking.  

Furthermore, exact analytical procedure description was missing and it was assumed that 

soluble iron method has been used. That method differs considerably of the XRF method 

which was used to analyse all samples of the 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 drilling 

campaigns.  

The content of the drill hole database imported into MineSight™ is presented in Table 

14.2 while the statistics of that part of the data used for the present estimation are 

presented in Table 14.3.

14.4.1 Geological Modeling Procedures 

After importing the drill hole database into MineSight vertical sections were generated in 

order to perform geological interpretation on 2D basis prior generation of 3D envelopes 

by triangulation. The drilling grid spacing varied mainly from 200 m to 400 m, with a 

very little number of sections drilled at 100 m, according the considered deposit. Deposits 

1, 3, 4, and 6 are those being more drilled with a 200 m spacing while deposits 2 and 5

have been drilled according more spaced grid. Vertical sections were defined 

perpendicular to deposits elongation and looking east-northeast.  

A Digital Terrain Modeling (DTM) was created using public data source 

(www.geobase.ca, Federal government website). For that purpose contour lines with an 

interval of 2 m were used. However, that precision does not reflect the precision level of 

data acquisition. For holes drilled during the 2008-2009 drilling campaign collar 

elevation was linked on the DTM map created since elevation furnished by hand GPS had 

a margin of error equal 3 times the magnitude of error on X and Y direction. Holes drilled 

during 2011-2012 drilling campaign were surveyed with Differential GPS (DGPS) which 

gives coordinates with high precision level. For this reason their Z values were kept 

same.  

The recently completed Lidar survey was not used since the data was being processed at 

the time of writing the present report. 

A cut-off grade of 16% Fe was used when modeling ore limits on vertical sections. That 

cut-off was considered as a realistic number based on values being used in operating 

mines in Canada. The recommended cut-off value may change anytime depending iron 

price on the market. It should be noted that the cut-off value used to draw the iron ore 

boundaries on sections is not based on any economic study related to the Duncan Lake 

Iron Project. In the 2010 resource estimate a minimum thickness of 6 m was used to 

determine if an interpreted mineralized lens should be considered individually for mining 

purpose or diluted within neighboring lenses. In the present estimate that limit was fixed 

at 10 m taking into account size of mining equipment being now used.  

However, changes introduced affect only deposits 3, 4 and 6 where newer holes were 

drilled in 2011-2012. No change was made in the geological interpretation of deposits 1, 

2 and 5. In addition to information displayed on vertical sections Met-hem has also used 

the surface geological map produced by the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources and 

Fauna (MNRF) and available magnetic map to support geological interpretation. 

Geological contacts were snapped on individual section based on real (X, Y, Z) 

coordinates. 2D polygons defined on section basis were then used to produce 3D 

envelopes by triangulation of the contact points. 3D envelopes were thereafter used to 

assign a specific envelope code to all assays within each block model. 

14.5 Basic Statistical Analysis on Assays 

Using updated database Met-Chem performed basic statistics on assays data in order to 

better understand grades distribution and take necessary actions before going to next 

steps of resource estimate.  

In Table 14.4, statistics were calculated for different elements in head and Davis Tube 

products. Samples used to calculate statistics referred to all deposits and were constrained 

within mineralized envelopes according geological interpretation.

Table 14.4 – Basic statistics on assays constrained within mineralized envelopes 

Figure 14.1 to Figure 14.5 show histograms for major head elements and Davis Tube 

products. The total head iron histogram (Fe %) shows two populations.  

A dominant population is this related to banded iron formation with a peak of frequency 

at about 27% Fe. Another population, less pronounced, is present between 1 and 15% Fe 

and is mainly related to presence of internal waste such as felsic intrusions. Such waste 

population (Fe < 15%) represents about 17.5% of all assays within mineralized envelopes 

in all deposits.  

The silica oxide in head shows a pattern close to a Gaussian distribution since the mode, 

average and median are very close. Assays results for product elements, Davis Tube 

Weight Recovery, Iron and Silica in the concentrate, were only available for 805 samples. 

This means that not all head samples were systematically been submitted to Davis Tube 

analyses.  

Samples submitted to such analyses were not chosen to cover entire holes but are rather 

randomly scattered in different holes.  

Related DWTR%, FeDT% and SiO2DT% histograms are presented in Figure 14.3 to 

Figure 14.5. Figure 14.6 shows histogram of sampling length. Sampling length is varying 

between 30 cm and 9.38 m with an average of 3.09 m and a mode of 3 m.

14.6 Regression Function for Missing DTWR% 

Using pairs of samples for which Fe % and Davis Tube Weight Recovery (DTWR %) 

were analysed a regression function was built in order to estimate the correlation level 

between both variables (Figure 14.7). The correlation coefficient founded is relatively 

high (R2 = 0.82) and demonstrates a pretty strong relationship between those variables. 



Century Iron Mines Corporation / Augyva Mining Resources Inc.

  October 2012 
  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

For this reason the regression model build was use to fill with calculated values of 

DTWR% all samples where this element was not analysed. The number of samples 

submitted to Davis Tube tests are 843. In fact 841 pairs of samples were used to build the 

regression function. This function was used to fill 8,336 samples (exclusion made of 2 

outliers) with calculated DTWR %. Among those 8,324 samples calculated 5,107 

samples were constrained within the mineralized envelopes and were involved in 

resource modeling. The percentage of samples used to build the regression model versus 

number of DTWR % being calculated is 16.47%. This percentage should be increased to 

50% in next stages of the project development by analysing more DTWR %. Furthermore 

Met-Chem recommends to perform Satmagan determinations of magnetic iron on 

samples already analysed for DTWR% in order to analyse the correlation relationship 

between both assessing methodologies. Since the Satmagan Test is cheaper than the 

Davis Tube Test it is recommended to later switch to this method when analysing the 

magnetic iron content of samples. 

By this way, remaining samples not analysed with the Davis Tube method could be 

submitted to the Satmagan iron determination once the correlation relationship between 

both methods is well established. 

Figure 14.7 – Regression model between DTWR% and Head Fe% 

14.7 High Values Capping 

For Fe% only one value corresponding to a grade of 47.75% iron could be considered as 

outlier since it value differ of about 9.5% of the rest of high values population. Because 

this difference was found to be not much pronounced not cut-off was apply. In the 

population of head SiO2% there are 4 extreme values ranging from 77.76% to 86.38% 



Century Iron Mines Corporation / Augyva Mining Resources Inc.

  October 2012 
  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

while remaining high grades population ranges from 68% to 74.18% SiO2. It was found 

that 3 of those extreme values are related to shorter samples. These values were kept as 

they will be diluted during compositing. There was any outlier associated with FeDT%. 

We have also decided to not remove the only SiO2DT% outlier (36% SiO2) which is 

combined with the lowest FeDT%. In conclusion not capping was applied to any element 

for the purpose of the present resource modeling. 

14.8 Compositing 

Compositing was done at the fixed length of 3 m, which represents the statistical mode of 

sampling length population. Normal down the hole compositing approach at a fixed 

length of 3 m was used. Composite histograms of relevant elements are show on Figure 

14.8 to Figure 14.12. A particular attention was made on DTWR% histogram since a 

regression model was used to calculate most of values. A peak of samples having 

DTWR% equal or close to zero could be seen on the histogram left corner. These 

correspond mainly to calculated DTWR% values. In fact, with the regression equation 

negative DTWR% values were calculated for all samples having Fe% less than 9.50%. 

Those negative values were replaced by zero. Corresponding under population 

(Fe < 9.50%) is easily visible on the left part of FE% composites histogram.

14.9 Variograms Modeling 

Variograms were modeled using 3 m composites population in order to analyse the 

spatial continuity of the mineralization and determine parameters to be used for blocks 

interpolation. Variograms were modeled by S. Ibrango, Ph.D., P. Geo., Senior geologist 

at Met-Chem. In the 2010 estimate variograms were only build for deposit 1 which was 

the only no deformed deposit having sufficient data. In the present case variograms were

generated for deposit 4 since the recent drilling program has allowed increasing number 

of available data. No newer drill holes were drilled on block 1 and this explain why 

variograms were not regenerated for this deposit. Figure 14.13 and Figure 14.14 show the 

histogram of elements used in modeling variograms. The number of samples used is 1606 

which represent a statistically relevant population size for such analysis.

Directional variograms were generated for Fe% and DTWR% in directions corresponding 

to the major axis (axe of better continuity), the semi major axis (perpendicular to the 

major) and the minor axis (normally perpendicular to the major and semi-major axis).  

Figure 14.15 and Figure 14.16 show experimental and model variograms on strike 

direction (Major Axis) with an azimuth of N60° and a dip of 0°. Range founded in this 

axis is 300 m for both Fe% and DTWR%. A high nugget effect is present for DTWR% 

where the ratio nugget to total sill is 85.76% comparatively to 32.14% in the case of Fe%.

Figure 14.16 – DTWR% Variograms along Strike Direction (Major Axis) for Deposit 4 

In the semi major axis (Dip direction) ranges of 150 m and 254 m were respectively 

founded for Fe% and DTWR% (Figure 14.17 and Figure 14.18). However, the 

corresponding sills were higher than the variance of pair elements. This is not the ideal 

situation. Furthermore, there were lesser pairs of samples available for that direction. 

This reflects the fact that the dip direction was lesser drilled than the strike direction.  

During variograms modeling of deposit 1 in previous resource estimate it was not 

possible to model the dip direction due to lack of information in that direction. A chosen 

value was used by the QP based on his experience on such BIF deposits. For now ranges 

founded in the dip direction could be considered as the best information available and 

based on variogram modeling. Variograms analysis of the dip direction should be redone 

ounce that direction is better informed. For the purpose of the present estimate Met-Chem 

has elected to consider the more conservative lower range (150 m) for the semi major 

axis.

Combined down-hole variograms were generated in order to provide an indication of the 

range of down-hole continuity as well as the background of nugget effect for samples 

taken at the same point or very close. Figure 14.19 and Figure 14.20 display experimental 

and model down-hole variograms for Fe% and DTWR%. For both elements the nugget 

effect are respectively 39.49% and 35.88% of the total sill. The range on the down-hole 

direction is approximately 12 m and variograms show a Hole-Effect pattern. Since drill 

holes are implemented to intersect the iron formation perpendicular to the strike and dip 

direction, the range of the down-hole variogram could reasonably be considered as an 

approximation of the spatial continuity in the minor axis. In fact minor axis, strictly 

considered, is generally not well define in the case of dipping mineralization (in 

opposition to horizontal layers) due to lack of enough information in this direction. 

Figure 14.19 – Fe% Combined Downhole Variograms (considered as the Minor Axis) for 

Deposit 4 

In the 2010 estimate a range of 30 m was found on deposit 1 when modeling down-hole 

variogram. For the purpose of the present estimate we have elected to consider the 

averaged down-hole range as range in the minor axis. For this reason a distance of 20 m 

was considered as reasonable for this direction.

In conclusion, ellipse parameters considered for resource interpolation are following; 

300 m on the major axis, 150 m on the semi major axis and 20 m on the minor axis. This 

basis ellipse is oriented according each deposit considered and when necessary according 

under domains defined in some deposits. Domain orientations are discussed in the block 

modeling section. 

14.10 Density 

A density of 3.2 g/cc was used to convert the volumes into tonnes, based on a study 

completed by IOS. The density was determined on a total of 3,107 mineralized samples 

selected from 93 different holes. The water displacement method was used and the 

average of the density measurements was 3.179.  

Consequently, Met-Chem used a rounded up factor of 3.2, which is the same Met-Chem 

used in the previous resources estimates (2010), and is in line with the factor used by 

similar iron deposits and mines. The technique used by IOS for the density determination 

is discussed under section 11.6.14 of this report. 

14.11 Block Model Setup/Parameters 

Block model was created using MineSight™ software package to generated a grid of 

regular blocks for estimating tonnes and grades. Since the different deposits are very 

spaced it was not convenient to create a single block model as it will result on useless 

time and digital memory consumption during models handling. For this reason, a block 

model was created for each of the six (6) deposits. Block sizes used is X = 20 m, Y = 5 m 

and Z = 10 m. It is the same that those used in the 2010 estimate. Sizes used do not 

respect the rule of thumb according which block size should optimally be comprised

between 1/3 to 1/5 of the averaged drilling spacing. Y and Z sizes were selected to better 

control ore contacts and conform to mining equipment size. However, those sizes appear 

to be small comparatively to the drilling spacing and may create an artificial precision in 

blocks grade even if the average grade of all blocks will not change. Block model 

parameters are labelled in Table 14.5. 

Table 14.5 – Blocks Model Parameters 

14.12 Structural Domains for Interpolation 

Due to the deformed nature of the mineralization in some deposits it was necessary to 

define structural domains in order to be able to interpolate all blocks within mineralized 

envelopes. Table 14.6 summarizes for each deposit domain(s) used with their orientation 

in azimuth and dip.

14.13 Resource Estimate 

The Duncan Lake resource was estimate per block basis using the Inverse Distance 

Squared Method (IDW2) which Met-Chem believes is appropriate in estimating resource 

of deposits showing a good geological continuity on strike and along strike such as 

Banded Iron Formations. Three interpolation pass were used in the estimation. Pass were 

implemented in the way that blocks better informed are first interpolated. Informing data 

refer to search ellipse parameters, minimum and maximum number of composites to 

interpolate a given block and the maximum number of composites that could be 

considered per hole. The consideration of a minimum number of composites to 

interpolate a block for a given pass combined with the maximum number of composites 

per holes allow implicitly determining the minimum number of drill holes when coding 

that pass.  

14.14 Resource Classification 

Interpolation pass defined in resource estimate were used to classify automatically all 

blocks that were interpolated. Blocks interpolated using first pass were classified as 

measured resources. Blocks interpolated with the second pass were classify as indicated 

resource while blocks interpolated using third pass were classify as inferred resource. 

Interpolation parameters used for those pass (Measured, Indicated and Inferred) are 

displayed in Table 14.7.

Table 14.7 – Interpolation and classification parameters 

Ellipse basis parameters were gathered from the variograms analysis and reflect grade 

continuity which is also a confidence factor like the drilling spacing. Mineral resource 

classification is based on certainty and continuity of geology and grades. In addition to 

quantitative confidence factors above presented Met-Chem has also considered 

qualitative confidence factors such as QA/QC results, industry practices for such 

commodity and Met-Chem abundant experience with similar types of mineralization.  

Mineral resource statement is made using a cut-off of 16% head Fe. This cut-off has been 

determined to be appropriate at this stage of the project. In the 2010 resource estimation 

3 cut-offs, 16% Fe, 18% Fe and 20% Fe, were selected to simulate tonnage and grade 

variation. Results show slow variation in tonnage and grade. This is typical for taconite 

deposits as that react slower to cut-off variation. Met-Chem recommends as further step 

to conduct a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) in order to analyse the economic 

potential of the Duncan Lake project.

Mineral Resource classification is based on the level of confidence on the continuity of 

geology and grades in the deposit. Areas more densely drilled are usually better known 

than areas with sparser drilling. Due to the uncertainty attached to Inferred Mineral 

Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resourced will 

be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued 

exploration. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 

economic viability.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

20.1 Environmental Considerations 

The Duncan Lake Iron Deposits lies within two orientated drainage system, the Beaver 

river watershed oriented westward which includes the Duncan lake and Esprit lake sub-

basins and the Desaulniers lake watershed oriented eastward through the Robert Bourassa 

reservoir. The Desaulniers lake watershed was, twenty years ago a sub basin of the Fort 

George River which has been flooded by the construction of the Robert Bourassa 

reservoir. The Desaulnier lake natural downstream has been modified to discharge into an 

artificial lake. This artificial lake is pumped by Hydro-Quebec pump station in the Robert 

Bourassa reservoir. On the western side of the mining site, the Duncan Lake and Esprit 

lake watersheds, which are sub basin of the Beaver River, are natural watersheds. 

No hydrometric stations have yet been established within the mine study area. Initial data 

has been collected in three gauging stations in 2011 and 2012. Two limnimeters stations 

(water depth measurement) have been installed one in Esprit Lake and the other in 

Desaulnier Lake. Data from the limnimeters have been collected since their installation in 

2011.  

Groundwater samples have been collected in 2011 and 2012 in the area of the mining 

site. Studies of the ecosystem and vegetation present in the Duncan lake project area were 

also conducted in 2011.  

There are no environmental liabilities mentioned in GESTIM management system, and 

no known environmental concerns mentioned on the DLIOP. Met-Chem is not aware of 

any environmental liabilities on the site. No field camp was installed for 2010-2011 and 

2011-12 environmental surveys.  

During a site visit in August 2012, no contaminated soil by oil or gasoline was observed.  

Century Iron ore corp. has ensured that all exploration programs on the property has and 

will be conducted in an environmentally friendly manner. 

20.2 Permitting and social community impact 

20.2.1 Overview 

The Duncan Lake Iron project (the "Project") is subject to the Québec Environmental 

Assessment act and the Canadian environmental assessment act. The former requires that 

large projects undergo an environmental assessment and obtain an Environmental 

Assessment certificate before they can proceed. The latter applies when a federal 

department or agency is required to make a decision on a proposed project such as 

issuing a permit, licence or authorization. 

20.2.2 Québec Environmental Assessment process 

Québec Environmental Quality Act ("EQA") comprises two Chapters, the first gives 

general provision and the second gives provisions applicable to the James Bay and 



Century Iron Mines Corporation / Augyva Mining Resources Inc.

  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2011-031\Texte\Rapports\Duncan Lake NI 43-101-R1.docx 

Northern Québec Region. According to Article 153 of the EQA, mining projects are 

automatically subject to an environmental assessment and review procedure.  

The Québec EA process is initiated when the Project Notice is provided in a prescribed 

format 
1
 to the Ministère de l'Environnement, du développement durable et des parcs -

MDDEP (Department of Sustainable development, Environment and parks). Usually, the 

government will issue its guidelines for the Environmental Impact assessment (EIA) 

within three months of receiving the project notice (all documents must be provided in 

French). The EIA is reviewed for sufficiency, and the proponent will provide any 

additional information if required, before it is made available for public review.  The 

public review is conducted by the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement 

(BAPE). All documents are made public for a 45-day period during which a person, a 

group or a municipality can request a public hearing from the MDDEP. The Minister 

determines if a public hearing is warranted, in which case the BAPE organizes public 

hearings in affected areas. Based on the Report from the BAPE (if required) and the 

MDDEP review, the Minister of the Environment makes recommendations to 

government to either authorize the Project (with or without modifications and conditions) 

or reject it. Before implementation of the Project, the proponent must submit its plans and 

specifications to the MDDEP regional office in order to obtain sectionals certificates of 

authorization
2
 under Section 22 of the Environmental Quality act (EQA). Generally, the 

duration of the process is a maximum of 15 months, excluding the preparation of the EIA 

itself.  

In accordance with the JBNQA, Chapter II of the EQA includes specific provisions for 

Baie-James and Nord-du-Québec regions. A keystone aspect of the environmental 

assessment procedures for these regions is the prescription for active participation of the 

Cree, Inuit or Naskapi nations. 

Table 20.1 shows a preliminary list of Quebec authorizations, licences and permits that 

CCIO will be required to obtain. The permit requirements will be reviewed and updated 

as the project advances through the environmental assessment and permitting process.

 Requirements for environmental and social impact assessments of mining projects are further refined in Directive 

019 (MDDEP 2012b).

20.2.3 The Federal Environmental Assessment process 

Federal permits and approvals that may be required for a mine/mill operation include 

approval to alter, disrupt or destroy fish habitat (HADD) or to alter navigability within 

navigable waters. A Comprehensive Study level of EA will be required, pursuant to 

Section 16 of the Comprehensive Study list regulation: 

"The proposed construction, decommissioning or abandonment of (a) metal mine, other 

than a gold mine, with an ore production capacity of 3,000 t/d or more". 

Table 20.2 shows a preliminary list of the required federal authorizations, licences and 

permits that CCIO will be required to operate the project. The project will be subject to 

the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER) enabled by the Fisheries act. The 

regulations require CCIO to achieve the specified effluent discharge standards, to 

implement a comprehensive Environmental effects monitoring program, and to provide 

compensation for the harmful alteration of fish habitat.

20.2.4 Community Relations 

Chisasibi is the largest Cree community on Eeyou Istchee territory, with a population 

reaching 3,987 in 2009 (MSSS 2009). The population is composed of approximately 

3,800 members of the Cree nation, about 150 Inuit and 300 non-native people (Cree 

Nation of Chisasibi (CNC) 2012). 

Chisasibi is a young dynamic community located on the eastern shore of James Bay, 

which has continued to grow since its relocation in 1980-81 from the nearby island of 

Fort George, located at the discharge of La Grande River in James bay (CNC 2012). This 

island was used during centuries by the nomadic Cree nation for summertime assemblies 

and it was later known as Fort George. 

As a result of negotiations between the Crees and the Québec Government over the James 

Bay Power Project, the Fort George Relocation Corporation was formed to manage the 

relocation and the construction of the present town site in Chisasibi. Chisasibi is 

accessible by road and plane. It is connected to the Route de la Baie James by a 90 km 

paved road running parallel to the La Grande River.  

The DLIP area is located 80 km east of Chisasibi, on traditional trap lines of the 

community. The Chisasibi Band Council is in charge of the local community civil service 

and community lands. On category IA lands, the councils can adopt regulations on many 

issues that concerns land use land management, environment and other issues related to 

the community development. 

Radisson is the closest non-Cree community to the Duncan Lake area. It was originally 

founded in the 1970s in the beginning of the La Grande hydro-electric complex 

construction and reached a population of about 2,500 in the main phase of the 

construction. Radisson has the status of locality since 1994. The locality has the 

essentials infrastructures and equipments to accommodate a population of about 2,500 

residents. At the end of the construction phase, in 1995, the town experienced a 

significant decline in population reaching as low as 352 permanent residents in 2005. 

Temporary residents (from Hydro-Quebec maintenance staff) are estimated to a total of 

300 persons. Radisson is connected to southern Quebec by the La Grande airport.

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

There is no mining activity in the area according to MRNF Gestim claim management 

system. There is no mining property or claims adjacent to the DLIP. However, an 

exclusion block controlled by Hydro-Québec extends across part of the DLIP group of 

claims and may affect potential development of Deposits 1, 2, and 6. 

The closest mining property to the DLIP claims is the Duncan Property owned by NQ 

Resources Inc. with offices in Laval and Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. This property is made 

up of two blocks totalling 139 map designated claims covering 7,117 ha. It is located to 

the northwest of the DLIP claims and has no common boundary with the DLIP. The NQ 

Resources' property is described as an Au, Ag, Cu and Zn prospect within sericite schists 

and carbonate.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS  

The DLIP is situated close to Radisson, in northern Québec, is crossed by paved Highway 

109, a power line and 40% of the area is underlain by water bodies. 

The results from the magnetic survey data and the drill program completed in 2008-2009 

have allowed the design of a drill program aimed at augmenting the resources and their 

confidence level on Deposits 3 and 4, and initiating delineating Deposit 6.  

Cumulatively, the drilling program of 2011-2012 and the data from the 2008-2009 holes 

have allowed defining three quarters of the resources in Deposits 3, 4 and 6 in the 

Measured and Indicated categories. The two drill programs have been successful in 

providing sufficient data on all six DLIP Deposits to produce a new (Deposits 3, 4 and 6) 

or updated (Deposits 1, 2 and 5) mineral resource estimate under the Canadian NI 43-101 

rules. The DLIP deposits that are part of the present study contain an estimated total 

Measured and Indicated resources of 1,050 Mt at 24.42% Fe, and 563 Mt of Inferred 

resources grading 27.97% Fe. 

Deposit 3 is made up of essentially two thick BIF units arranged as a large-scale, very 

shallowly plunging, tight synform-antiform system. The other Deposits appear to be 

steeply dipping tabular, parallel bodies, either repeated by isoclinal folding or emplaced 

by stacking. Felsic intrusive rocks have cut all the BIF units, but have been so heavily 

injected into Deposit 6 as to dilate the BIF units. 

The database includes more than 9,000 head analyses from the 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 

drill programs and results for Davis Tube tests on 843 samples. Density determinations 

were performed on 3,107 mineralized samples. The reliability of the analytical results is 

ensured by thorough QA-QC system aimed at monitoring the laboratories and several 

passes of verification of the information populating the master database. The 

shortcomings affecting the database, principally in the rock codes of the main lithological 

units and the labeling of the QC samples, have largely been fixed; eventually leaving 

reliable sets of data. Yet, one aspect of the resources estimate that deserves better 

attention is the low number of available Davis Tube tests that Met-Chem believes should 

reach 50% of the total sample population in order to generate a high level of confidence 

in the regression model and thus provide a better estimate of the overall Davis Tube 

Weight Recovery of the DLIP iron mineralisation. 

Preliminary metallurgical tests and Davis Tube tests results show the DLIP iron 

mineralisation to be composed mostly of magnetite and to contain very low levels of 

deleterious elements, except for elevated sulphur certainly originating from the 

widespread occurrence of pyrite and subordinate amounts of other sulphides. Sulphur 

seems to report to the tails in the Davis Tube tests and its acid-generating potential is 

under study.

The present mineral resource estimation is compliant with the requirements of NI 43-101 

and Met-Chem believes it will be a sound foundation for the Preliminary Economic 

Assessment that is being completed by Met-Chem.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

The DLIP is currently the subject of a Preliminary Economic Assessment by Met-Chem. 

Provided this study indicates a reasonable prospect for the DLIP deposits to become an 

economically and technically viable operation, Met-Chem recommends to advance the 

project to the Pre-Feasibility stage. To that end, additional work will be required to 

upgrade the reliability of certain parameters and of parts of the mineral resources base.  

The main recommendations entail: 

• Increase the percentage of Measured and Indicated category relative to the Inferred 

resources within Deposits 1 and 3 by additional diamond drilling; 

• As part of the same drill program, firm up the definition of the geometry of Deposit 

3, particularly the SE limb and the contact at depth of the synform; 

• Investigate by a first pass of drilling some of the magnetic anomalies near the main 

deposits, such as the N-S trending anomalies of Deposits 3 and 6, or the anomaly 

branching off the north of Deposit 4; 

• Increase the number of Davis Tube tests to 50% of the samples, in order to increase 

the confidence level of the regression model and provide a better overall estimation 

of the Davis Tube Weight Recovery for the deposits; 

• Determinate magnetic Fe from Davis Tube and Satmagan tests on the same samples 

in order to calculate a correlation between the two and later switch to Satmagan 

only to assess magnetic Fe, which is a cheaper method; 

• Detailed Mineralogy of Feed; 

• Concentrate  & Tailings, Grindability test to evaluate variability of the Ore; 

• Additional bench scale testwork; 

• Pilot Plant investigation; 

• Complete Waste & Tailings characterization (including leaching test and dynamic 

test); 

• Settling & Filtration test work; 

• Pulp rheology; 

• Pellet feed characterization; 

• Initiate a geotechnical study to assess rock quality to support final pit wall, as well 

as hydrogeological and hydrological studies; 

• Use certified blank material to monitor the laboratory performance and commercial 

standards with at least one with a certified Fe values close to the cut-off grade and 

one to the mode; 

• Additional metallurgical tests will be necessary, such as: S. G., Mineral 

Characterization, Size Distribution, Bulk Density Determination, Static Thickening, 

Dynamic Thickening, Pulp Rheology, Vacuum Filtration, Pressure Filtration.
