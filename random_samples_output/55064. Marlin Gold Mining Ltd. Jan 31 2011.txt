Summary (Item 3) 
Property Description and Location 

The El Compas gold and silver property ("The Property") is located in the state of Zacatecas, 
Mexico, approximately 1.7 kilometers south of the city of Zacatecas, and is centered at UTM 
747,193E, 2515482N, within the WGS84 Zone 13 coordinate system. The Property is accessible 
from Zacatecas City by two-wheel drive vehicle via paved and gravel roads in good condition.  

The Property consists of 17 semi-contiguous claims totaling approximately 2,740 hectares. One 
additional claim has been applied for by the Company at the Mexican Department of Mines and 
is pending approval (approximately 150 hectares). The El Compas and El Orito resource areas 
are located near the center of the property, entirely within the El Compas, El Orito and Don Luis 
del Oro claims.  

Ownership 

Ten of the 17 claims comprising the El Compas property are 100% owned by Oro Silver 
Resources Ltd's Mexican affiliate, Minera Oro Silver de Mexico S.A. de C.V. The remaining 
eight concessions are under assignment-of-rights and option-to-purchase agreements between the 
underlying owners and Minera Oro Silver. In all instances involving agreements the Company 
has the right to acquire a 100% interest in the exploration and mining rights to these properties. 
All of the agreements include staged cash and/or share payments, and some are subject to 
minimum work commitments and NSR clauses also.  

To date the company has made several large (>$50,000) cash option payments: 

 The Company can acquire the remaining 49% interest by completing additional staged 
payments to the owner totaling $364,240 (including value added tax) by December 4, 
2011. Payments made to date also resulted in the acquisition of the 100% interest in the 
exploration and mining rights to three adjacent claims previously optioned to the 
Company (El Orito, La Virgen, Ampleacion Al Compas) by the same owner of the El 
Compas claim. 

 A total of $380,000 has been paid to Exploraciones del Altiplano, in staged payments 
through August, 2010 under an exploration with option-to-purchase agreement with the 
owner of the mining rights to six mining concessions (Don Luis del Oro, La Virgen 2, La 
Casi Virgen 2, La Casi Virgen 3 – Fracc. A, La Casi Virgen 3 – Fracc. B, and La Casi 
Virgen 6). Work commitments consisting of 1,000 meters of drilling and $200,000 in 
exploration expenditure have also been completed to date. The company can acquire a 
100% interest in the six mining concessions by completing additional staged cash 
payments totaling $930,000 and work commitments totaling $500,000 by August 22, 
2012. 

 A total of $ 300,000 has been paid to the owner in staged payments through July 2009, 
under an option-to-purchase agreement, to acquire a 100% interest in the mining rights to 
five concessions (El Sol, Ana Camila, Ana Camila, Ana Camila Fracc. 1, Ana Camila 
Fracc. 1).

Geology and Mineralization 

The Zacatecas Mining District covers a belt of epithermal and mesothermal vein deposits that 
contain silver, gold and base metals (copper, lead and zinc) in the southern Sierra Madre 
Occidental Physiographic Province in north-central Mexico. The dominant structural features 
that localize mineralization are of Tertiary age, and are interpreted to be related to the 
development of a volcanic center and to northerly trending basin-and-range structures. The 
Zacatecas Mining District occurs in a structurally complex setting, associated with siliceous 
subvolcanic and volcanic rocks underlain by sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. The 
geologic units of the Zacatecas area include Triassic metamorphic rocks of the Zacatecas 
Formation and overlying basic volcanic rocks of the Upper Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous 
Chilitos Formation. 

The veins at El Compas strike predominantly north and northwest and are hosted partly in 
volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Chilitos formation and partly in overlying volcanic rocks 
of the La Virgen formation. At least five low sulphidation epithermal veins were historically 
exploited by several small shafts located within the El Compas and El Orito concessions for gold 
and silver.  

Exploration  

The area with the largest historical workings, the El Compas Adit Zone, was selected by the 
Company as the principal exploration target. Widely spaced exploration drill holes by previous 
operators indicated that mineralization in the El Compas vein, which hosts the Adit Zone, and 
other subsidiary veins extend well below the limit of historical workings and possibly below the 
contact zone between Chilitos formation and overlying La Virgen formation lithologies.  

During Phase 1 drilling by Oro Silver the overall objective of the program was the delineation of 
known ore chutes to greater depth, and the evaluation of parallel structures comprising the El 
Compas and El Orito vein systems. An additional objective was the discovery of one or more 
new, and potentially economic mineralized chutes within the El Compas and El Orito vein 
systems, and a preliminary evaluation of their size.  

During Phase 2 drilling by Oro Silver the overall objective of the program was to expand the 
resource on strike and down dip beyond the currently defined limits where it was still open, 
increase the amount of indicated resources from the inferred resources category by infill drilling, 
increase the confidence level in areas of high grade mineralization and better understand their 
geometry through close spaced drilling, and finally test the potential for high grade gold and 
silver mineralization at significantly deeper levels than in the past. 

Development and Operations 

Between November 2007 and March 2008 Oro Silver completed a 5,400 meter Phase 1 diamond 
drilling program that evaluated a number of known ore chutes and prospective target zones 
hosted in the El Compas and El Orito vein systems.  

Drilling established the down-dip extent of the El Compas Adit zone ore chute for as much as 
200 meters below surface and 150 meters below deepest historical workings, and horizontally on 
strike for over 200 meters, while wide spaced drilling tested the cross-strike potential of the El 
Compas vein system, and evaluated the potential for additional chutes on strike to the north and 
south of the Adit zone. Drilling completed at the El Orito vein target confirmed potential ore 
grade mineralization for 200 meters on strike, and up to 100 meters below surface.

Between June and December 2009 Oro Silver completed an additional 2,500 meters of diamond 
drilling that further evaluated the mineral potential of the El Compas and El Orito vein systems 
both on strike and at depth. The main objectives at El Orito were to extend mineralization south 
on strike, and at El Compas to infill drill the main mineralized portion of the El Compas vein 
below and adjacent to the historical workings where there were significant gaps in the existing 
drill pattern, as well as expand the resource potential at the margins where there was insufficient 
drilling. One additional hole tested the EC4 vein.  

Expansion drilling at the El Compas Adit zone extended near surface mineralization to the north 
and also discovered the continuation of the high grade ore chute to the deepest level yet at 200 
meters below surface. Infill drilling gaps immediately below the historic mine workings 
intersected some of the highest gold and silver grades ever within the El Compas ore chute.  
Wide spaced drill holes completed at the El Orito vein intersected near surface ore grade 
mineralization for an additional 200 meters on strike to the south of holes completed in 2008, 
bringing the total mineralized portion of the vein to 350 meters.   

During 2010 Oro Silver completed an additional 3,400 meters of diamond drilling in two rounds. 
The first stage consisted of deep drilling several holes that tested the El Compas vein and other 
structures at depths of 300 to 700 meters below surface. The second round consisted of close-
spaced drilling that evaluated the continuity and geometry of the main high grade ore chutes 
hosted in the El Compas and El Orito vein systems. 

Close spaced drilling confirmed the continuity of high grade mineralization within the highest 
grade portions of the El Compas and El Orito ore chutes. Deep drilling intersected the El 
Compas vein and other important structures at their target depths, in some instances greater than 
700 meter below surface, and confirmed that the structures are continuous, as well as highly 
predictable to considerable depths. 

Resource Estimation for the El Compas Project 

2008 Initial Resource Estimate 

An initial NI 43-101 compliant resource for the El Compas and the El Orito veins was estimated 
by Marc Jutras, M.A.Sc., P.Eng. (BCGold Corp), and audited by independent consultant Robert 
De L'Etoile, M.A.Sc., P.Eng. (SGS-Geostat Ltd.). The resource estimate was based on historic 
drilling completed by Minera Hochschild in 2005, and by Oro Silver in 2007-08. A total of 48 
drill holes were utilized for the estimation of the mineral resources; 32 were drilled by Oro 
Silver, and 16 holes by MHM. Resources at both cut-off grades are shown in Table 1.1. The 
technical report is available on the SEDAR website.

The sample intervals were composited to 1-metre lengths. Grades were capped at 25.0 g/t for 
gold and 300.0 g/t for silver. Gold and silver grades were interpolated into a 1 X 5 X 1 meter (X, 
Y, Z) block model using ordinary kriging. A search ellipsoid with variable azimuth and dip 
angles was used in the grade estimation process to better characterize the grade distribution 
within the mineralized veins. 

The El Compas and El Orito veins contain 86% and 14% respectively, of the gold-equivalent 
inferred resource ounces, while the El Compas vein contains 100% of the indicated resource. The 
average true widths are 7.2 meters for the El Compas vein and 3.3 meters for the El Orito vein. 

2011 Updated Resource Estimate 

Oro Silver has produced an updated resource estimate for the El Compas and El Orito veins 
based on historic drilling completed by Minera Hochschild in 2005, and by Oro Silver in 2007-
2010. In total 86 diamond drill holes were drilled by the two companies that tested the El 
Compas and El Orito vein systems along their strike length, and of these 83 holes were utilized 
in the updated mineral resource estimate; 61 holes were drilled by Oro Silver, and 25 holes by 
MHM. In comparison the 2008 resource estimate utilized a combined total of 48 diamond drill 
holes; 32 by Oro Silver and 16 by MHM. 

Recommended Work Program Budget 

SRK is of the opinion that the project has merit, and recommends the following work programs 
as identified and costed in Table 19.2.1.  Estimated costs total US$1,125,000.

1.2.1 Site Visit 

Allan Moran (SRK) conducted a site visit to the El Compas property on December 15, 2010, 
when he visited vein exposures in outcrops and underground. He also examined drilling core 
intervals for verification  with core logs and assay data for select drillholes stored at Oro 
Mining's office in Zacatecas.  

1.3 Reliance on Other Experts 

SRK's opinion contained herein is based on information provided to SRK by Oro throughout the 
course of SRK's investigations, which in turn reflect various technical and economic conditions 
at the time of writing.  Given the nature of the mining business, these conditions can change 
significantly over relatively short periods of time.  Consequently, actual results may be 
significantly more or less favorable.   

This report includes technical information that may require subsequent calculations to derive 
sub-totals, totals and weighted averages.  Such calculations inherently involve a degree of 
rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error.  Where these occur, SRK does not 
consider them to be material.   

In preparing this report, the authors reviewed the available geological reports, maps, and 
miscellaneous technical papers listed in Section 19, References, as well as relying on personal 
experience with the subject deposits.   

All of the historic data relied upon in this study, such as drill core, drill data, assay certificates, 
and other reports, were obtained by Oro from Mr. Antonio Alvarado Reyes, owner of the El 
Compas claim, as part of an agreement between the two parties. The information was provided to 
Mr. Alvarado by Minera Hochschild de Mexico S.A. de C.V (MHM)upon completion of their 
2005 exploration program. The historic drill data and reports were produced by MHM, and the 
assay certificates were from ALS Chemex. Core drilling was performed by Tecmin Servicios 
S.A. de C.V., of Fresnillo, Zacatecas, Mexico. 

Additional reports prepared by MHM in 2005, or consultants contracted by MHM, and 
referenced in this study, were obtained by the Company from Exploraciones Del Altiplano S.A 
de C.V., as part of an agreement between the two parties. 

Phase 1 diamond core drilling carried out on behalf of Oro was performed by Tecmin Servicios 
S.A. de C.V., of Fresnillo, Zacatecas, Mexico, and by Canrock Drilling Services, of San Luis 
Potosi, San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Phase 2 diamond core drilling was performed by BDW 
International Drilling, of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, and reverse circulation drilling was 
performed by Drift de Mexico, S.A de C.V., of Queretaro, Queretaro, Mexico.

Diamond core and channel samples were submitted directly to Inspectorate de Mexico S.A. de 
C.V. for preparation in Durango Mexico, and analysis in Reno, Nevada, USA. Check assays 
were analyzed at Acme Lab in Vancouver, Canada. 

Survey work was performed by Mineria, Geologia y Topografia, of Zacatecas, Mexico 
("MGTZ"), contractor to Oro, using a Sokkia SET 230R Total Station and/or Ashtech Promark3 
differential geographic positioning system instrument. MGTZ surveyed a baseline, all drill collar 
locations, all underground openings, the El Compas ramp, and all underground channel sample 
locations. It also completed a detailed topographic survey over the El Compas and El Orito 
resource areas at 1m contour spacing.  

MGTZ was also contracted to manage drilling related field logistics such as preparation of 
environmental permit documents, negotiation of trespass rights, drill site preparation, drill 
moves, drill site remediation, and to perform other exploration related work such as underground 
channel sampling, diamond drill core geological and geotechnical logging, core sawing and 
sample bagging under the direct supervision of Oro geologists.  

A Legal survey of the El Compas, El Orito, Ampliacion El Compas, and La Virgen claim 
boundaries was completed in May 2007 (Terrazas and Meza, 2007). 

The metallurgical results presented in this study are from tests performed in 2008 by SGS 
Laboratory at Lakefield, Ontario, Canada. 

Mineral title due diligence, Mexican legal and regulatory compliance, and nature and extent of 
underlying agreements were conducted by Diaz, Bouchot y Raya, from Mexico City, council to 
the Company in Mexico. 

1.3.1 Sources of Information 

Historic information used to prepare this report was obtained from maps, long and cross sections, 
data tables and documents prepared by MHM between April and December, 2005. Additional 
information relating to exploration in the El Compas area came from studies prepared by 
consultants for MHM, and from other sources. Documents used in the preparation of this report 
are presumed by the authors as accurate and complete in all aspects and are referenced in the

2 Property Description and Location 
Portions of Section 2 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El Compas Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

2.1 Property Location 

The El Compas property comprises approximately 2,740ha in Central Zacatecas state and is 
centered about UTM coordinates 747,193E, and 2,515,482N, at a mean elevation of 2,430 meters 
(Figure 2-1). It is located in the El Orito mining district, municipality of Zacatecas, Zacatecas 
State, Mexico, approximately 1.7km south of the city of Zacatecas (population 125,000).  

The El Compas property covers approximately 2.4km of strike length over the El Compas vein 
system and 1.2km of strike length over the El Orito vein system, two of the more important 
mineralized structures in the district. These structures host numerous historical workings, as well 
as the current El Compas and El Orito vein resources. Other mineralized structures exist on the 
property and have been investigated by Oro; the majority of which lie within a one to two 
kilometer wide by ten kilometer long corridor that strikes from northwest to southeast across of 
the property 

2.2 Mineral Titles 

The El Compas property consists of 17, semi-contiguous mineral claims covering approximately 
2,430ha. The El Compas and El Orito resource areas are located within the 28ha El Compas 
claim (Title No. 218370), the 9ha El Orito claim (Title No. 220278), and the 127ha Don Luis del 
Oro claim (Title No. 223882). Details of these and the other claims are summarized in Table 
2.2.1, and claim locations are shown in Figure 2-2. The mineral rights to one additional 
concession located along the western margin of the claim block were recently acquired in a 
lottery and are being applied for by Oro at the Direccion General de Minas (approximately 
300ha). There are small claims not owned by Oro that are internal to the El Compas Property; 
however, none of these are located in the immediate area of interest. 

Mexican law requires that the boundaries of a mineral concession be established by a registered 
Mexican Mineral Concession Surveyor. The mineral concession corners are typically marked by 
a cement cairn inscribed with concession numbers.  Four concessions, including El Compas and 
El Orito, have had their boundaries surveyed and determined to be correct (Terrazas and Meza, 
2007).

2.3 Location of Mineralization 

The El Compas and El Orito resources are located near the center of the property, entirely within 
the El Compas, El Orito and Don Luis Del Oro claims. The near surface portion of the El 
Compas vein resource lies entirely within the El Compas concession.  At depth, it dips west 
towards and onto the Don Luis del Oro claim. The northern portion of the El Orito vein resource 
is located within the El Orito claim, while the southern portion lies within the Don Luis del Oro 
claim.

Oro Mining Ltd.  2-3 
El Compas Property   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 
 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  January 30, 2011 
El_Compas_NI 43-101 TR_343200.010_013_MLM   

Diaz, Bouchot y Raya (Durango 195-502, Colonia Roma Norte, 06700 México, Distrito 
Federal), legal counsel to Oro, has reviewed the agreements on its behalf.  

On April 21, 2007,Oro, through its 100% owned affiliate Minera Oro Silver de Mexico S.A de 
C.V., signed an Option-to-Purchase agreement with Contracuna I S.A. de C.V. ("Contracuna"), a 
Mexican company controlled by Mr. Francisco Gutierrez Castorena, which at the time held 
100% of the exploitation rights to the El Compas concession through a rental mining agreement 
with the underlying concession owner Antonio Alvarado Reyes (Oro Silver Resources Ltd., 
2007a). The Option-to-Purchase agreement also included the right to acquire three adjacent 
concessions owned by Contracuna totaling 98.3517ha, namely El Orito, La Virgen, and 
Ampliacion Al Compas. The Company paid $42,500 on signing to execute the agreement. On 
Nov. 11, 2007, the company paid an additional $800,000 to acquire the 100% interest in the 
mining rental agreement and the three concessions from Contracuna (Oro Silver Resources Ltd., 
2007d). Contracuna completed small scale underground mining at El Compas until the final 
payment was made, at which time all mining activity was halted. The rental mining agreement is 
valid for 10 years from the date of signing, and expires on July 12, 2012.  

On June 4, 2007, Oro signed an Option-to-Purchase agreement with Mr. Antonio Alvarado 
Reyes, the owner of the El Compas concession (Oro Silver Resources Ltd., 2007b), whereby 
$100,000 was paid upon signing of the formal agreement, and Oro could acquire 100% 
ownership of the concession by making payments totaling $2.6 million, staged over a 2 year 
period from the signing date. By May 23, 2008,Oro earned a 51% equity interest in the property 
by making payments totaling $1.6 million to Mr. Alvarado (Oro Silver Resources Ltd., 2008a). 
On December 2, 2008, as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis, a modified payment 
schedule was negotiated with Mr. Alvarado, in which a Mr. Alvarado allowed a cash payment of 
$800,000 due on December 4, 2008 to be deferred until December 19, 2008.  

On December 12, 2008, an agreement to renegotiate was signed between the two parties in order 
to establish new payment terms, and on December 18, 2008 an agreement was signed, which 
extended the schedule for the balance of payments, and added an additional $60,000 payment in 
the form of cash and shares at Oro's discretion (bringing the total purchase price for the El 
Compas concession to $2,760,000), until December 5, 2011. To date, Oro has made payments 
totaling $2,446,000 to Mr. Alvarado. Upon payment of $314,000 on Dec 4, 2011, Oro became 
100% owners of the property. 

As part of the agreement with Mr. Alvarado, Oro also obtained access to approximately 5,788m 
of drill core from 20 holes, and related reporting, drilling, mapping, and sampling data. This 
work was performed in 2005 by MHM, and information was provided to Mr. Alvarado on 
completion of the program. MHM reported US$709,490 in expenditures on the Property 
(Martinez Mendoza, 2005).  

On July 5, 2007, Oro signed an Option-to-Purchase agreement with David Alejandro Espinoso 
Duenas, for 5 mineral concessions totaling 320.4743 hectares that expand Oros's land position in 
the El Compas area (Oro Silver Resources Ltd., 2007c). The concessions are Ana Camila, Ana 
Camila, Ana Camila Fracc 1, Ana Camila Fracc 1, and El Sol. $50,000 was paid upon signing of 
the formal agreement. Oro can acquire 100% ownership of the concession by making payments 
totaling $300,000, staged over a 2 year period from the signing date. On July 5, 2009, the final 
payment was made to Mr. Espinoso and Oro became the 100% owner of the concessions. 



Oro Mining Ltd.  2-4 
El Compas Property   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 
 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  January 30, 2011 
El_Compas_NI 43-101 TR_343200.010_013_MLM   

On Aug 22, 2008, Oro signed a Binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") with Exploraciones Del 
Altiplano S.A de C.V. that established the terms of an exploration agreement and purchase 
option on six mineral concessions (Oro Silver Resources Aug 2008b). The six concessions to be 
included in the final agreement and covered by the LOI are adjacent to and expand the current 
land holdings of Oro at El Compas, and total some 1,285ha. The six concessions are Don Luis 
Del Oro, La Virgen 2, La Casi Virgen 2, La Casi Virgen 3 Fracc. A & B, and La Casi Virgen 6. 
The acquisition terms require Oro to pay $10,000 and grant 75,000 common shares of Oro on the 
signing date, followed by cash payments totaling US$1,475,000 over a 4 year period, in addition 
to completing 1,000m of drilling within 12 months of the signing date, and to make additional 
exploration related work expenditures on the concessions totaling US$1,000,000 during the 
remainder of the 4 year agreement. By doing so, Oro will acquire a 51% interest in the properties 
by the end of year 3 and a 100% interest by the end of year 4, subject to a 3% Net Smelter 
Return (NSR), half of which can be purchased by Oro for a total of US$1,500,000.  The 
definitive agreement was signed on Oct. 24, 2008. On Aug. 10, 2009, as a result of the 2008 
global financial crisis, a modified agreement was signed between Oro and Exploraciones Del 
Altiplano, in which the original cash payment of $100,000 due at 12 months from the signing 
date was modified to a cash payment of $25,000 at 12 months from the signing date, followed by 
a cash payment of $50,000 plus $25,000 in Oro shares at 15 months from the signing date. Other 
than these changes no other changes to the original agreement occurred. As of Aug 22, 2010, a 
total of $380,000 in cash payments have been made to Exploraciones Del Altiplano. In addition, 
Oro has fulfilled the 1,000m drilling requirement, as well as completed $200,000 in exploration 
expenditures as per the agreement requirements. Upon payment of an additional $175,000 due 
Feb 22, 2011, and fulfilling a $300,000 exploration work commitment, Oro will earn a 51% 
interest in the concessions. Upon payment of an additional $755,000 in cash and fulfillment of 
$500,000 in exploration work, the Company will acquire 100% ownership in the properties, 
subject to the NSR described above. 

No other royalties, back-ins or encumbrances are known by the authors to exist on any of the 
properties. 

2.5 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 

The authors are not aware of any significant environmental issues on the Project. Numerous 
abandoned shafts, pits, and collapsed workings occur at El Compas, the majority of which have 
been secured by Oro with stone and concrete footwalls covered by metal grates and/or by 
fencing. A number of these historic workings have small waste dumps containing low 
concentrations of sulphides. An area suspected of holding old tailings has also been identified. 
Oro has not completed any environmental due diligence.  

2.5.1 Required Permits and Status 

Exploration work carried out by Oro at El Compas has been in full compliance with current 
environmental regulation. In the case of the 2007-08 drilling campaign, Oro was required to 
register a work program (Aviso de Inicio de Actividades) with the Secretary of Environment and 
Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), which it did on Nov. 9, 2007. The report was prepared by 
Joel Espinosa Rivera of Bufete de Servicios Tecnicos Forestales y de Fauna Silvestre, and 
submitted by Rolando Mendoza Pina of MGTZ, contractor to Oro. Drilling completed during 
Phase 2 exploration in 2009-10 was covered under the same work program; therefore, no 
additional actions were required.

2.5.2 Compliance Evaluation 

Oro recorded the surface conditions at El Compas on digital photos prior to commencing 
exploration activities. 

A large,  inactive quarry operation is located on the south part of the Project. The authors are 
unable to comment whether this operation conforms to Mexican environmental and mining law. 

There is potential for problems arising from the close proximity of the Project to the urban area 
of Zacatecas, although open pit and underground mining is currently taking place within, and 
very close to Zacatecas and Guadalupe.

3 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 

Portions of Section 3 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

3.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The Project is accessed by all-weather gravel road, 1.7 km from the southern part of the city of 
Zacatecas (Figure 3-1). Topography consists of rolling hills of moderate relief scattered among a 
large broad valley.  The elevation of the airport is 2,140 meters, and the city of Zacatecas lies at 
about 2,430 meters. Vegetation is dominantly cactus, maguey, sage and grass, with rare Yucca. 
Pirules line the arroyos. . 

3.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season 

The climate is typical of the high altitude physiographic Mesa Central, with a summer rainy 
season from May to September averaging 15.6°C, and dry winters from December to February, 
with an average temperature of 10°C. Total annual precipitation is about 427 millimeters, and the 
average annual temperature is about 13.6°C (www.wunderground.com).  

3.3 Physiography 

The physiography of the region is dominated by basin-and-range type topography, with broad 
north-northeast trending valleys separated by narrow mountain ranges. Zacatecas city, and the 
property, occurs in the Sierras de Zacatecas. The Graben de Calera lies to the west of the 
property. Topographic relief on the property is low.. 

3.4 Access to Property 

Zacatecas is the state capital, and with adjoining Guadalupe, are modern and fully serviced. The 
city is the second largest in the state after Fresnillo, with a population of 118,562 (2005, http: 
//www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacatecas). The Pan American highway connects the city to other 
major centers by road, and an international airport connects Zacatecas with Mexico City and the 
U.S. by daily flights. Power, water, and telecommunication are readily accessible in close 
proximity to the Project. 

3.5 Surface Rights 

The surface rights in the vicinity of the historic El Compas and El Orito mine workings are 
owned by a number of private individuals and in one case by a business entity.  

The surface rights covering the area of recent exploration by Oro, including the El Compas and 
El Orito resource areas, are owned by Jose Antonio De La Torre Duenas. A formal rental 
agreement between Oro and by Mr. De La Torre was signed on Sept. 9, 2009, valid for 2 years 
from the date of signing, which gives unlimited trespass rights to Oro within the limits of Mr. De 
La Torres 96 hectare property for the purposes of carrying out its exploration work. A total of 
$135,000 in cash payments was made to Mr. De La Torre; $50,000 on the signing date for the 
first year rent, and $84,000 on the anniversary date for the second year rent. 



Oro Mining Ltd.  3-2

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  January 30, 2011 
El_Compas_NI 43-101 TR_343200.010_013_MLM   

Internal to Mr. De La Torre's property and south of the historic El Compas Shaft mine workings, 
a large scale building stone quarry exists that is believed to be owned and operated by  Mr. Jose 
Aguirre. The area of the internal property is approximately 26ha; however no legal survey data 
has been obtained to confirm the exact location. The southern extension of the El Compas vein 
structure crosses the quarry workings. 

The surface rights adjacent to and covering the area to the east of the De La Torre property are 
owned by Alfonso Alfaro Saldivar. A formal rental agreement was signed between Oro and Mr. 
Alfaro on Oct. 15, 2009, valid for 2 years from the date of signing, which gives unlimited 
trespass rights to Oro for the purpose of carrying out its exploration work. The rental payment 
amount is $1500 per month and is paid monthly. Rental payment by Oro is obligatory during the 
first year and optional during the second year.  

The surface rights adjacent to and covering the area to the west of the De La Torre property are 
owned by Maricela Banuelos Arellano. A formal rental agreement was signed between Oro and 
the Banuelos family legal representative, Mrs. Maricela Banuelos Arellano, on Sept. 1, 2010, 
valid for 2 years from the date of signing, which gives Oro unlimited trespass rights for the 
purpose of carrying out its exploration work. The rental payment amount is $1000 per month and 
is paid monthly.  

These three surface rental agreements cover an aggregate area of approximately 380ha and are 
believed to provide adequate surface access rights to Oro for carrying out exploration work 
related to the El Compas and El Orito vein systems. It is Oro's intention to renew these longer 
term rental agreements or enter into purchase options in the near future starting with Mr. De La 
Torre. See Figure 3-1 for locations and coverage of Oro's surface rental agreements.  

Immediately west of the El Compas vein system and adjacent to the western limit of the De La 
Torre property, the surface rights are owned by Santa Rita Grupo S.A de C.V., ("Santa Rita"), a 
major land developer active in the Zacatecas city area. Santa Rita is currently active at the north 
end of the project area within the Ana Camila concession, where it owns the surface rights, and 
is developing a large-scale residential sub-division. In early 2010, part of the Santa Rita property 
immediately west of the mine entrance was cleared, possibly as ground preparation prior to 
construction, but at this time, no further work has been carried out.  

3.6 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The Project's proximity to the city of Zacatecas facilitates many local resources, such as labor 
and materials. Infrastructure carries the amenities general to city municipalities such as water, 
electricity, waste treatment, and fuel storage. 

3.6.1 Access Road and Transportation 

The road access from the city of Zacatecas is paved up to 1km from the concessions, here it 
changes to a gravel road entrance leading to the existing mining access area. All "over the road" 
means of transportation can be facilitated at the Project. 

3.6.2 Power Supply 

There is access to power via power line and transformer installations at the mine access area. The 
line capacity allows for 440V usage with conversion to 110V. This supply is currently used for 
basic dewatering of the underground workings.

4 History 
Portions of Section 4 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

The city of Zacatecas was founded in 1546, after the discovery of silver vein systems by Juan de 
Tolosa. One hundred years later, Zacatecas became Mexico's largest silver producer, and the city 
was the second largest in the country after Mexico City. As in many mining districts in Mexico, 
production ceased during the Mexican Revolution of 1910 to 1917. Production resumed in some 
areas by about 1936. Historic silver production estimates exceed 1.5 billion ounces from the 
state, and 750 million ounces from the Zacatecas district (Ponce and Clark, 1988). 

4.1 Ownership, Past Exploration and Development 

The El Orito mining district was first exploited in 1570, and intermittently thereafter to about the 
time of the Mexican Revolution (Salas Vazquez, 2001). Most historic exploitation was by small-
scale shaft mining. The two largest shafts in the property are located on the El Compas 
concession and are known as El Compas, and La Predilecta (Figure 4-1). The El Compas Shaft 
has a reported depth of 115 m (Salas Vazquez, 2001), while the depths of mining shafts on the 
northern part of the concession, and to the northeast at El Orito are unknown. Other historical 
workings are known to exist on the property but which have not yet been investigated by Oro. 
An area suspected to hold old tailings was identified below the El Compas shaft (Tarnocai, 
2007).  

Contracuna l, S.A de C.V worked the El Compas veins by underground ramp-in-ore mining from 
about 2002 until late 2007. Contracuna reports on their mine plans state about 1,215m of ramp 
development, to a depth of about 50m below portal elevation. The mining rate from 2002 until 
late-2006 was estimated by Oro to be 50 to 100 tonnes per day, with an average weighted head 
grade of 4.67g/t Au and 86.74 g/t Ag, based on incomplete records for 55,140 tonnes of ore 
shipped to the Veta Grande mill (non-NI 43-101 compliant).  

The early history of the El Compas area is poorly recorded.  Beginning in 1996,  a number of 
mining and exploration companies, and Mexican government agencies worked the claims.. 

In 1996, Monarch Resources Limited conducted exploration in the area that included 829m of 
diamond core drilling in 4 holes ("MLV" holes) that tested the El Compas 2 and Escuadra Veins, 
located about 600m east of the El Compas Vein (MHM internal data file, 2005). According to 
MHM documents, one hole is reported to have intercepted 4.31 g/t Au over 1.16m (non-NI 43-
101compliant). 

The Consejo de Recursos Mexicanos mapped and sampled the surface and underground 
exposures on the El Compas Claim in 2001 (Salas Vazquez, 2001), and produced a non-NI 43-
101 compliant resource estimate.  

Aurcana Corporation conducted exploration in the area in 2003-2004 that included 1,899m of 
diamond core drilling in 9 holes ("LVDD" holes) that further tested the El Compas 2 vein (MHM 
internal data file, 2005). One of these holes is reported to have intercepted 13.2 g/t Au over 
4.46m (non-NI 43-101compliant).

Boliden Mining Company conducted exploration in the area prior to MHM but the exact dates 
are not known (MHM internal data file, 2005). According to MHM documents, Boliden drilled 
four diamond core holes ("BDDV" holes) that targeted the El Compas 2 vein south of the 
historic Aurcana drilling. One of the holes intercepted mineralization grading 3.45 g/t Au and 25 
g/t Ag over 0.55m (non-NI 43-101 compliant). 

MHM extensively explored the El Orito district from April 2005 to March 2006. A major part of 
the program involved focused work at the El Compas vein system.  

District-wide surface exploration by MHM identified numerous targets characterized by north 
and/or northwest trending mineralized veins and faults, eight of which were tested by diamond 
drilling. In total 5,516m of drilling in 20 NQ holes were completed. Results of the drilling (non-
NI 43-101compliant) confirmed the presence of significant gold and silver grades at depth in a 
number of the target structures tested. Significant results include 15.19 g/t Au and 155 g/t Ag 
over 1.05 m from the El Compas 4 vein, located roughly 1.4 km southeast of the El Compas 
vein.  

Significant historic drilling results by the exploration companies referred to above are shown in 
Table 4.1.1. It is not known if the data is complete, and none of it is considered to be NI 43-101 
compliant.

At El Compas, MHM carried out 1:1000 scale surface mapping, and collected 60 surface outcrop 
and 469 underground channel samples for analysis. Twenty widely-spaced HQ and NQ diamond 
core holes totaling 5,788m tested the El Compas vein structure over nearly 1,000m of horizontal 
strike length, at about 25 to 50m spacing in the mine area, and about 100m spacing south of the 
mine, at depths of 60 to 400m below surface. Two more drill holes totaling 485m tested the El 
Orito vein structure.  Results of drilling confirmed the presence of significant gold and silver 
grades at depth, particularly within the Adit Zone ore chute. The results of the MHM drilling at 
El Compas were utilized in the current resource estimate. The results of MHM exploration work 
at the El Compas and El Orito veins is described in more detail in the Exploration and Drilling 
sections that follow. 

4.2 Historic Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates 

No historic mineral resources or reserves are reported here.

4.3 Historic Production 

The El Compas veins were exploited by underground ramp-in-ore mining by Contracuna from 
about 2002 until 2007. Production information was compiled by Oro (Charles Tarnocai, 2007) 
with assistance from mill staff. Oro believes the production information is incomplete. The 
mining rate since 2002 is estimated  by Oro to have been between 50 to 100 tonnes per day (Sr. 
Gutierrez, pers. comm. 2006; Unnamed, 2005a). Ore was processed at the Contracuna mill in 
Veta Grande. An average weighted head grade of 4.67g/t Au and 86.74 g/t Ag was calculated 
from incomplete records for 55,140 tonnes of ore shipped to the mill (Table 4.3.1). Samples of 
crushed ore were occasionally analyzed by Contracuna I S.A. de C.V at their Veta Grande mill-
site. Oro personnel did not observe either the sample collection or analysis methods, and the 
results are not NI 43-101 compliant. Oro considers the results an indication of grade and 
potential at El Compas.

5 Geological Setting 
Portions of Section 5 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

The city of Zacatecas lies on the northeastern margin of the Tertiary volcanic rocks of the Sierra 
Madre Occidental (SMO) geologic province. Mesozoic marine sedimentary and volcanic rocks 
of the Mesa Central geologic province are exposed to the northeast(Figure 5-1). The boundary 
zone between the Sierra Madre Occidental and Mesa Central geologic provinces is marked by 
the northwest striking Rio Santa Maria fault system (Albinson, 1988; Nieto-Samaniego et al., 
2005; Aranda-Gomez et al., 2007).  This is a major fault system extending from the city of 
Durango in the northwest, to the city of San Luis Potosi in the southeast. The Tertiary volcanic 
rocks which presumably overlay older rocks of the Mesa Central have been uplifted and eroded. 
The Rio Santa Maria fault zone also separates a region of lower elevation and lower relief to the 
north, from higher elevation and higher relief topography to the south (Figure 5-2). 

5.1 Regional Geology 

The regional geology (Figure 5-3) was mapped and described by Caballero Martinez and Rivera 
Venegas (1999) and Caballero Martinez and Rivera Venegas et al. (1999). 

Mesozoic rocks occur north and west of Guadalupe and Zacatecas. The oldest rocks in the region 
are upper Triassic phyllites, arenites, and limestone of the Zacatecas Formation, and overlying 
upper Jurassic to Cretaceous phylite, silty limestone, and volcanic rocks of the Chilitos 
Formation. The western part of the Sierra de Zacatecas is underlain by lower members of the 
Chilitos Formation, and the eastern part by volcanic rock-dominant upper members of the 
Chilitos Formation. The Chilitos and Zacatecas Formations dip gently to the north- northeast. 

Disconformably overlying the Chilitos Formation, and outcropping in Zacatecas and Guadalupe, 
is the lower Tertiary Conglomerado Rojo de Zacatecas dated at 29 to 50.9 Ma (Aranda-Gomez et 
al., 2007). This red-purple polymict conglomerate unit is correlated with the Conglomerado Rojo 
de Guanajuato, and other continental red bed occurrences in the Mesa Central. The occurrence of 
this congolmerate provides evidence of pre-Oligocene extension (Aranda-Gomez et al., 2007) 
that predates extension temporally related to volcanism of the SMO. Discordantly overlying the 
Chilitos Formation and Conglomerado Rojo de Zacatecas are felsic volcanic rocks of the SMO. 
Rocks of the SMO occur south of Zacatecas and Guadalupe, the lowermost part of which is the 
Calerilla-Guadalupe Formation (46.8 Ma), comprising a thin, discontinuous volcanic breccia. 
The La Virgen Formation (36.8 Ma) overlies the Calerilla-Guadalupe Formation, comprising 
thick-bedded ignimbrite and minor rhyolite tuff. The Los Alamitos Formation is an overlying, 
Miocene-aged ash flow with lithic fragments, up to 40m thick. Partially welded, biotite phyric 
ashflows of the Pliocene La Capilla Formation, up to 100m thick, cap the sequence. 

Tertiary felsic plugs and dykes cut all units. Intermediate plugs and dykes of Mesozoic age, 
locally known as the Roca Verde, intrude the Mesozoic sequence. Early Cenozoic to Mesozoic 
rocks have been affected by Laramide shortening, and all rocks are cut by faults related to mid to 
late Tertiary extension. Extension was episodic, occurring at 26 to 27 Ma, 24Ma, and 11Ma 
(Aranda-Gomez et al., 1998; Nieto-Samaniego et al., 1999). Tertiary faults are N-S to NNE, 
NW, and occasionally NE trending. The timing relation between these fabrics is uncertain, 
though the lack of consistent cross-cutting relations (Aranda-Gomez et al., 1989) suggests faults 



Oro Mining Ltd.  5-2

El_Compas_NI 43-101 TR_343200.010_013_MLM   

experienced coeval motion. Aranda-Gomez and others (2007) observe NW faults cut by N-S 
faults in the Zacatecas area. The timing of initial motion on the Rio Santa Maria fault may be 27 
to 32 Ma (Aranda-Gomez et al., 2007), older than extension affecting rocks of the SMO and the 
roughly 11Ma age of most N-S faulting. Red bed sedimentary sequences are suggested by the 
same workers as temporally related to the early phase of extension, and spatially related to the 
structures accommodating that extension. 

Epithermal vein systems in Mexico largely date from 48Ma to 18Ma (Camprubi et al., 2003), 
and are controlled by Tertiary extensional structural fabrics, as is volcanism of the SMO. In the 
Zacatecas region, most vein systems are closely associated with the intersection of NW and N-S 
trending faults (Aranda-Gomez et al., 2007), though the first-order control appears to be the NW 
striking fault fabrics of the Rio Santa Maria fault zone. The nearby vein systems at Fresnillo and 
Real de Angeles have been respectively dated at 32-28 Ma (Lang et al., 1988) and 45.2 Ma 
(Harder, 1987; Pearson et al., 1988), suggesting an Eocene to Oligocene age for intermediate 
sulphidation state veins in the Zacatecas area. The timing for mineralization therefore 
corresponds to the initial phases of felsic volcanism in the SMO, and motion along the northwest 
trending Rio Santa Maria fault zone. 

Zacatecas hosts low to intermediate sulphidation style vein systems, and exhalative base and 
precious metal sulphide systems (Figure 5-4). Intermediate sulphidation style vein systems (Veta 
Grande, San Acacio) occur in the Chilitos Formation. These are Ag-rich base 
metal+quartz+calcite veins and breccias, with very low Au content (typically <1 g/t Au in ore) 
and abundant sulphides. Low sulphidation style veins occur in the El Orito Zone (Zona Aurifera 
del Sur of Ocejo Paredes, 1979), and are unique to the district. They are Au-rich, Ag-poor 
(Ag/Au of about 6.7:1 to 20:1), with very low total sulphide and base metal content. Epithermal 
veins with a low sulphidation style occur in both the Chilitos Formation, and overlying felsic 
volcanic rocks of the La Virgen Formation. Exhalative sulphide mineralization (San Nicholas, 
Francisco I Madero) occur in the marine sedimentary rock sequence of the Mesa Central. 

The Cozamin deposit is described as an intermediate sulphidation style vein system, overprinted 
by an intrusion-related disseminated sulphide system (Christopher and Giroux, 2005).  

5.2 Local Geology 

The property geology has been described by Salas Vazquez (2001) and Martinez Mendoza, 
(2005), and by Tarnocai and Thiboutot (2007). 

5.2.1 Local Lithology 

The El Compas project area is underlain by andesite and phyllite of the Chilitos Formation in the 
north, and felsic volcanic rocks of the La Virgen Formation in the south and east. (Figure 5-5). 
The La Virgin Formation is a thick sequence of massive, columnar jointed Tertiary ignimbrites, 
rhyolite flows, and sandstone. Contact and fiamme measurements collected by Oro from 
ignimbrite exposures in the vicinity of the El Compas mine indicate a mean strike of 110º, 
dipping 11º to the south-southeast. Midway between the El Compas Adit and Shaft zones the 
Escuadra fault (NW1 fault in the Resource model), an important NW striking and SW dipping 
district scale structure, cuts the local stratigraphy and has juxtaposed Chilitos Formation and La 
Virgen rocks in fault contact with one another at surface.

5.2.2 Alteration 

Intense argillic alteration with strong Fe-oxide is observed at the andesite-rhyolite contact on the 
first level of the ramp. In the andesite, narrow zones of argillic alteration occur in the wallrocks 
to quartz veins and some veinlets. Chlorite and fine-grained epidote alteration of the propylitic 
zone, occurs as distal alteration associated with the quartz veins. The width of the propylitic zone 
is up to 5 times the vein width. In rhyolite, proximal wallrock alteration comprises narrow zones 
of silicification, fracture controlled Fe-oxide and argillic alteration 

5.2.3 Structure 

Numerous fault-hosted, veins occur on the Project. North-south striking faults and veins dip 
steeply west or vertical. Northwest striking faults and fault-veins dip moderate to steeply 
southwest.  

On the El Compas claim, north and northwest striking fault-veins merge across zones of 
curvilinear veins, faults, veinlets and fault-related cleavages. Fault-veins correspond to areas of 
steeper topographic gradient, suggesting fault motion has at least partially controlled topography. 
In felsic rocks, faults are characterized by narrow fault cores containing gouge, quartz-matrix 
breccias, sheeted quartz veins, and single planar veins. Mechanical deformation zones in the fault 
walls are narrow zones, and cleavage intensity and quartz veinlet density decrease away from the 
fault core. Veins occupying the fault core are typically <1m in width. Rocks of the Chilitos 
Formation are cut by more numerous faults and cleavages, and veins occupying the fault cores 
are often >1m wide. In the El Compas ramp, the anastomosing Veta Bajo and Veta Alto (referred 
to collectively as the El Compas veins by MHM) are typically separated by 2 meters of wallrock, 
and are individually 2 to 4m in width. Where these structures merge, continuous vein widths up 
to 22m are observed. Furthermore, drilling has confirmed that ore extraction from the El Compas 
UG mine comes from a steep north plunging to subvertical chute within the plane of the Veta 
Bajo and Veta Alto veins.

(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

6.1 Geological Model 

The El Compas and El Orito veins have the characteristics of a low sulphidation style epithermal 
vein system, and occur in a region characterized by numerous, high Ag-grade intermediate 
sulphidation style epithermal vein systems. 

Epithermal systems may be classified as high, intermediate, and low sulphidation styles. They 
are characterized by the sulphidation state of the hypogene sulphide mineral assemblage, and 
show general relations in volcano-tectonic setting, precious and base metal content, igneous rock 
association, proximal hypogene alteration, and sulphide abundance (ie., John, 2001; Sillitoe and 
Hedenquist, 2003). Mineralization in all types form under epizonal conditions, generally within 
2km of the paleo-surface. Veins in epithermal systems often display epizonal textures indicative 
of repetitive and sustained open-space filling, and boiling. 

Significant members of the low sulphidation style of epithermal systems include Sleeper, Midas, 
and El Penon. Those associated with bimodal basalt-rhyolite sequences and subalkaline magmas 
display illite proximal alteration zones, with adularia and local fluorite. They generally display 
low total sulphide content (<2 volume %). Base metal sulphides occur in very low abundance, 
and the mineralogical systems tend to be Au-rich. Selenides are common in some systems. The 
alkaline magma associated systems (not under consideration here) are temporally associated with 
alkaline basalt and trachyte, have roscoelite-bearing illite+adularia proximal alteration, more 
abundant sulphides (up to 10% volume), and selenides are uncommon. Both subclasses contain 
pyrrhotite, pyrite, and minor arsenopyrite. Low sulphidation epithermal systems often have 
Ag:Au ≤15, and <200 ppm Cu (Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003). 

Low sulphidation epithermal veins are generally not considered transitional to intermediate 
sulphidation state epithermal systems (Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003), although this is based 
solely on the different tectonic environments under which they may typically form. It does not 
exclude them from occurring in a similar area. Significant members of the intermediate 
sulphidation epithermal class are well represented in Mexico, and include Fresnillo and Pachuca-
Real del Monte. These are related to andesite, rhyodacite and occasionally rhyolite sequences. 
Adularia is rare to absent in the proximal alteration assemblage, and the gangue contains 
abundant, often manganiferous, carbonate. Sulphide content in veins typically exceeds 5% 
volume, and comprise pyrite, Fe-poor sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and tennanite-tetrahedrite.  
Selenides and pyrrhotite are uncommon, and Mexican examples tend to be Ag-rich, with Ag:Au 
exceeding 10:1, and often >100:1. Most significant members of both classes have vertical 
mineralized extents of <1km, often <500 m. Ore is hosted by fault-related veins and breccias, 
and elevated precious metal content occurs in plunging, lenticular zones within the plane of the 
vein ("chutes"). 

Vertical zonations in metal content occur in some low and intermediate sulphidation state 
systems (ie, Albinson et al., 2001). In systems displaying such zoning, gold, silver, mercury and 
tellurium are relatively enriched in the upper portions of the system, and base metal contents 
occur in higher concentrations at deeper levels in the system.

7 Mineralization 
Portions of Section 7 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

At the El Compas concession, northerly trending veins in the Chilitos Formation have finely 
banded, colliform, and crustiform open space fill textures. Bladed quartz after calcite textures are 
common. Veins in felsic rocks are comprised of saccharoidal to fine-grained quartz or banded 
veins. Wider veins in felsic rocks are observed in the Cantera pit and at the El Compas shaft. 
These veins show breccia and bladed quartz-after calcite textures. Calcite is observed in bands in 
large andesite-hosted quartz veins, and in veinlets distal to mineralized zones in very weakly 
propylitized rocks. Within the El Compas ramp, the widest calcite veins (>0.75m, both black and 
white coarse grained calcite) occur as northwest striking veins. Large northerly striking calcite 
veins have not been observed on surface or in the El Compas ramp; however, thick calcite-rich 
quartz veins were intersected by drilling at deeper levels below the mine and elsewhere that 
appear to correlate with the north-south striking El Compas and other veins. Sulphide abundance 
in veins rarely exceeds 5%, and is most abundant in the mineralized veins. Pyrite or pyrhottite 
are the most common sulphides. Rare sphalerite and oxide copper was observed at the 7th level 
of the El Compas ramp. Magnetite was identified in panned concentrates from the mineralized 
veins. 

Both the El Compas and El Orito vein systems experienced historic artisanal exploitation, while 
the El Compas vein has also experienced recent small scale mechanized exploitation. In both 
areas, veins may occur singularly or as sheeted zones, and can vary substantially in width along 
strike and down dip.  

7.1 Mineralized Zones 

Five veins comprise the El Compas vein system, of which at least 4 have experienced 
exploitation; the N-S striking Veta Bajo, Veta Alto (collectively the El Compas, or V1 vein), and 
the Veta Soledad (V3 vein), and the NW striking Predelicta vein (Figure 7-1). The longest veins 
have discontinuous mapped strike extents of 415m (Veta Bajo and Veta Alto) and 850m (Veta 
Soledad) or more. Numerous other veins are identified from mapping. The widest veins, and 
those that have experienced the majority of the exploitation on the property, are the north-south 
striking veins. The Predelicta vein contains more abundant calcite and is moderate to steeply 
dipping, but is otherwise similar in occurrence to the steep-dipping N-S striking veins on the 
property. Exploitation has occurred on both N-S and NW striking veins in the La Virgen 
Formation felsic volcanic rocks and the underlying Chilitos Formation volcanic and sedimentary 
rocks. Although numerous pits and small shafts occur on the El Compas veins, longitudinal 
sections show extraction was selective, occurring in two sub-vertical ore chutes; one at the El 
Compas Shaft on the N-S striking Soledad vein, and the other at the El Compas Adit on the 
parallel Veta Bajo and Veta Alto veins. These ore chutes are between 130m (El Compas shaft) 
and 250m wide (El Compas Adit). Presumably, selective exploitation occurred in areas of higher 
precious metal grade. At El Orito mineralized veins strike north and dip steeply west to vertical, 
and are hosted entirely within sediments of the Chilitos Formation. A small vertical shaft of 
uncertain depth and related waste dump attest to minor historical artisanal workings here.

7.2 Surrounding Rock Types 

At El Compas and El Orito the mineralized veins and are hosted entirely within sediments of the 
Chilitos Formation and to a lesser degree, the overlying rhyolites.  

7.3 Relevant Geological Controls 

There is evidence to suggest that ore chute development occurs along the N-S structures where 
they are intersected by NW fault-veins and vein arrays. Observations suggest the veins are wider 
in the Chilitos Formation than in the overlying rhyolite. Stockwork quartz veinlets occur at the 
base of the rhyolite. 

7.4 Type, Character and Distribution of Mineralization 

Veins are predominantly of white quartz-calcite, but abundant banded greenish chalcedonic 
quartz may also be present, as is the case for the El Compas Adit zone. Minor concentrations of 
fine disseminated pyrite and pyrrhotite are observed in some veins, as is magnetite. Fe-oxide 
occurs after pyrite and coating fracture surfaces. Black manganese oxide is also observed locally 
on fracture surfaces. 

The El Compas and El Orito veins are clearly epizonal in nature, displaying abundant bladed 
quartz-after-calcite textures indicative of shallow boiling, and banded, colloform and crustiform 
layering indicative of repetitive open-space filling. Brecciated textures are also commonly 
observed. 

Economic mineralization appears to be associated with white saccharoidal quartz, and also with 
finely disseminated to very finely banded black (Ag) sulphide. In some very high-grade drill 
intercepts at the Adit Zone "ginguro" type mineralization has been observed in quartz veins, 
consisting of millimeter-sized patches of fine black (Ag) sulphide together with fine blebs of 
native gold (drill hole 08COM008). Wire silver has been observed locally in vugs (drill hole 
08COM028). 

Drill data suggests that structural control of economic grade mineralization is rather poor. While 
economic grade mineralization is nearly always constrained to within the limits of a given vein 
zone, there is a strong tendency for it to migrate between the footwall to the hangingwall 
contacts over relatively short distances both laterally and vertically, and may also be present in 
minor splays.   

High Au relative to Ag (Ag:Au 6.7 to 20:1), very low sulphide abundance, the occurrence of 
magnetite, pyrite and pyrrhotite, and general lack of base metal sulphides observed in the 
underground workings, all suggest the El Compas is most closely affiliated with a low 
sulphidation style epithermal system. The analysis of drill data from deeper in the system 
indicates that the Ag:Au ratio generally increases with depth, and that the average for all 
mineralized drill intercepts is about 40:1.  Table 7.4.1 summarizes the change in the ratio as a 
function of depth for mineralized drill intercepts in the two resource areas.

Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

8.1 Exploration by MHM 

At the El Compas vein system, MHM conducted 1:1000 scale surface mapping, and collected 60 
surface and 469 underground channel samples for analysis. Twenty HQ and NQ diamond core 
holes totaling 5,788m tested the El Compas vein structure over nearly 1,000m of horizontal 
strike length on 25 to 50m spaced EW section lines in the mine area, and about 100m spaced 
lines south of the mine, to depths of 60 to 400m below surface. Assay results from the MHM 
drill program at El Compas were utilized in the 2008 resource estimation. Drillhole locations are 
shown in Figure 7-1, and drilling results are summarized in Table 8.1.1. Significant results 
include 55.87 g/t Au and 368 g/t Ag over 2.50m (not true width) from drill hole HOC-16, from 
beneath the El Compas ramp.  

In September 2008, the company acquired additional MHM data following the signing of the 
exploration with option-to-purchase agreement with Exploraciones de Altiplano.  The data 
package contained information related to MHM's property-wide exploration program, which 
included two holes drilled at the El Orito vein; however, this fact was not recognized until 
recently, as the vein is referred to as the "Blanquillal" vein in MHM reports. These holes have 
been incorporated in the 2010 updated geological model and resource estimate. Both MHM holes 
(HOB-1 and HOB-2) were drilled below the historic El Orito shaft; HOB-1 intersected the El 
Orito vein approximately 125m below surface and is weakly mineralized with 1.24g/t Au and 
13.8g/t over 1.55m, and HOB-2 intersected the vein it approximately 190m below surface with 
only very weakly anomalous in Au and Ag.

workings. A second priority has been to evaluate other veins on the property where potential 
exists to discover additional resources.  

8.2.1 Early Exploration 

Oro personnel first visited the El Compas property in September of 2006. Between September 
and October of 2006, Charles Tarnocai and Ms. Anna Fonseca conducted a preliminary field 
evaluation of the El Compas concession that included surface mapping, and select surface and 
underground sampling. Mr. Tarnocai was again in the field in February, 2007. Results of the 
underground sampling confirmed historical production grades reported by Contracuna.  

Based upon the positive results of preliminary investigations, a more comprehensive exploration 
program was undertaken. Detailed surface mapping and surface and underground sampling took 
place from March through mid-June, 2007, concurrent with negotiations for the El Compas claim 
mining and concession rights.  A total of 25 surface and 22 select underground samples were 
collected. The underground samples evaluated the relationship between grade and different vein 
types exposed in the ramp. Results indicated that both north and northwest components of the El 
Compas vein system carry precious metal mineralization.  

By the end of May 2007, 370 channel samples, all 1m in length were collected from46 sample 
lines spaced approximately 25m apart along the El Compas mine ramp had been collected and 
were submitted for analysis. The results of the channel sample program are summarized in Table 
8.2.1.1. The average true width of the vein was determined to be 8m.

El Compas Property   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 
 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  January 30, 2011 
El_Compas_NI 43-101 TR_343200.010_013_MLM   

In September 2007, the Company filed an NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report on the El 
Compas property (Thiboutot and Tarnocai, 2007).  

Starting in October 2007, historic MHM core acquired from the owner of the El Compas 
concession as part of the option agreement was re-logged for lithology, alteration, 
mineralization, and vein percent. As a validation check of historical assays, approximately 10% 
of the 825 samples originally prepared and submitted by MHM for analysis were re-sampled by 
Oro.  Eighty quarter core samples were prepared from remaining half core using a diamond core 
saw and submitted for analysis. An additional 1,025 half core samples were prepared by Oro 
from previously non-sampled intervals of MHM drill core and also submitted for analysis.  

During late 2007, the results of Oro's work, in conjunction with available historical data, were 
used to define and prioritize drill targets for a 5,000m diamond drill program. The overall 
objectives of the program were the delineation of the El Compas Adit and Shaft zone ore chutes 
to greater depth, and the evaluation of parallel structures. An additional objective was the 
discovery of new, and potentially economic, mineralized ore chutes, and a preliminary 
evaluation of their size. 

8.2.2 Phase 1 Exploration 

From November 2007 to April 2008, the Company completed a Phase 1 diamond drill program 
consisting of 5,399m of HQ diameter core in 37 surface exploration holes, over portions of the El 
Compas and El Orito vein systems.  A total of 1,498 core samples were prepared and submitted 
for analysis. The maximum hole depth was 247m, and the average hole depth was 146m.  

All aspects of exploration work were supervised at site on a day-to-day basis by Oro's Chief 
Geologist, Charles Tarnocai from September 2006 through June 2007, and by Senior Project 
Manager Eric Grill from September 2007 through August 2008. Both persons reported to Hervé 
Thiboutot,'s Vice President of Exploration. Mr. Thiboutot made regular monthly visits to the 
project during the entire exploration period. 

Results of the Oro Phase 1 drill program confirmed the results obtained by MHM in 2005, 
expanded the areas of known mineralization, and suggested that mineralization was still open in 
several directions. Furthermore, the widths and grades of the mineralized veins demonstrated the 
potential for mining at El Compas. 

Drilling at 50 to 100m centers established the down-dip extent of the El Compas Adit zone chute 
for as much as 100m below deepest historical workings, and horizontally on strike for over 
200m, while wide spaced drilling tested the cross-strike potential of the El Compas vein system, 
and evaluated the potential for additional chutes on strike to the north and south of the Adit zone. 
Wide-spaced drilling completed at the El Orito vein confirmed the potential of the vein in the 
area of historical workings to at least 100m down dip and 200m along strike. 

A detailed survey of the underground openings and channel sample locations was completed by 
MGTZ in May 2008. The underground survey data was utilized to construct a three dimensional 
void model for resource modeling purposes. 

Based on the results of the Phase 1 drilling by Oro in 2007-08 and on historic drilling completed 
at by Minera Hochschild in 2005, Oro produced an NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for 
the El Compas and El Orito veins. A total of 48 drill holes were utilized for the estimation of the 
mineral resources; 32 holes were drilled by Oro, and 16 holes by MHM. In October 2008 the 
Company filed an updated technical report for the El Compas property for NI 43-101 purposes

(Jutras, Grill, Thiboutot, and De L'Etoile, 2008). Estimates for inferred and indicated resources 
using gold-equivalent cut-offs of 3.0g/t and 2.0g/t are shown in Table 8.2.2.1.

The El Compas and El Orito veins contain 86% and 14% respectively, of the gold-equivalent 
inferred resource ounces, while the El Compas vein contains 100% of the indicated resource. The 
average true widths are 7.2m for the El Compas vein and 3.3m for the El Orito vein. 

The sample intervals were composited to 1-metre lengths. Grades were capped at 25.0 g/t for 
gold and 300.0 g/t for silver. Gold and silver grades were interpolated into a 1 X 5 X 1 meter (X, 
Y, Z) block model using ordinary kriging. A search ellipsoid with variable azimuth and dip 
angles was used in the grade estimation process to better characterize the grade distribution 
within the mineralized veins. 

The technical report concluded that both the grades and true widths of the mineralized veins 
demonstrate the potential for mining at El Compas. It also concluded that the resource is still 
open in several directions. The recommended next steps were to complete basic mine design, 
planning and cost estimation in order to generate a preliminary economic assessment with cash 
flow analyses. Additional surface drilling should be also considered to upgrade more of the 
resources from the inferred to the indicated category, and to further evaluate the resource 
potential in directions where mineralization is still open. Finally, additional field work followed 
by drilling should be considered on adjacent concessions recently acquired by the company, 
where encouraging drilling results have been reported by previous explorers.  

8.2.3 Phase 2 Exploration 

Phase 2 exploration by Oro took place between June 2009 and September 2010, during which 
time Oro completed 5,912m of combined diamond core and reverse circulation drilling in 39. 
During the same period, it also completed an extensive property-wide surface exploration 
program. The objectives of the Phase 2 drilling were to expand the El Compas and El Orito 
resources where they were still open, upgrade inferred resources to the indicated category by 
infill drilling, confirm the continuity of grade and thickness in areas of higher grade 
mineralization with close spaced drilling, and finally, to test the El Compas and other veins for 
higher grade gold and silver mineralization at significantly deeper levels than in the past.  

All aspects of exploration work were supervised at site on a day-to-day basis by Oro's Chief 
Geologist Eric Grill from June 2008 through Nov 2010, who reported to Darren Bahrey, Oro's 
President.  

In July 2009 the company initiated a surface exploration program in the vicinity of the historical 
mine workings. Ana Fonseca, P.Geo, and consultant to Oro, collected 85 reconnaissance rock

samples from surface outcrops over a 1km by 1.5km area in the vicinity of historic mine 
workings and from  underground exposures for analysis by infrared spectroscopy analysis. The 
resulting spectral mineral assemblage showed a distinct mineral zonation that included 
buddingtonite with respect to north and northwest trending veins within the survey area, and as 
such could be used to vector towards mineralized centers. Additional sampling was 
recommended to identify possible alteration centers elsewhere on the property.  

In October 2009, Oro contracted Ward Kilby of Cal Data Limited, to acquire and analyze 
ASTER muti-spectral imagery covering the El Compas property. Some of the multi and hyper 
spectral image analysis techniques  identified large clay-rich zones within the property that could 
be related to a hydrothermal alteration event. 

During October-November 2009, Oro contracted Geofisica TMC to carry out ground 
geophysical IP and magnetometer orientation surveys in the vicinity of the historic mine 
workings. Magnetometer survey lines were oriented east-west, spaced 100m apart, and covered 
the main mineralized portions of the El Compas and El Orito veins. Two, wide-spaced 
magnetometer lines were also oriented northeast to test the northwest trending Escuadra fault. 
The IP survey consisted of one east-west oriented line and two northeast oriented lines. The 
results of the surveys were mixed. The magnetometer survey highlighted the El Compas vein 
above the underground mine workings, but not the El Orito vein. Neither did it respond to the 
Escuadra fault. The IP survey locally produced a strong response over the Escuadra fault but was 
not able to distinguish the El Compas or El Orito veins. 

From February to April 2010, Oro conducted a deep drilling program consisting of RC pre-
collars and HQ/NQ diamond core tails for a combined total of 2,330m in 4 holes. One hole tested 
the El Compas vein more than 200m below the historic workings and 100m below the deepest 
known, well-mineralized intercept. The other two holes, targeted the El Compas and El Compas 
2 veins south of the historic El Compas shaft, at greater than 600m below surface, where they 
were projected to intersect the Escuadra fault, a prominent northwest trending regional structure.  

From April to November the surface exploration program was expanded to cover the entire 
property. Prospecting, geochemical sampling, and collection of outcrop samples for analysis by 
infrared spectroscopy, at regular spaced intervals along northeast oriented lines was completed, 
as was geological mapping at 1:5,000 scale in areas identified by prospecting as interesting and 
1:1,000 scale in selected areas identified as high priority. These property-wide studies were 
concluded towards the end of 2010 and results are still being analyzed and interpreted.  

During August and September 2010, an infill and close spaced diamond core drill program 
totaling 1,093m in 12 holes was completed at the El Compas and El Orito resource areas. At the 
El Compas vein, nine holes (includes two abandoned holes) tested the El Compas vein at 15m 
centers in the area surrounding a higher-grade intercept. At the El Orito vein, three infill drill 
holes were completed in the area surrounding a higher-grade intercept.  

8.3 Surveys and Investigations 

The company contracted GMTZ to complete detailed topographic surveys at 1m contour 
intervals over the El Compas and El Orito veins for the purpose of resource estimation work.

8.4 Interpretation 

The exploration work conducted by MNM and Oro meets current industry standards.  The 
geologic mapping, surface sampling, geophysical surveys and exploration drilling programs are 
all appropriate for the type of mineralization.  The drilling programs are well planned and carried 
out in a prudent and careful manner.  All drill core and RC chip logging and sampling has been 
done by trained and professional personnel.

Portions of Section 9 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

9.1 Drilling by Oro Silver 

A total of 11,311.43m diamond core and RC drilling has been completed to date by Oro at the El 
Compas property. The majority of the El Compas drill holes and all El Orito drill holes were 
drilled from west towards east, normal to the mineralized veins strike and at a high angle to their 
dip.. Drill hole inclination ranged from -45 to -76 degrees. The maximum hole depth for the 
program was 246.55m, and the average was 152.90m. A total of 1,498 core samples were 
prepared and submitted for analysis. The drill intercepts typically do not represent true width of 
the mineralization. 

Drilling was performed by two contractors during Phase 1 and by two different drill contractors 
during Phase 2, and is summarized in Table 9.1.1.

The proposed drill hole azimuth was marked out at the prepared drill site by a surveyor prior to 
arrival of the drill, using wooden stakes to identify the drill collar location, and also the fore-site 
and back-site, corrected for magnetic declination by adding 7.5 degrees. The drill azimuth and 
inclination were again verified during positioning of the drill machine using a hand held 
magnetic compass. 

Down hole survey readings were taken by both drill companies roughly every 50m as the hole 
progressed. Survey results were recorded by the driller on a paper form and given to the 
geologist in charge. Azimuth data recorded by the drillers was uncorrected for magnetic 
declination. 

After completing a hole the collar location was surveyed by MGTZ personnel using a Sokkia 
Total Station surveying tool, and a concrete pad was constructed that surrounded a short section 
of 8 cm plastic pipe positioned at the top of the hole to preserve the azimuth and dip for future 
reference. Drill collar coordinates are provided in Appendix I. 

Drill core was logged at a core logging facility in the field. Phase 1 drill core was logged by Oro 
geologists Nadia Girard and Eric Alarie, and MGTZ geologist Ismael Hernandez Pescador, and 
during Phase 2 by Oro geologist Carolina Mauricio Rodriguez, directly into electronic log sheets

9.1.1 Phase 1 Drilling 

The results of Phase 1 drilling are described in the Technical Report on the El Compas Property, 
dated Oct 31, 2008 (Jutras, Grill, Thiboutot, and De L'Etoile, 2008). 

9.2 Phase 2 Drilling 

Phase 2 drilling by Oro took place in four rounds between June 2009 and September 2010. A 
total of 5,912 m of drilling in 39 diamond core holes was completed. Of these, four deep holes 
were pre-collared with a reverse circulation drilling machine. The main objectives of the Phase 2 
drilling program were to expand the El Compas and El Orito resource areas where they were still 
open, upgrade inferred resources to the indicated category by infill drilling, confirm the 
continuity of grade and thickness in areas of very high grade mineralization with close spaced 
drilling, and finally, test the El Compas and other veins for high grade gold and silver 
mineralization at significantly deeper levels than in the past. A lesser priority was to test new 
near surface targets outside the resource areas. A total of 1,349 drill core samples were prepared 
and submitted for analysis during this period. The location of Phase 2 drill holes are shown in 
Figure 9-2. Composited assay results for Phase 2 drilling are presented in Table 9.2.1. True 
thicknesses have been estimated by either correcting for strike and dip of the vein with regard to 
bearing and inclination of the drill hole or by direct measurement from interpreted drill sections. 

Significant results for Phase 2 drilling at the El Compas Adit zone include 193.40 g/t Au and 
1,243 g/t Ag over 4.60 m (not true width) from drill hole 09COM043, drilled beneath the El 
Compas ramp, and 1.59 g/t Au and 326.6 g/t Ag over 3.10m from drill hole 09COM054, drilled 
150m beneath the El Compas ramp, the deepest hole drilled to date by the Company to have 
intersected higher- grade mineralization. At El Orito significant results include 19.95 g/t Au and 
168.1 g/t Ag over 5.85m from hole 09COM048.  

The drill program was completed successfully. In addition to expanding the limits of 
mineralization in both resource areas, infill drilling down to 35m centers in most areas hosting 
potentially minable mineralization, and completing close spaced drilling in areas (ore chutes) 
hosting higher-grade mineralization, significant advances towards explaining the distribution of 
higher- grade within the El Compas vein were also made.

El Compas Adit Zone Resource Area Drilling 

Phase 2 drilling at the El Compas Adit zone resource area totaled 1,902m in 18 holes, not 
counting any holes related to the deep drilling program. Drilling consisted of step-out, infill, and 
close-spaced drilling, and the emphasis was on developing additional near-surface resources.  

Step-out drilling targeted the down plunge extensions of two potential higher- grade chutes 
within the El Compas vein; one sub-vertical and located at approximately 2,516,000N, and the 
other sub-parallel to the Escuadra fault (south dipping) located at the south end of the mine. 
Step-out drilling also targeted near surface mineralization at the north end of the Adit zone, and 
in the V3 vein in the footwall of the Adit zone. Infill drilling was focused mainly just below the 
historic workings where local gaps occurred in the 2008 drilling. Three more holes tested targets 
along the El Compas vein system, but outside the resource area. Figures 9-3, 9-4, and 9-5 are 
representative east-west oriented cross sections through the Adit Zone resource area showing 
interpreted veins and drill hole grade composites. Figure 9-6 is a long section looking east 
through the El Compas vein resource area showing the location of drill hole pierce points.  

El Orito Resource Area Drilling 

The northerly trending El Orito vein and historic workings are located about 350 m northeast of 
the El Compas mine portal. Drilling at the El Orito vein resource area totaled 1,235m in 10 holes, 
and hole length ranged from 60m to 204m. Seven of the drill holes tested the near surface 
potential of the vein down to 75m below surface, while three evaluated the vein between 75m 
and 125m below surface. Figure 9-8 is a representative cross section at the El Orito resource area

showing interpreted veins and drill hole grade composites. Figure 9-9 is a long section looking 
east through the El Orito vein resource area showing the location of drill hole pierce points. 

The first seven holes were drilled in 2009 and were focused on extending vein mineralization 
south on strike. Previously, this direction had not been explored because Oro had not yet 
acquired the mineral rights. This drilling resulted in a significant increase in the mineralized 
strike length the El Orito vein, from 190m to 350m. Also, the best mineralized interval to date 
was intersected at El Orito during this round of drilling. Significant results include 19.95 g/t Au 
and 168.1 g/t Ag over 5.85m from hole 09COM048. See Figure 9-7 for core photo of hole 
09COM048 vein. In 2010, three infill holes were drilled, which were designed to confirm the 
high grade potential surrounding high grade hole 10COM048. 

Drillhole10COM061 is a shallow infill hole located 35 m north of 09COM048 and up-dip of 
08COM26. Four quartz veins ranging 0.28m to 0.85m in width were intersected between 42m 
and 57m down hole. All veins exhibit well developed banded and bladed textures, with minor 
disseminated black AgS sulfide mineralization. Potential is good but veins are mostly narrow and 
are widely spaced. 

Drillhole 10COM062 is a shallow infill hole located 35 m south of 09COM048. Three quartz 
veins ranging 0.25m to 2.10m in width and a quartz stock work zone were intersected between 
35m and 44m down hole. The two upper veins (includes the 2.10m vein), exhibit well developed 
banded and bladed textures, with minor disseminated black AgS sulfide mineralization. The 
stock work quartz zone is 1.70m wide, is located adjacent and below the second vein, and 
consists of scattered white crystalline veins to 3.0cm in width with local AgS and visible gold 
mineralization. Potential is good for the two upper veins and very good for the quartz stock work 
interval. The third, deeper vein is chalcedonic to amethyst in composition and does not appear to 
have potential.  

Drillhole 10COM063 was drilled down dip of hole 48 and intersected four quartz veins 
measuring 2.10m, 1.40m, 0.65m, and 0.40 in width between distances of 133m and 154m down 
hole. The two uppermost veins exhibit banded and bladed textures with local seams and blebs of 
AgS containing abundant fine disseminations of fine visible gold. The potential for these two 
veins to host high grade gold-silver mineralization is very good. The two other (footwall) veins 
are quartz-calcite and appear to be un-mineralized. This drill hole is one of the deeper holes 
drilled at El Orito hosting abundant AgS and visible gold suggests there is potential for ore shoot 
development at depth in this area.   

Drill Targets Outside the Resource Areas 

Drillhole 09COM055, located approximately 250m north of the El Compas portal, retested the 
historic MHM hole HOC-21 target, which intersected 9.65 g/t Au and 56 g/t Ag over 0.60m, but 
this time targeting it from west side, now that surface permission was obtained. The hole 
intersected only a few narrow (<15cm) quartz veins at the target depth, and was not able to 
confirm the MHM hole. 

Drillhole 09COM056 tested the down dip mineral potential of a quartz vein showing at the south 
end of the El Compas claim in an area, some 300m south of Old El Compas shaft, that had 
previously been inaccessible. The vein lies within the El Compas vein system, strikes north, and 
is hosted in rhyolite at surface. It outcrops nearly continuously for more than 50m, is locally 
finely banded, and ranges from centimeters in width over much of its length but widens to nearly

one meter wide as it approaches the old surface working at its south end. A rock chip sample 
collected perpendicular across the vein exposed in the working assayed 14.67 g/t Au and 6.4 g/t 
Ag over 0.65m. The drillhole tested the down dip projection of the vein approximately 100m 
below surface. The hole intersected a 1.13m quartz-chalcedony vein with banded and bladed 
textures at the target depth, still hosted in the rhyolite, but was only weakly mineralized (0.76 g/t 
Au and 5 g/t Ag). 

One drillhole also tested the EC4 vein target, a narrow, north trending quartz-calcite vein, 
located about 1 km southeast of the main resource area. This hole was drilled to confirm narrow, 
high grade vein mineralization intersected in MHM holes HOC4-2 (9.72 g/t Au and 92.2 g/t Ag 
over 0.75m) and HOC4-4 (15.19 g/t Au and 155.0 g/t Ag over 1.05m. The drill hole targeted the 
midpoint between the two MHM holes and slightly deeper. The hole intersected a ~15 m 
structural zone starting a few meters above the predicted target depth, comprised of alternating 
fault, fracture, and quartz-calcite stockwork vein zones with associated propylitic alteration, 
including a 30cm dense stockwork of qz-cal veins starting at 136.8m, and a 20cm quartz vein 
starting at 141.5m, immediately below a zero recovery fault. Fine disseminated pyrite is 
associated with both of the bigger veins, and also with some, but not all, of the narrow (cm) 
stockwork veining. The hole was un-mineralized. 

Deep Drilling 

From February to April 2010 the Company conducted a round of deep drilling consisting of RC 
pre-collars with HQ/NQ diamond core tails for a combined total of 2,330m in 4 holes (this 
includes one RC pre-collar that had to be abandoned due to severe down hole deviation). 
Drillhole 10COM057 tested the El Compas vein more than 200m below the historic workings 
and 100m below the deepest known ore grade intercept to date (09COM054). The vein was 
intersected at the target depth but was only weakly mineralized. Two more holes, 10COM059 
and 10COM060, targeted the El Compas 2 and El Compas veins respectively, south of the 
historic El Compas shaft, at greater than 600m below surface, where they were projected to 
intersect the Escuadra fault, a prominent northwest trending regional structure. Both holes 
reached their target depths and intersected structural zones containing narrow quartz veins and/or 
quartz vein fragments that may well correlate with the intended target structures. Geochemical 
analysis indicates highly anomalous base metal and silver values. In general the deep drilling 
confirmed the highly continuous nature and predictability of the major north and northwest 
trending veins and structures at El Compas but did not intersect ore grade mineralization. More 
deep drilling may be warranted once high grade mineralization controls are better understood.  

9.3 Results and Discussion 

Oro's Phase 2 drilling program was successfully undertaken. Based on the results of the new drill 
data, the decision was made to prepare an updated resource estimate for the El Compas and El 
Orito veins, with the expectation that the updated estimate would contain more resource, and that 
a higher percentage of the new resource would be in the indicated category, than for the 2008 
estimate. 

Phase 2 drilling took place in four rounds between June 2009 and September 2010. A total of 
5,912 m of drilling in 39 diamond core holes was completed. Drilling mainly evaluated the 
mineral potential of the El Compas Adit and El Orito Resource Areas.

In both areas, drilling helped to expand the resource in several directions, beyond the limits of 
the 2008 resource model. Infill and close spaced drilling resulted in a reduction in the average 
distance between holes within the general resource areas characterized by above average grade. 
Close spaced drilling also helped to better understand the geometry of higher- grade ore chutes 
within both resource areas, which will help with the planning of additional holes designed to test 
these ore chutes down plunge. Overall, the average drill spacing within the above average 
portion of the resource area at the El Compas vein resource area was brought down to between 
35 and 50m, while at El Orito the average drill spacing was reduced to about 50m. Finally, 
limited deep drilling has confirmed the highly continuous nature and predictability of the major 
north and northwest trending veins in the and structures in the mine vicinity at depths greater 
than 600m below surface. While none of the three completed holes intersected significant 
mineralization, they all intersected structures at or proximal to the calculated target depths that 
contained anomalous to weak silver, lead, and zinc values, which suggest a transition to a more 
intermediate sulfidation-style mineralization. Better understanding of the structural and 
mineralogical controls affecting the distribution of -grade at surface and at intermediate depths 
will hopefully lead to a more refined exploration model with which to program additional deep 
drill holes targeting silver-rich veins. 

At the El Compas vein resource area, drilling by Oro intersected the best mineralized drill hole 
ever within the currently defined mineralized zone as well as the deepest ore grade. The 
additional drilling, which included close-spaced drilling at 15m centers, made it possible to 
better delineate the continuity of higher-grade mineralization in and immediately below this area, 
as well as reasonably explain the occurrence of linear trending zones within the plane of the El 
Compas vein with higher-gold and silver; shallow south dipping zones are related to intersecting 
northwest structures such as the Predilecta vein, and very steeply north plunging to nearly 
vertical zones at the north end of the historic underground workings are likely related to more 
vertical dipping structures.   

Some changes occurred in the updated 2010 geologic model. The most significant changes were 
the reinterpretation of faults in the El Compas resource area. Previously, a number of faults that 
were crosscutting the El Compas vein, including the north striking FEV and northwest striking 
MF faults, were interpreted in the geological model to have caused minor offsets to the vein 
where they intersected it. In the new model these offsets have been removed, since new data 
supports the notion that the El Compas veins are essentially unaffected by these faults. 

9.4 Density Determinations 

Two hundred and ninety-six density determinations were made on pieces of half core from 19 
drill holes located internal to the two resource areas. Representative samples of vein, and also of 
footwall and hanging wall host lithology adjacent to the veins, were selected for testing. Density 
was determined by the wet/dry method using an electronic scale. Results are summarized by rock 
type and are shown in Table 9.4.1 below. 

For each determination, a single piece of half core measuring about 10 to 15 cm in length was 
utilized. After first zeroing the electronic scale the sample was placed onto the scale's weighing 
pan and the weight "in air" was recorded. Next, the same sample was suspended beneath the 
scale by a short length of cord in such a manner that it's weight while suspended below the scale 
was the same as when resting on the weighing pan. A basin of water was then raised until the 
suspended sample was underwater and the weight of the sample "in water" recorded, taking care

that the sample has been fully submerged. The density of the cord used to suspend the sample 
was close to the density of water such that any additional displacement caused by the cord in the 
water could be considered insignificant. 

The formula used to compute the Density of the sample was by the wet/dry method where: 

Density = Weight of core in air – Weight of core in water 

Weight of core in water

SHALE 4 2.426 - 2.611 2.536 
SANDSTONE 27 2.496 - 2.716 2.610 

 

A reference weight was used from time to time to check the precision of the scale. 

9.4.1 Interpretation 

SRK is of the opinion that the drilling operations were conducted by professionals, the core was 
handled, logged and sampled in an acceptable manner by professional geologists, and the results 
are suitable for support of a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimation.

10 Sampling Method and Approach 
Portions of Section 10 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

10.1 MHM Sampling 

Sampling methodology and approach were not documented in any MHM reports obtained by 
Oro. Limited information on sampling was inferred by Oro personnel from direct inspection of 
core boxes and their contents, and from assay certificates. Based on the evidence gathered Oro 
believes that MHM core sampling followed a systematic and organized approach. 

The core boxes were clearly identified with hole name, box number, and from-to interval. Drill 
hole depths were recorded on blocks inserted by the drillers every 3.05m or less. Depth 
measurements calculated by MHM tied in well with the driller blocks.  

The start and finish of sample intervals were identified with marks on the inside wall of the 
plastic core box channel using a red marker. The corresponding sample identification numbers 
were written on the plastic channel, at the midway point of the sample interval, also with a red 
marker.  

Core was cut into equal halves with a diamond saw and one half was returned to the core box for 
storage while the other half was submitted for analysis. Sample weights listed on lab assay 
certificates are typically in the 1-3 kg range, and suggest that entire half core was indeed 
submitted for analysis.  

MHM prepared and submitted for analysis a total of 926 core samples from 20 HQ and NQ 
diameter holes. All holes were collared in HQ diameter core; NQ coring was limited to the tail 
portions of the deeper holes. The minimum sample length was 5cm, the maximum sample length 
was 3.05m, and the average sample length was 0.77m. There were only 4 samples under 15cm in 
length and only 8 samples over 2.0m in length.  

It is not known if MHM produced detailed geological logs of the drill holes; the only geologic 
data available was recorded in the drill database and consisted of a single data column 
identifying rock type, together with sample interval and assay results data.  

It is not known whether geotechnical logging such as core recovery or RQD was completed. 
Inspection of drill core in drill boxes, and in particular the mineralized intervals, suggests that 
low core recovery was not a significant concern. 

10.2 Oro Silver Channel Sampling 

A total of 370 channel samples were systematically collected from forty-six sample lines spaced 
approximately 25 m apart along the El Compas mine ramp and submitted for analysis. Channel 
sample assay results were not incorporated into the database utilized in the resource estimate. 

Prior to sampling, an Oro geologist marked out the channels with spray paint on drift back to be 
sampled. Where possible, the channels were oriented perpendicular to the strike of the vein, 
beginning and ending in host rock at least 1m to either side of the vein zone hangingwall and 
footwall contacts. Sample length was normally 1m, but in some instances samples were slightly 
shorter or longer, so that sample breaks coincided with vein zone hangingwall and footwall

contacts. Samples were collected by two technicians using a hammer and chisel, with a plastic 
sheet to catch sample material. Scaffolding was utilized to access backs when necessary. 
Samples were cut, described, and bagged individually. Samples collected each day were 
security-sealed and removed from the mine-site. Sample blanks and Au standards were included 
in every batch of 30 samples. All channel samples were shipped to the Inspectorate sample prep 
facility in Durango, Mexico. This program was co-managed by Rolando Mendoza Pina, a 
Mexican Geolgical Engineer with MGTZ, under the supervision of an Oro geologist. The 
collection of sample material and subsequent surveying of sample locations was performed by 
MGTZ technicians. 

Every effort was made to ensure the sampling was continuous within the channel interval, 
understanding that differences in hardness between geologic material could result in a sample 
bias. Neither Oro nor MGTZ believe a sample bias exists in the El Compas channel sampling. 

10.3 Oro Silver Drill Sampling 

During Phase 1 drilling, Oro Silver collected and submitted for analysis a total of 1,498 core 
samples from 37 HQ diameter holes. The minimum sample length was 3cm, the maximum 
sample length was 3.71m, and the average sample length was 0.99m. There were 4 samples 
under 10cm in length and 3 samples over 2.5m in length. Four Phase l drill holes were sampled 
in their entirety, all others were selectively sampled. Selective sampling was based on the 
prospect for an interval to carry gold or silver mineralization. Priority was therefore given to 
sampling geologic features such as veins, vein stockworks, fault zones, and altered/mineralized 
host rock. As an added precaution samples were normally taken for one meter above and one 
meter below the prospective interval.  

During Phase 2 drilling, Oro collected and submitted for analysis a total of 1,349 core samples 
from 35 HQ diameter holes. The minimum sample length was 17cm, the maximum sample 
length was 2.45m, and the average sample length was 0.99m. There were 10 samples under 
25cm in length and 4 samples over 2.0m in length. All Phase 2 holes were selectively sampled; 
however, additional samples were normally taken for one meter above and one meter below a 
prospective interval. Additional samples were collected if any open ended mineralized intervals 
were discovered upon receipt of assay results. 

A drill core sampling process flow sheet and protocol manual was developed and implemented 
by Oro for the drilling program at El Compas. The relevant parts are summarized below. 

At the drillsite, once the core interval has been drilled, it is placed directly in the core boxes by 
the driller. Every interval drilled, usually every core lift, is marked with a drill-hole depth marker 
using a wooden/plastic block with non-recovered intervals also indicated with wooden/plastic 
blocks. 

The core is collected at each drill site at least twice a day and carefully transported, as to avoid 
mixing up the core or moving the drill-hole depth markers, to the core logging facility using a 
safe and appropriate vehicle.  Before transport, a quick check is performed to ensure the proper 
drill hole number is written on the core boxes and that from-to's are written on the core boxes 
make sense.  Under certain situations, Oro did ask the drillers to transport the core to the core 
logging facility.   

A the core logging facility, the core boxes are stacked by box number in the waiting area. They 
are grouped by drill-hole so a second quick review of number of boxes. The core boxes are

moved, as required, to the core logging benches for geotechnical, geological logging and 
sampling based on priority assigned to the different drill-holes. The core is washed of its 
excessive mud except for the ore zone intervals, which should remain untouched. The project 
geologists, in concert with the logging geologists, are responsible to define priorities for logging. 

The logging protocol and format is provided in a Oro document called "MOS Core Logging 
Manual". The logging system has a principal objective to ensure consistency in data recording 
and aid in future geological modeling. General procedures are summarized as follows: 

The order and name of the core boxes is checked again; the core must be placed in the boxes 
beginning at the upper left and ending at the lower right when the depth/drill-hole mark is to the 
left of the logger facing the core boxes, the core is not snaked back and forth. The core runs are 
checked for omission and/or errors. The core is lined-up within individual core boxes and 
between core boxes. The geologist does a walk-through to determine which sections need to be 
cleaned, which sections need to be geo-technically surveyed, and to determine major breaks of 
geotechnical & geological units. Prior to core logging, if applicable, the geologist or the 
technician complete the geotechnical logging of RQD and recovery. If geo-technical logging is 
done by a technician, the geologists can, at the same time, initiate the geological logging. The 
core is logged for lithology, structure, alteration and mineralization. Geological information is 
usually marked on the core using yellow wax markers; structural information can be marked on 
the core using a blue wax marker; measured depth, if applicable, can be marked with a black wax 
marker.  It is strongly recommended to note important geological characteristics (rock types, 
structures, etc.) directly on the core so the core photos can "speak" for themselves. After the 
geological logging, the geologist assigns the sample interval by marking the core with a red wax 
marker with arrows indicating the start and end of the sample and the sample number mark in the 
middle of the interval; a center line, based on geological characteristics, is traced for 
sampling/cutting. A sample interval is typically 1 m in length, and no shorter than 30cm unless it 
is a vein, in which case the minimum length is 15 cm. Sample breaks should be adjusted to 
accommodate important changes in geology wherever possible. The geologist is responsible to 
fill the proper data in the sample tag books (drill-hole number, box number, from-to, etc.).  The 
from and to for all samples are also marked in red so there is no confusion between these and the 
core run blocks or other information on the core.  This allows for verification by the technician 
before/during sawing. The sample tag books are given to the sampler.  The sampler will verify 
the sample number written on the core and match it against one of the sample tags.  One of the 
small sections of the sample tags (there are three sections for each sample tag) is put in the 
sample bags in which the sample will be put, one is stapled to the core boxes at the beginning of 
the sampled interval while the biggest section of the sample tag is kept for reference. For 
duplicate samples, one of the small section of the tag is put in an empty bag, while the second 
small section of the tag is attached to the sample preceding the duplicate sample. For the blank 
and standard samples one of the small sections of the tag is attached to the bags while the other 
small section of the tag is stapled in the core boxes (sample preceding the standard/blank 
samples). Note that it is always the same side of the cut core that goes in the sampling bags, 
usually the right hand side. The geologists must make sure that the technician understands this 
step. The core boxes then proceed to the photo station where every box is digitally photographed 
twice; first dry and then wet. 

The core sampling protocol and format is provided in a Oro Silver document called "MOS 
QA/QC and Assaying Procedures". General procedures are summarized as follows: 



Oro Mining Ltd.  10-4

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  January 30, 2011 
El_Compas_NI 43-101 TR_343200.010_013_MLM   

Sample numbers are assigned for each interval to be sampled by the geologists, who will also 
control insertion of sample numbers for QA/QC samples: one standard, 1 blank, and one 
duplicate for every batch of 30 samples.  The QA/QC samples will be marked ahead of time in 
the sample book using the stamps provided. The "from" and "to" for each interval must be 
checked by the technicians. The sample numbers will be entered in the computer files on a daily 
basis. As an extra QA/QC procedure sample bags are prepared with the sample number marked 
on the outside of the bag. 

All surface core is sawed in half using the centerline identified by the core logging geologists. 
The section being bagged for assaying is always the right hand side of the sawed core sample. 
All samples to be shipped out are weighed and entered in the computer file. If necessary the 
samples are double bagged and the external bag is closed using a security tie-wrap. 
Approximately 25-30 kg of individual samples are put in burlap bags for shipping, the burlap 
bags are also closed using a safety tie-wrap. 

Once approximately 100 samples are ready for shipping a shipment form is completed. The 
forms will include information such as sample numbers, type of samples, and most importantly a 
shipment tracking number. All drill core was shipped to the Inspectorate sample prep facility in 
Durango, Mexico. 

10.4 Factors Impacting Accuracy of Results 

The drilling and sampling program were conducted by professional drillers and geologists who 
undoubtedly, performed to the standards of the mining industry.  The sample recovery as 
recorded on the drill logs, shows that nearly all of the mineralized intervals produce very good 
recovery.  All of the potentially mineralized material is tested as well as buffer zones to each 
side.  Such thorough sampling ensures that both mineralized and un-mineralized material is 
adequately characterized.  Based on the good recovery, proper chain of custody, and thorough 
sampling methods, the factors impacting accuracy of results are very positive. 

10.5 Sample Quality 

The drilling, logging and sampling procedures described above combined with good recovery 
ensure that sample quality of the drilling is very good.  The sample length is appropriate to 
accurately characterize the mineralization and to distinguish any zones internal to the 
mineralization, which may have anomalously high or low-grades.   

10.6 Sample Parameters 

A sample interval is typically 1 m in length, and no shorter than 30cm unless it is a vein, in 
which case the minimum length is 15 cm. Sample breaks should be adjusted to accommodate 
important changes in geology wherever possible. 

10.7 Relevant Samples 

The relevant samples are the mineralized intervals of the drillholes.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
Portions of Section 11 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

11.1 Sample Preparation and Analysis by MHM  

Drill core samples were submitted to ALS Chemex in Guadalajara, Mexico for preparation, and 
then to Vancouver, Canada for ICP analysis using an Au+41 element package. Samples were 
fine crushed to 70% passing a 2 mm screen. A 1,000 gram split of the undersize fraction was 
pulverized to 85% passing 75 micron mesh using a ring and puck pulverizer, from which a 30 
gram split was obtained with a riffle splitter for analysis. Gold was analyzed by fire assay with 
an atomic absorption finish. Samples exceeding 10 g/t were re-analyzed with a gravimetric 
finish. Silver was analyzed by the ICP method, but samples exceeding 100 g/t were re-analyzed 
by atomic absorption, following aqua-regia digestion. Mercury was analyzed by cold vapour 
atomic absorption spectroscopy. The remaining elements were analyzed by inductively coupled 
plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy ("ICP-AES"). Copies of assay certificates for MHM drill 
core sample results were reported in an earlier Technical Report on the El Compas Property 
(Tarnocai, C. and Thiboutot, H. 2007), and are not repeated in this report. 

Sample blanks, duplicates, and possibly standards appear to have been inserted by MHM into the 
sample stream, perhaps as many as 2 QA/QC samples for every 5 core samples, based on a 
review of available data. There was no historical documentation available to verify the identity 
of the suspected QA/QC samples, so it was impossible to draw conclusions as to the quality of 
the program. However, samples were analyzed by internationally recognized labs and are 
considered to be of reasonable quality.  

11.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis by Oro  

11.2.1 Drilling Samples 

All Phase 1 and Phase 2 diamond drill core samples were submitted to Inspectorate de Mexico 
S.A de C.V., for preparation in Durango, Mexico. All material was fine crushed to 70% passing a 
2 mm screen, and a 500 gram split of the undersize fraction was pulverized to 85% passing a -
150 mesh using a ring and puck pulverizer. Pulps for assaying were split using a riffle splitter 
and stored in paper envelopes. All pulps were sent to BSI Inspectorate Laboratories in Reno, 
Nevada for analysis, which was conducted on 2 assay ton samples. Analysis of Au was by fire 
assay, with a gravimetric finish on samples exceeding 3 g/t Au. Analysis of Ag was by 3 acid 
digestion and atomic absorption, with a gravimetric finish on samples exceeding 200 g/t Ag. 
Pulp and reject material is retained at Inspectorate's storage facility in Durango.   

11.2.2 Underground Channel Samples 

Underground channel samples collected by the Company in 2007 were submitted to Inspectorate 
de Mexico S.A de C.V., for preparation in Durango, Mexico. All material was fine crushed to 
70% passing a 2 mm screen, and a 500 gram split of the undersize fraction was pulverized to 
85% passing a -150 mesh using a ring and puck pulverizer. Pulps for assaying were split using a 
riffle splitter and stored in paper envelopes. All pulps were sent to BSI Inspectorate Laboratories 
in Reno, Nevada for analysis. Analysis was conducted on 2 assay ton samples. Analysis of Au 
was by fire assay, with a gravimetric finish on samples exceeding 3 g/t Au. Analysis of Ag was

by 3 acid digestion and atomic absorption, with a gravimetric finish on samples exceeding 200 
g/t Ag. Pulp material is stored at the Oro Silver warehouse and reject material is retained at 
Inspectorate's storage facility in Durango. Copies of Assay certificates for Oro Silver 
underground channel sampling results were reported in an earlier Technical Report on the El 
Compas Property (Tarnocai, C. and Thiboutot, H. 2007), and are therefore not included in this 
report. 

The channel sample results were not incorporated into the database used to calculate the 2010 
resource estimate.  

11.3 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

SRK reviewed the QA/QC for data collected between 2007 and 2010.  This is discussed in below 
in Sections 11.3 and 11.4.  

During the Phase 1 and 2 drilling programs approximately 1 in 10 samples was a QA/QC sample 
while during the underground channel sampling program approximately every 14th sample was a 
QA/QC sample.  The data presented below are QA/QC from the Oro Silver drilling programs 
and alternated between a standard, a duplicate and a blank.  

The Company maintains its assay database using Microsoft Access.  SRK reviewed the QA/QC 
data that was extracted from the existing database and graphed by G.N. Lustig Consulting Ltd. 
(G.N. Lustig).   

11.3.1 Standards 

Commercial standards have a performance range that is either specified or direction is provided 
on how to determine a performance range.  Generally, this is approximately ±2 standard 
deviation from the mean for the standard, and the standard is expected to perform within this 
range 95% of the time.  The standard deviation is determined from analyses of the standard from 
a number of laboratories.  For instance, the standards used at El Compas included 120 analyses.  
These standards are determined for a specific analytical technique.  Within-set (samples run in 
sequence on the same day at the same laboratory) demonstrates homogeneity of the standard and 
the laboratories ability to routinely reproduce the analytical method.  Between-set (samples run 
on different days at the same laboratory) considers the same factors as with-in set, but includes 
bias between laboratories and bias in the subsets of samples sent to the participating laboratories 
(Bloom, 2008).   

The two certified standards used at El Compas were purchased from CDN Resource Laboratories 
Inc (CDN Resource), in Delta, British Columbia and were individually packaged in envelopes in 
2 assay ton (60g) quantities.  Although they are commercial standards and not matrix matched, 
they were prepared by CDN Resources from reject ore material from a low sulfidation 
epithermal deposit making them appropriate for use with El Compas.  Recommended values and 
"Between Lab" two standard deviations was determined using Fire Assay with AA or ICP finish 
on 1 assay ton (30g) charges.  This makes the two standards suitable for the analytical technique 
used by the Company.  Neither standard is certified for silver.  The standards with recommended 
values for gold are listed in Table 11.3.1.1.

Table 11.3.1.1:  Recommended Values for CDN Resource Standards 

Standard Project Designation Recommended Value (Au) "Between Lab" Two Standard Deviations 
CDN-GS-P7A Standard1 0.77 g/t ±0.06 g/t 
CDN-GS-5C Standard2 4.74 g/t ±0.28 g/t 

 

There were 49 and 47 analytical results extracted from the database for CDN-GS-P7A and CDN-
GS-5C respectively.  At ± two standard deviations, CDN-GS-P7A had eleven failures out of 49 
analyses or approximately 22%.  Of these 49 failures, eight were low and three were high.  Using 
the same criteria for CDN-GS-5C of a ± two standard deviations performance range, there are six 
gold failures out of 47 analyses of 13%.  For CDN-GS-5C five failures were low and one was 
high. Overall both of the standards are performing low.   

CDN-GS-P7A (all high) and four failures for CDN-GS-5C (two high and two low).  The 
standard data is graphed according to drillhole identification, which although the year is included 
in the drillhole identification may or may not represent a consecutive time sequence.  However, 
analytical results have a greater variation between 09COM038 and 10COM071.  Graphs for gold 
standards with silver results for CDN-GS-P7A and CDN-GS-5C are in Figures 11-1 and 11-2 
respectively.  

11.3.2 Duplicates 

At the Project all duplicate samples are pulp duplicates.  A sample tag for a given duplicate was 
placed in a sample bag and submitted to the preparation laboratory.  From a designated original 
sample, the laboratory prepared a split of the original pulp and assigned it the sample number in 
the empty bag.  SRK does not know if the duplicates were analyzed in sequence with the original 
sample or not.  There were 97 duplicates pairs extracted from the database.   

Pulp duplicates are expected to perform with in ±10% of a x=y (45°) slope.  Duplicates samples 
should not be analyzed in sequence and should represent the full range of analytical results.  At 
El Compas the gold grade averages around 3.65 to 5.82g/t and silver is 42.96 to 60.61g/t.  
However, of the 97 sample pairs four gold pairs are above 0.50g/t and three silver analyses are 
above 40.00g/t.   

Graphs of the El Compas pulp duplicates show good reproducibility with no failures for gold for 
the pairs in the range of the deposit average.  There are failures below 0.30g/t gold, but these are 
approaching the detection limit and outside the range of interest.  Silver has two failures in the 
average range of the deposit and is overall a little more noisy than the gold analyses.  Scatter 
plots of the gold and silver pairs are shown in Figures 11-3 and 11-4 respectively.    

11.3.3 Blanks 

Blank material was created from felsic rhyolitic rock collected from a rock quarry located south 
of the El Compas Mine.  Blank material was not analyzed prior to use as a control sample.  

SRK does not know whether the material was submitted as a coarse preparation blank or a pulp 
blank.  Additionally, SRK does not know the grades of samples preceding the blank sample 
making cross contamination difficult to assess.   

The Company is using 5X the detection limit to determine blank failures, which is a common 
industry practice.  The detection limits is interpreted from the Access database as 0.005g/t gold 



Oro Mining Ltd.  11-4 
El Compas Property   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 
 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  January 30, 2011 
El_Compas_NI 43-101 TR_343200.010_013_MLM   

and 0.01g/t silver.  However, the fee schedule for BSI Inspectorate Laboratories suggests that the 
detection limit for silver is 0.1g/t.  If a blank exceeds 0.025g/t gold or 0.5g/t silver the blank is 
considered a failure.  The Company submitted 111 blank samples for analysis.  There were four 
failures for gold (3.6%), and 11 silver failures (9.9%), which is very good performance.  One 
blank sample failed for gold and silver with 0.402g/t and 6.9g/t respectively.  This is very high 
for a blank failure and suggests cross contamination during sample preparation or a sample mix-
up.  This and all blanks should be investigated to determine the cause of the failure.    

11.4 Interpretation 

Overall, standard CDN-GS-5C performed better than CDN-GS-P7A.  Standard CDN-GS-5C was 
the higher grade standard, had less failures and all failures were less than three standard 
deviations.  Standard CDN-GS-P7A was a lower grade standard outside of the range of grade for 
this deposit and had more failures with more falling outside of three standard deviations.  
Standard CDN-GS-P7A was in the range of analytical results of most of the duplicate samples 
analyzed for this deposit.  Since gold performed well in this range of duplicates, it suggests that 
analysis should return a repeatable result for the low grade standard.  It may be that a different 
low grade standard should be selected or a site specific standard would be more appropriate.  
SRK recommends continuing to monitor the standard performance and replacing the standard if 
necessary.  SRK also recommends the addition of a third, high grade standard to better bracket 
mineralization in the deposit with samples of known grade.   

The pulp duplicates performed as expected for a gold, silver epithermal deposit that may or may 
not have visible gold and silver.  SRK recommends collecting duplicates from all grade ranges in 
the deposit.  The current duplicates due not adequately represent all possible analytical results at 
El Compas.  Higher grade samples may show more variability and suggest a nugget problem in 
the deposit.  SRK also recommends that 5 to 10% of sample be sent to a second laboratory to 
verify the results from BSI Inspectorate Laboratories.  This is an industry best practice.  

Blank samples performed well indicating no or little cross contamination between samples.  
Several failures suggest the possibility of cross contamination or sample mix-ups.  SRK did not 
have access to the preceding samples so is unsure, which is more probable, but a sample mix-up 
is most likely and should be investigated first.  SRK also recommends that if the blank samples 
are pulp blanks that coarse blanks be added to the sample stream to more adequately monitor 
sample preparation.  

During sampling and analysis programs, QA/QC sample results require continuous monitoring to 
identify failures, if any, as quickly as possible, determine the reason for the failure and respond 
appropriately to the failure.  This may be as simple as properly identifying the sample number or 
as complicated as reanalysis of the entire sample job. 

When a QA/QC sample failure is identified, it must be investigated to determine the cause of the 
failure.  Failures can be the result of sample mix-ups, homogeneity differences between sample 
splits, contamination during sample preparation or analytical procedural problems.   

SRK is of the opinion that the frequency of QA/QC samples the Company inserts into the sample 
stream during drilling and sampling programs is appropriate for the type of deposit and analytical 
technique used.  SRK strongly recommends that the failures identified be investigated to 
determine the reason why the failure occurred and action taken to correct the failure in line with

industry best practice.  SRK is also of the opinion that the QA/QC supports the use of the 
database for resource estimation.

Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.  Changes to standardizations, sub-titles, 
and organization have been made to suit the format of this Technical Report.  SRK comments 
and opinions, where present, contain "SRK" in the pertinent sentences and paragraphs, and 
sub-heading titles. 

12.1 Validation of Historic Data 

Data verification procedures of Minera Hochschild are not specified in any reports. 

MHM property data made available to Oro Silver was contained in three printed and bound 
reports and in one digital CD. Relevant data included a summary report on drilling, a drill hole 
summary report, interpreted drill cross sections and long sections, a property geology plan with 
drill hole locations, level plans with geology and channel sample locations, and copies of assay 
certificates for drill core and channel sample results. The CD included drill and channel sample 
databases in excel. The drill database was organized by sample number and included the 
corresponding geologic, sample interval, and assay results data.  

Diamond drill core from the 20 holes drilled by MHM at El Compas was stored at site at the El 
Compas mine. Oro Silver gained full custody of the drill core after the option to purchase 
agreement with the concession owner was signed. 

12.1.1 Drill Collar Locations, Azimuths, and Dips 

Collar data for MHM drill holes was recorded in table format in a summary report on drilling 
(Anonymous, 2005). The collar UTM's were originally recorded in NAD27 and were converted 
by the Company to the WGS84 coordinate system. The collar locations were then checked in the 
field using a hand held GPS and found to coincide, taking into account the relative accuracy of 
the GPS. The MHM drill collars were marked in the field by a 30 cm square concrete base 
surrounding a short section of plastic pipe set in the hole to preserve the azimuth and dip angle. 
In general these were still very well preserved. Only one hole, HOC-21, could not be located in 
the field. The azimuth and dip of the plastic pipe at each collar location was also close to 
recorded measurements. MHM collar coordinates converted to WGS 84 were utilized for early 
planning purposes, but holes were later re-surveyed by MGTZ on behalf of the Company, for 
incorporation into the resource model. Results of the Oro Silver survey compare very well with 
the original MHM survey and are therefore considered to be reliable.  

12.1.2 Digital Drill Database 

In order to validate the MHM digital drill database all data were checked against original data 
sources. Assay results were compared with scanned copies of the assay certificates, and sample 
number, sample interval and geologic code were compared with sample tag number, from-to, and 
geologic information gathered from direct inspection of the core boxes and their contents. During 
the validation process it was discovered that data from most of drill hole 18 was not in the 
database and had to be added manually by Oro Silver geologists. A number of other minor errors 
and inconsistencies were discovered in the MHM database that have also been modified in the 
OSR version used in the resource estimation. Without including the hole 18 missing data about 
6% of the sample intervals had some type of error or omission.

12.1.3 Re-logging of Historic Drill Core 

All 20 MHM drill holes were re-logged for lithology, alteration, mineralization, and vein 
content. This was done to verify and expand on the original MHM work, and also to make 
geologic terminology consistent with Oro Silver logging codes. This work was carried out by a 
contract geologist provided by MGTZ and overseen by a geologist of the Company. 

12.1.4 Check Assaying of Historic Drill Core 

In order to validate the historical drilling results and thereby make them NI 43-101 compliant, 
Oro Silver re-sampled approximately 10% of the 825 intervals originally sampled and submitted 
for analysis by MHM. Oro Silver selected, cut, and bagged 80 samples, consisting of quarter 
core cut from the remaining half core left by MHM, over intervals identical to those of the 
original MHM samples. The samples were selected randomly from 17 of 20 MHM holes and 
included both mineralized and non-mineralized intervals. The samples were submitted to 
Inspectorate Lab for analysis.  

The paired assays were compared with statistical plots. A summary of the results is presented in 
Table 12.1.4.1 below. 

As seen in Table 12.1.4.1, the re-sampled gold assays compare well with the original assays, 
with differences in average grades below a ± 10% range and high coefficients of correlation. 
Although the re-sampled silver average grades show larger differences with the original assays, 
with differences on the margin of acceptability, their coefficients of correlation remain high. 
Thus, overall the original Hochschild drill hole data is considered acceptable for resource 
estimation.

12.1.5 Additional Sampling of Historic Drill Core 

MHM selectively sampled the biggest veins and many zones of narrow stockwork veining went 
un-sampled. A total of 1,025 additional core samples were cut and submitted for analysis by Oro 
Silver from intervals not previously sampled by MHM. The selected samples typically exhibited 
one or more of the following characteristics: stockwork veining, hydrothermal clay alteration,

faulted texture, or was situated adjacent to an historical sample that was mineralized. An Oro 
Silver geologist identified and marked out the sample intervals, and a technician prepared 
samples of half core cut by a diamond saw. The additional sampling by Oro Silver identified a 
number of narrow, weakly mineralized intervals that were missed by MHM sampling. In general; 
however, the Oro Silver results confirmed that the most significant precious metal mineralization 
is associated with quartz-calcite veins hosted within principal vein-bearing structures.    

12.2 Validation of Oro Silver Data 

12.2.1 Drill Core 

A total of 2,646 core samples of Oro Silver and MHM core, and 98 blanks, 98 duplicates, and 98 
standards (48 low grade, 50 medium grade), were submitted to Inspectorate Lab for analysis. On 
average about 1 in every 10 samples submitted for assay during the drilling program was a 
quality control sample. Oro Silver hired an independent laboratory consultant, Chuck Whipple, 
to evaluate the QA/QC sample results. Mr. Whipple looked at the QA/QC sample data 
graphically and statistically and detected certain discrepancies in the sample populations, which 
are described below.  

Analysis of the QA/QC data for the standards indicates the possibility of a low bias (Figures 12-1 
and 12-2). Both standards' means are about 5% lower than their certified gold concentrations, 
and lab results deviate about the means 50-63% more than the recommended values. 

Analysis of the QA/QC data for the blanks indicates quality was fair with a 96% pass rate, but 
two failed blanks failed very badly (150 and 400 ppb Au), as though there were sequence errors 
or the blanks were carrying gold to begin with (Figure 12-3).  Nevertheless, Mr. Whipple 
concluded that sample contamination is probably not a significant issue. 

The duplicate samples are fire assay replicates from the same pulp, so they can only be deemed 
to check fire assay precision, and not the variability of the sample prep process. Two graphs are 
provided: one shows the percent deviation from the mean of each duplicate pair's results (Figure 
12-4), and the other shows how the duplicate results deviate about a 45 degree (parity) line 
(Figure 12-5). It is clear from the first graph that a significant number of data deviate 
significantly from the mean and is cause for concern.  However, it becomes evident from the 
second graph that the problematic assay concentrations are generally below 20 ppb, where 
analytical variability is the greatest. For this reason Mr. Whipple concludes that the problematic 
sample pairs can be ignored but adds that there are likely still some problems with contamination 
in some assays, which usually only shows up in low concentration results. 

To address the sample bias issue Mr. Whipple's recommendation was to re-assay 10% of the 
drill samples using a 1 assay tonne (AT) sample charge. Mr. Whipple's previous experience 
indicates that 2 assay tonne fire assays are often biased low due to additional flux requirements 
and additional fusion time required. In response to these recommendations, Oro Silver re-
analyzed all samples above a 0.40 g/t Au cut-off, a total of 149 samples. Inspectorate Lab in 
Durango, Mexico prepared two sets of pulps (duplicate sets): one set weighed 160 grams, the 
other 80 grams. The two sets of sample pulps were delivered to the Oro Silver office in 
Zacatecas for relabeling to ensure a blind test for the re-analysis. Inspectorate picked up the 
pulps and shipped the heavier set to Inspectorate Reno and the lighter set to Acme Lab in 
Vancouver, Canada. Inspectorate assayed a 1 AT sample of each pulp for Au once by fire assay 
with an AAS finish. If the resulting values were less than 3 g/t, they were re-assayed again by the

same process. If the resulting values were greater than 3 g/t, they were assayed again in 
duplicate, by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. Acme assayed a 1 AT sample of each pulp for 
Au only once by fire assay with an AAS finish. Overlimits greater than 3 g/t were re-assayed 
with a gravimetric finish.  

Assay results were not yet available at the time of submission of this report and therefore cannot 
be commented on at this time. 

12.2.2 Channel Samples 

Approximately 1 in every 14 samples submitted for assaying during the channel sample program 
was a quality control sample. Quality control samples included banks and standards, but not 
duplicates. 

As a validation check by an outside lab, pulp and reject material from 10%, or 37 of the 370 
channel samples analyzed at Inspectorate, were submitted to Acme Analytical Lab in Vancouver, 
Canada for check analysis. Two envelopes containing 500 grams of sample pulp and reject 
material respectively, were prepared for each sample by Inspectorate Lab in Durango, Mexico, 
and shipped to the Oro Silver's Zacatecas office for relabeling with new sample identification 
numbers. The samples were returned to Inspectorate, who shipped them to Acme. Analysis was 
by their Group 6 Precious Metal by fire assay on a two assay ton sample. 

As a further validation check on the quality of the underground channel sample assays results, 56 
sample intervals from 10 of the 46 original channels were re-sampled. Sample material was 
collected from channels measuring approximately 8 cm wide by 3 cm deep, cut with a portable 
diamond rock saw, over distances as close as possible to the original sample interval. Analysis 
was by Inspectorate Lab on 2 assay ton sample charges. Results of the study show that sample 
variability is quite high for a significant number of matched sample pairs, especially when the 
interval is high-grade. However, when the averages for all samples within a given channel are 
computed, and compared, the variability tends to be much lower. This suggests that high grade 
mineralization in some samples is situated at or near a given sample break and that a minor shift 
in the position of the sample break during the re-sampling could result in the high-grade 
mineralization to be included in the adjacent sample interval.  

12.3 Database Validation 

Mr. Jutras independently examined the entire drill hole database in terms of consistency of the 
information provided. Minor discrepancies were identified and corrected. The drill hole database 
was then considered adequate for resource estimation.     

Independent Qualified Person Robert De L'Etoile has also reviewed the Oro Silver database and 
found it to be acceptable 

12.4 SRK Data Verification 

SRK database verification consisted of the following: 

 Field inspection of drilling sites, and confirmation of collar coordinates; 

 Visual inspection of the drill core for comparison of geology, mineralization, and assays; 

 Examination in Oro Mining's Zacatecas office of core logging and sampling protocols 
and the resulting drillhole digital logs;

 Underground inspection of mineralized veins and collection of spot samples to verify 
gold and silver mineralization; 

 Examination of the drillhole database, and confirmation of assays and drill collars, and 
drillhole orientations; and 

 Statistical review of drillhole assay data. 

12.4.1 Field Inspection of the project site 

SRK visited the El Compas and Orito veins in the field on December 15, 2010, and visited vein 
exposures in outcrops, verifying vein quartz zones as represented on maps.  SRK Spot checked 
drillhole collar coordinates with a hand-held GPS unit, and confirmed the X and Y locations for 
three drillhole collars preserved in the field and the mine access portal, to within ±5 to 10m 
accuracy. 

12.4.2 Visual Inspection of drill core and comparison to drillhole logs 

SRK examined drill core for select drillholes stored at the offices of Oro Mining.  The holes 
examined are listed in Table 12.5.2.1 below: 

Table 12.5.2.1: Select Core Intervals Visually Examined (SRK, December 2010) 

Drillhole From (m) To (m)

08COM009 120.3 127.2 
08COM008 84.5 96.6

10COM071 58.0 78.5 
10COM072 76.9 84.0 
10COM065 81.1 93.4 

Core intervals visually inspected are half-core intervals which have been saw cut for assay. The 
core was examined for lithology, vein presence, and evidence of mineralization; in comparison 
to assayed for those intervals and the digital drillhole logs. 

In general, the following observations were made: 

 Gold and silver grades generally correlate with quartz veining in the host rock (typically 
andesite); 

 Higher grades of Au and Ag correlate with typically darker colored (often greenish-
brown) banded quartz veining, and often with dark bands of very finely disseminated 
sulfides (possibly Argentite) 

 Very high grades (+10 g/t Au and +200 g/t Ag) correlate with banded quartz veins that 
have masses of black sulfides (argentite), visible gold, ± minor pyrite. 

Veins widths are variable from a few cm to over 5 m.  Quartz vein textures commonly exhibit 
multi-episodic banded silica, crypto-crystalline to drusy quartz, white to greenish brown to dark 
grey colored bands, with visible very fine grained silver sulfides and occasionally visible Au. 
Open space filling of quartz replacing bladed calcite is common, and chalcedonic silica was 
noted in the central (latest episode) of some veins.  Near surface veins exhibit some hematite

alteration (oxidation) of former sulfide-bearing quartz bands. Clays can be present in some vugs 
and vein open spaces.  All the veins are typical low-sulfidation quartz veins. 

Drillhole logs are digital logs in CoreView software, and were examined to verify that assays and 
geology correspond to the core interval examined; no discrepancies were noted. 

12.4.3 Visual examination and select sampling of veins underground 

SRK examined the underground workings from the portal to the 6th level, and verified the 
presence of quartz veins from less than 1.0 m to over 5.0 m in true widths, exhibiting the same 
vein characteristics as noted in core.  SRK collected 4 select grab samples from vein exposures 
on the 6th level to verify gold and silver mineralization; and encountered high-grade gold values 
(1.5 to 12.5 ounces Au per tonne) and similarly high-grade silver values (6 to 23 ounces Ag per 
tonne) (Table 12.5.3.1 below).  It should be noted that visible very-fine-grained black sulfides 
(silver sulfides) were observed in the hand specimen for sample SRK-EC-04; however, no 
visible gold was noted in any of the samples and no silver sulfides (or any other sulfides) were 
noted in the other three samples.  SRK's four select samples are not to be construed as 
representative samples, as they were collected from a known high-grade area specifically to 
verify gold and silver values; and the results confirm high-grade values for both gold and silver.

12.4.4 Database evaluation 

SRK examined the drillhole database with respect to drill collar coordinates and hole orientations 
and verified the assay certificates against the drillhole assays in the database. 

The collar coordinates, azimuth, and dip of 30 core holes were examined from digital drill log 
header information against the drillhole database collar file.  One azimuth and one dip angle 
were found to slightly differ, for a 1.3% error rate of the data checked; an acceptable level of 
error.  Many of the early drillhole logs in Coreview did not have header information recorded on 
the logs, and there is no master paper copy of the drillhole Coreview logs for archive purposes.  
SRK recommends verifying the header information against the drillhole digital database to 
finalize all drillhole logs. In addition, SRK recommends printing of the Geology (summary log 
tab), Geotech, Survey, Sample, Alteration, and Mineralization tabs from Coreview to create a 
master paper archive copy of each of the drillhole logs.   

SRK verified the 2008-2010 digital database as provided by Oro by comparing the original assay 
certificates provided by the assay laboratory with a randomly selected 10% of the database.  The 
error rate was low (0.93%), based on a manual check of 214 assays

12.4.5 Statistical Evaluation 

Statistical plots as cumulative frequency (CF) plots of Au and Ag values are shown in Figures 
12-6 and 12-7, respectively, for original drilling by Hochschild (HOC) versus more recent 
drilling by Oro Silver.  

Gold assays from drilling by Hochschild are biased low with respect to Oro Silver (Oro Mining) 
drill hole assays for gold on a global deposit basis.  Similarly, but with an even greater bias, 
Figure 12-7 shows Hochschild drillhole Ag assays to be significantly biased low with respect to 
Oro Silver drillhole Ag assays.  In both cases the databases were truncated at background 
inflections in the curves; 0.01 ppm Au, and 0.1 ppm Ag, such that low end bias by sample 
location is not a concern. 

The bias differences can perhaps be accounted for in the two drilling campaigns by the 
following: 

 Drilling by Oro Silver has been targeted drilling to further define higher grade zones 
encountered in Hochschild drilling, and thus is biased high by success in drilling 
relatively more mineralized as well as higher grade holes.   

 Assay methods and/or the analytical labs used by Hochschild resulted in relatively less 
accurate (perhaps due to partially digestions) Au and Ag values relative to Oro Silver 
methodologies.  This has been documented with respect to silver assays, as Hochschild 
analyses were done by aqua regia digestion for silver whereas Oro Silver analyses were 
by more complete 3-acid digestion.  Oro Silver's re-assay program (Section 12.1.4) on ¼-
core demonstrated Oro Silver's analytical procedures showed a 12% high bias relative to 
Hochschild for silver.   

SRK concludes that it is difficult to assess whether targeted drilling or analytical procedures are 
the root cause of the high bias of Oro Silver drilling analyses for both gold and silver relative to 
Hochschild drilling, on a global basis. It is important to note that the bias is relative; that is, 
Hochschild drilling assays are biased low, and may be precisely low; however, the accuracy of 
either data set will require additional confirmation through check assays and additional drilling. 

SRK does not consider the relative differences material to resource estimation, as both sets of 
drilling data have had sufficient QA/QC procedures in place to render the data acceptable for use 
in resource estimation. If indeed the Hochschild data are not just relatively low, but precisely low 
due to the analytical techniques used, then the Hochschild data are conservative, and thus so is 
the resource estimate.  

SRK examined the Au and Ag relationship for each of the major drilling campaigns, Hochschild 
(HOC) and Oro Silver (OS); the Au versus Ag scatterplots are shown in Figure 12-8 and 12-9. 

Hochschild drilling Au and Ag values show a very broad pattern on the scatter plot and globally 
have a 0.59 correlation coefficient.  Whereas the scatter plot for Au and Ag pairs in Oro Silver 
drilling show a tighter pattern and pairs have a 0.90 correlation coefficient. 

Figures 12-10 and 12-11 below show the Ag/Au Ratios plotted against depth for each drilling 
campaign.  While Ag/Au ratios vary considerably there is a general tendency for higher Ag/Au 
ratios with increasing depth, which lends support to Oro Mining's postulation of potential 
bonanza grade silver-dominant mineralization at depths below the gold-silver mineralization 
presently defined in the El Compas vein system from surface to approximately 200 m in depth.

14 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Portions of Section 14 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

14.1 Summary of Mineralogical and Metallurgical Investigations 
Undertaken 

A series of mineralogical and metallurgical investigations have been conducted by SGS Mineral 
Services Laboratory in Lakefield Canada (SGS). These have included the following work, which 
is detailed in the below referenced reports; 

Mineralogical investigation focusing on gold deportment. Results reported in "A Deportment 
Study of Gold in High Grade 2 Composite Sample from Mexico" December 2007. 

 Preliminary metallurgical investigations into cyanidation, gravity and flotation including 
the effect of milling, addition of further lixiviants and settling testwork. Results reported 
in "The Recovery of Gold from Ore Samples from Mexico" April 2008. 

 Investigations into precious metal recovery using Ammonium Thiosulphate (ATS) as the 
lixiviant. "An Investigation into Gold and Silver extraction by Ammonium Thiosulphate 
Leaching of Low Grade Composite Samples" November 2009. 

 Investigations into the amenability of two samples (high and low grade) to gold and silver 
recovery by leaching at coarse size using bottle roll and percolated column tests. Results 
reported in "An Investigation into Determination of the Amenability of Two Ore Samples 
to the Cyanide leaching process" July 2010 

A summary of the testwork findings is included in this section of the report.  

The tests were initially focused on the recovery of gold and silver by gravity, cyanidation and 
flotation following milling. Further tests were undertaken to investigate leaching using 
Ammonium Thiosulphate to assess alternative treatment routes to cyanidation. Amenability to 
treatment at coarse sizes by heap leach was investigated in rolling bottle and small scale column 
tests with cyanide. Heap leach was envisaged as a potential method of reducing operating and up 
front capital costs on the project.  

In summary the tests indicated that the material tested is amenable to treatment by milling and 
cyanidation giving recoveries of generally around 93% for gold and 55% for silver at a grind size 
of 80% < 50-70 micron. On the high grade samples higher recoveries were achieved. Flotation 
tests were generally only partially successful.  

Precious metal recoveries using ATS were generally lower than with cyanide although it is 
highlighted that the tests undertaken were indicative and still require further investigation.  

Gold and silver recoveries at coarse sizes (< ½" and < ¼") by cyanidation were generally poor at 
40 – 55% for gold and 15 – 20% for silver. Results varied with sample grade and crush size 
although were inconsistent.

gold indicated that the gold particles ranged in size from 1 μm to 134 μm with an average size of 
19 μm.  

Gold occurred as electrum and native gold with an average gold content of 63.9%. By frequency 
approximately 65.4% of the gold was liberated, 13.5% was attached (to Fe oxides, Ag-S-Se, 
pyrite and non-opaque minerals), and 21.1% was locked (in Fe oxides and other minerals). Based 
on the surface area, the liberated, attached and locked gold grains accounted for 77.9%, 20.9%, 
and 1.3%, respectively. 

Silver minerals in the High Grade 2 Composite occurred mainly as Ag-S-Se, with some native 
silver and Au-Ag alloy. The Ag-S-Se particles ranged in size from 1 to 122 μm with an average 
size of 30 μm, and having Ag content of 74.7% to 81.7%, with an average of 77.8%. By 
frequency, approximately 75.4% of the Ag-S-Se occurred liberated, 9.4% was attached (to 
goethite limonite, gold, and non-opaque minerals), and 15.2% was locked (in iron-oxides and in 
non-opaque minerals). Based on the surface area, the liberated, attached and locked Ag-S-Se 
grains accounted for 86.3%, 10.3%, and 3.4%, respectively.  

Cyanidation tests were conducted on the Mid-High Grade 1 and High Grade 2 Composites to 
evaluate the effects of particle size and leach time on gold and silver extraction. Cyanide leach 
recoveries of approximately 94-98% for Au and 57-58% for Ag (residue 0.5 g/t Au, 47 g/t Ag) 
were attained by leaching the Mid-High Grade 1 Composite at a P80 size of 50 μm for 144 hours. 
The reagent consumption was approximately 0.4 kg/t NaCN and 1.7 kg/t equivalent CaO. 

Gold and silver extractions of approximately 97-98% for Au and 71% for Ag were obtained by 
leaching the High Grade 2 Composite at a P80 size of 51 μm for 144 hours. The reagent 
consumption was approximately 0.45 kg/t NaCN and 1.7 kg/t equivalent CaO. The addition of 
lead nitrate (150 g/t) had very little effect on the cyanidation performance of both composite 
samples evaluated. 

One cyanidation test was conducted on each of the Mid-Low Grade 1 and Mid-High Grade 2 
Composites to confirm gold and silver recovery. The P80 grind sizes were 71 μm for the Mid-
Low Grade 1 Composite and 67 μm for the Mid-High Grade 2 Composite. The gold and silver 
recoveries after 72 hours of leaching were approximately 92% for Au and 52% Ag (residue ~0.4 
g/t Au, ~48 g/t Ag) for the Mid-Low Grade 1 Composite, and 93% for Au and 51% for Ag 
(residue ~0.7 g/t Au and ~49 g/t Ag) for the Mid-High Grade 2 Composite. The 

cyanide consumption was approximately 0.3 kg/t NaCN for both samples. The lime consumption 
(as equivalent CaO) was 1.1 kg/t for the Mid-Low Grade 1 Composite, and was slightly higher at 
1.3 kg/t for the Mid-High Grade 2 Composite. 

Treating the composite samples by gravity separation recovered 9-29% of the gold and 1-8% of 
the silver in the Mozley concentrate. The concentrate grade ranged from approximately 1,500 g/t 
Au to 52,000 g/t Au, and 2,200 g/t Ag to 50,000 g/t Ag. Leaching the gravity tailings at a P80 size 
of approximately 55-60 μm for 72 hours extracted approximately 91-96% of the Au and 50-75% 
of the Ag. The combined gravity cyanidation of gravity tailings gold and silver recoveries were 
92-97% for Au and 50-76% for Ag. 

The possibility of recovering gold and silver from whole ores by flotation was investigated on 
the Low Grade 1, Low Grade 2, Mid-Low Grade 1, Mid-High Grade 1, and High Grade 2 
Composites. The first series of flotation tests was conducted using copper sulphate as an 
activator, and the recoveries were approximately 66-78% for Au and 32-50% for Ag. Replacing

15 Mineral Resources (Item 19) 
Portions of Section 15 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

The mineral resource estimate was prepared by Jeffrey Volk, FAusIMM, CPG, Principal 
Resource Geologist at SRK Denver.  Grade estimations were made using a three-dimensional 
block model constructed using commercial mine planning software (Vulcan® v8.0.3 build 
3536).  The project limits are based on a UTM coordinate system, using a parent block size of 
3m x 3m x 3m, with a sub-cell size of 1m x 1m x 1m.  Gold and silver mineralization at El 
Compas occurs primarily as low sulfidation epithermal veins hosted in in sedimentary and 
volcanic rocks.  The veins are oriented N-NW, and dip moderate to steeply to the west.  All 
drilling was conducted using angle holes, in order to better intercept the zones of mineralization. 

The resource estimate has been generated from composites derived from drillhole sample assay 
results, and is constrained by manually constructed 3-D vein solids constructed by Oro geology 
personnel.  No geologic model was utilized to constrain the resource estimate.  Grade 
interpolation parameters have been defined based largely on the geologic understanding of 
controls on mineralization, drillhole spacing and geostatistical analysis of the data.  The 
resources have been classified by their proximity to the sample locations and number of 
drillholes used to inform the blocks.  SRK finds the resource model and resource classification to 
be acceptable for resource reporting under CIM guidelines. 

15.1 Drillhole Database 

The final El Compas database was received from Oro on November 13, 2010 and comprises data 
from drilling programs conducted by Oro and its predecessor companies as well as Minera 
Hochschild during the period 2005-2010.  This drilling data has been reviewed by SRK and 
approximately 10% of the database was compared to the original assay certificates for the 2008-
2010 drilling campaigns.  This comparison showed a very low error rate, and SRK is of the 
opinion that the data is suitable for use in resource estimation.  SRK was provided with a digital 
database including collar, survey, assay and geologic information for all available drillhole data.  
This database comprises 132 drillholes accounting for 27,116.84m of drilling.  Of this total, 
5,160.22m have non-zero values for gold and silver.  The average non zero assay interval is 
1.00m, with minimum and maximum assay intervals of 0.03 and 9.95m, respectively, for a total 
of 5,153 assay determinations. 

The majority of the holes were directed to the northeast and east, although some of the earlier 
drilling was angled to the west.  All drilling was conducted using HQ and NQ core diameter.  
Down-hole surveying for the Oro angle-drilling programs was conducted using a Reflex EZ-
Shot® survey instrument, with readings conducted on an average of 50m intervals down hole.  
Down-hole survey methodology utilized for the Hochschild drilling programs is not documented, 
however historic drilling invoices show charges for Reflex tests and monthly Reflex survey tool 
rentals.

15.2 Coordinate System 

All drilling data as well as the digital topographic surface and grade wireframes have been 
provided to SRK in a UTM coordinate system (WSG84 Zone 13), and resource modeling and 
grade estimation work has been conducted in this coordinate space.   

15.3 Overburden and Topography Surface 

A wireframe digital terrain model (DTM) surface of topography was provided to SRK by Oro.  
The source of these data is from government maps covering the deposit area, and SRK considers 
these data inaccurate, a fact that was recognized by both MHM and Oro.  Both MHM and Oro 
conducted a resurvey program that tied in drill collars, underground openings, and channel 
sample locations.  A visual comparison between the drillhole collars and the provided resurveyed 
topography shows generally good agreement in most areas, however the resurvey area is limited 
to the immediate area of known mineralization.  SRK recommends that Oro complete an updated 
and expanded survey program to better tie in the topography with surveyed drill collars, as well 
as to allow for a reasonable area peripheral to the deposit for infrastructure planning as the 
project advances.  However, SRK considers that the resurveyed topography over the deposit area 
as provided by Oro is reasonably accurate and appropriate for use in resource estimation.   

Historical underground mining has occurred in the central portion of the Main El Compas vein.  
An underground survey was conducted in 2008, allowing the construction of 3-D solids to be 
used for depletion of the block model.  However, as no detailed historic production records exist 
and there are no surveyed as-builts for any material extracted between the surveyed levels, SRK 
has elected to zero out tonnage and grade in the block model above the elevation of the lowest 
level and between the northernmost and southernmost extent of the underground workings. No 
overburden surface exists, and site inspection revealed that overburden is limited to a maximum 
thickness of a few meters, and several of the veins outcrop at surface. 

15.4 Geology and Vein Modeling 

The database provided also contained detailed lithology, structural and vein thickness and 
compositional information.  Oro geology personnel utilized the vein width information for 
construction of three dimensional vein solids for six drill-identified veins. 

Vein solids were provided to SRK based on cross-sectional interpretation conducted by Oro for 
all six zones, using logged vein widths as a basis.  Areas with zero vein widths were allowed a 
limited minimum thickness, in order to preserve vein continuity for grade estimation.  A plan 
view of the six veins solids is provided in Figure 15-1. 

SRK conducted visual inspection of the provided solids, and finds them to be reasonable for use 
in resource estimation.  SRK recommends that Oro geologists reassess the existing vein solids 
and reconcile in both plan and section for the next phase of resource estimation.  SRK also 
recommends that Oro update a 3-D geologic and structural model developed in 2008 to better 
constrain grade estimation, as well as to allow more flexibility in the assignment of density. 

15.5 Exploratory Data Analysis 

Univariate statistics were carried out on the raw gold and silver data for individual veins, as well 
as data external to the vein wireframes.  It can be observed that on a grade thickness basis, the El 
Compas vein 1 (EC-V1) accounts for the majority of both gold and silver metal in the project

The raw gold and silver assay dataset was inspected for the presence of high-grade outlier values 
that could adversely impact grade estimation.  Subsequent to reviews of the log-probability plots 
for the combined dataset for gold and silver, assay caps were determined and are summarized in 
Table 15.5.3.  All raw data was capped prior to compositing.  The log-probability plots that for 
the basis for capping determinations are provided in Figures 15-2 and 15-3 for gold and silver,

SRK notes that the coefficient of variance of the uncapped data is extremely high and that the 
reduction in contained gold metal on a grade*thickness basis is significant.  In excess of 55% of 
gold metal on a grade*thickness basis is contained within 23 assays, and the grade distribution 
above 25 g/t Au is extremely erratic.  However, the assay cap results in a significant reduction in 
the coefficient of variance, which is the main purpose for capping assays.  The silver assay cap 
results in a less extreme but still significant reduction of metal on a grade*thickness basis.  SRK 
also notes that there are several significant intercepts external to the modeled veins, and 
recommends that these isolated higher grade zones be further drill tested to determine continuity. 

15.6 Compositing 

All raw gold and silver assay data was composited into 1m down-hole lengths.  The composite 
length was chosen to reflect the average raw sample length, given the currently envisioned 
selective underground mining.  Several holes were randomly selected and the composited values 
were manually checked for accuracy, with no errors identified. 

Composites were split at the hanging wall and footwall boundaries of the six 3-D vein solids for 
retrieval during the grade estimation process.   

15.7 Specific Gravity 

A total of 296 density determinations were made by Oro using split core from 19 drill holes 
located within the resource area.  Samples from the hanging wall, vein and footwall were 
determined using the wet immersion method.  The results of this study are provided in Table 
15.7.1.  Given the relatively narrow range between minimum and maximum values on vein 
samples (2.227 to 2.680 t/ m3), SRK assigned a densities to all vein blocks based on the average 
values determined by Oro.  These averages appear reasonable, given the vein composition 
identified within the mineralized zones at El Compas.

progressively increasing search ellipses are pancake or disk shaped, in order to minimize the 
smearing of grade in the Z direction.  Metal grades, average Cartesian distance to composites and 
estimation pass number were stored for each individual search pass.  Blocks and composites 
were matched by zone number in order to ensure that only composites contained within each 
individual zone were permitted for retrieval during the grade estimation process.  Parent cell 
grades were assigned to sub-celled blocks.  Additional nearest neighbor (NN) grade estimates 
were conducted for silver and gold for subsequent model validation work.

15.11 Model Validation 

Various measures have been implemented to validate the resultant resource block model.  These 
measures include the following: 

 Comparison of drillhole composites with resource block grade estimates from all zones 
both visually in plan and section; 

 Statistical comparisons between block and composite data using histogram and 
cumulative distribution analysis; 

 Generation of a comparative nearest neighbor model; and 

 Swath plot analysis (drift analysis) comparing the IDW (to the second power) model with 
the nearest neighbor model. 

15.11.1 Visual Inspection 

Visual comparison between the block grades and the underlying composite grades in plan and 
section show close agreement, which would be expected considering the estimation methodology 
employed.  An example cross section and level plan showing block and composite gold and 
silver grades and for the main El Compas vein are provided in Figures 15-4 through 15-7, 
respectively. 

15.11.2 Block-Composite Statistical Comparison 

SRK also conducted statistical comparisons between the IDW block gold and silver grades 
(Indicated and Inferred material) and the underlying composite grades (Figures 15-8 and 15-9).  
This comparison shows that the model grade distribution is appropriately smoothed when 
compared with the underlying composite distribution, and that the comparison of average grades 
and percentages above incremental cut-offs show close agreement.

15.11.3 Comparison of Interpolation Methods 

For comparative purposes, additional gold and silver grades were estimated using nearest 
neighbor (NN) interpolation methods.  The nearest neighbor model was estimated using the same 
boundary constraints as was applied to the IDW model.  The results of the NN models are 
compared to the IDW model at a zero g/t Au equivalent cut-off grade in Table 15.11.3.1 and 
15.11.3.2.  It can be observed that there is close agreement between average grade and contained 
metal above a zero Au equivalent cutoff.

15.11.4 Swath Plots (Drift Analysis) 

A swath plot is a graphical display of the grade distribution derived from a series of bands, or 
swaths, generated in several directions through the deposit.  Grade variations from the IDW 
model are compared using the swath plot to the distribution derived from the (NN) grade model. 

On a local scale, the NN model does not provide reliable estimations of grade, but on a much 
larger scale it represents an unbiased estimation of the grade distribution based on the underlying 
data.  Therefore, if the IDW model is unbiased, the grade trends may show local fluctuations on a 
swath plot, but the overall trend should be similar to the NN distribution of grade. 

Swath plots have been generated in three orthogonal directions for distribution of gold and silver 
in for all veins combined.  Swath plots for gold and silver along the EW, NS and vertical 
directions are shown in Figures 15-10 through 15-15. 

There is good correspondence between both models in all orthogonal directions.  The degree of 
smoothing in the IDW model is evident in the peaks and valleys shown in the swath plots, 
however, this comparison shows close agreement between the IDW and NN models in terms of 
overall grade distribution as a function of X, Y and Z location.

15.12 Resource Classification 

The mineral resources at the El Compas gold-silver deposit have been classified in accordance 
with the CIM definition for standards for mineral resources and mineral reserves.  The 
classification parameters are defined in relation to the block-composite separation distance and 
are intended to encompass zones of reasonably continuous mineralization.  Due to the lack of, 
historical production data, no blocks have been classified as Measured. 

Indicated Mineral Resources – Blocks in the models which has been estimated using a 
minimum of two drill holes which have a maximum block-composite separation distance of 50m 
x 50m x 0.1 (tetra space) . 

Inferred Mineral Resources – Blocks in the models that do not meet the criteria for Indicated 
resources but are within a maximum block-composite separation distance of 150m x 150m x 0.3 
(tetra space) from one or more drillholes. 

15.13 Mineral Resource Statement 

The mineral resources for the El Compas deposit, located in Zacatecas State, Mexico,  have been 
estimated by SRK at 524kt grading an average of 4.38 g/t gold and 65.53 g/t silver classified as 
Indicated mineral resources with an additional 419 kt grading an average of 3.98 g/t gold and 
47.57 g/t silver classified as Inferred mineral resources.  The resource is stated above 2.0 g/t Au 
equivalent cutoff and contained within potentially economically mineable underground vein 
solids. 

The mineral resources are reported in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators 
(CSA) National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) and have been estimated in conformity with 
generally accepted Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) "Estimation 
of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" guidelines.  Mineral resources are not 
mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  There is no certainty that all 
or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserves.  The resource 
estimate was completed by Jeffrey Volk, CPG, FAusIMM, CPG, a Principal Resource Geologist, 
With SRK.  Mr Volk has 24 years of operational and consulting experience in the minerals 
industry, specifically in mineral resource estimation, production geology, feasibility studies and 
economic evaluations.  Mr. Volk has completed resource modeling, due diligence, acquisition 
and evaluations assignments for precious and base metals, platinum group metals, laterite and 
uranium in Russia and the Former Soviet Union, Australia, Africa, Peru, Philippines, Mexico, 
Chile and North America.  Mr Volk is independent of the issuer and an independent Qualified 
Person, as this term is defined in NI 43-101.  The effective date of this resource estimate is 
December 23, 2010 and is based on data received by SRK in October 2010.  The mineral 
resource statement for the El Compas gold-silver project is presented in Table 15.13.1.

* Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  All figures have been rounded to reflect the 
accuracy of the estimate. 

 

Resources stated above a 2.0 Au equivalent contained within potentially minable vein 
wireframes using a gold:silver ratio of 63:1.  Metallurgical recoveries assumed at 100%. 

Underground cutoff of 2.0 g/t Au equivalent based on a gold price of $1,200/oz. 

Mineral resource tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the 
estimate, and numbers may not add due to rounding. 

The mineral resources are reported at a cut-off grade to reflect the "reasonable prospects" for 
economic extraction.  SRK considers that portions of the El Compas gold-silver deposit are 
amenable to underground extraction, and has not considered open pit mining methods for deeper 
portions of the deposit. 

The reader is cautioned that the results from this pit optimization are used solely for the purpose 
of reporting mineral resources that have "reasonable prospects" for economic extraction by an 
open pit.  After review of several scenarios considering different metal prices, SRK assumed a  
gold price of US$1,200/oz and a gold:silver ratio of 63 to 1.    The US$1,200/oz gold price was 
selected by SRK to represent an "optimistic" expectation reflecting the intent that the resource 
should comprise material that is potentially economically mineable in the future.   

15.14 Mineral Resource Sensitivity 

In order to assess the impact of cut-off grade on contained metal, tonnage and grade were 
reported above a series of gold equivalent cut-offs (Tables 15.13.1 through 15.13.2).  As can be 
observed from these estimates, the resource is relatively insensitive to cut-off grade in the 2.0 to 
2.5 g/t Au equivalent cut-off range, which is likely the cut-off grade range of economic interest.

15.15 Discussion and Conclusions 

The current resource is not completely closed off along strike and down-dip.  Although the El 
Compas main vein is reasonably well drilled in its central area, drill spacing is considerably 
wider in the other vein areas. SRK recommends additional step out drilling to extend the current 
resource base, as well as resource conversion drilling to convert Inferred to Indicated resources. 

Given the complex controls on mineralization, SRK recommends that the 2008 geologic model 
be updated with the 2009-2010 drilling information.  SRK also recommends that the current vein 
wireframes be recompleted and rectified in both plan and section.   

SRK notes that there are significant discrepancies between drill hole collar elevations and the 
regional topographic DTM model based on government mapping.  SRK recommends that Oro 
conduct a resurvey of topography both over the mineralized area and external, to allow for future 
planning of infrastructure.

18 Interpretation and Conclusions (Item 21) 
Portions of Section 18 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

18.1 Exploration 

Veins at El Compas show characteristics typical of low sulphidation state epithermal systems. 
Mining of planar quartz veins at El Compas has occurred along discrete, steeply plunging zones. 
One of these zones was recently exploited by a ramp-in-ore, and another occurs at the inactive El 
Compas shaft. These lenticular zones within the veins represent ore chutes. The chutes appear to 
occur within the northerly trending veins, near their intersection with northwest trending faults 
and fault-veins. Fault-vein intersection zones are mapped on surface as areas of curvilinear 
quartz veins and veinlets, faults, and fault-related cleavage arrays. Veins at El Orito show 
characteristics similar to those at El Compas, although evidence of northwest trending veins were 
is not indicated.  

A Phase l diamond core drilling program consisting of 5,400m in 37 HQ diameter holes 
evaluated the along strike and down dip extent of the El Compas Adit Zone ore chute, and the El 
Orito vein in the vicinity of historical workings, in addition to several other target zones along 
the El Compas vein. At the Adit Zone Phase 1 drilling delineated a steeply north plunging ore 
chute approximately 250m wide by up to 200m down dip from surface that is still partially open 
at depth. At El Orito significant mineralization has outlined a probable ore chute that measures 
130m wide by at least 110m down dip from surface that is open to the south and partly at depth. 
Ore chutes in both areas are comprised of multiple sub-parallel, most likely anastamosing quartz-
calcite veins with individual vein widths up to 12m (less at El Orito). Distribution of economic 
grade precious metal mineralization within the ore chutes is difficult to predict but typically 
occurs in veins at the footwall or hangingwall contacts. 

Phase 2 drilling took place in four rounds between June 2009 and September 2010. A total of 
5,912 m of drilling in 39 diamond core holes was completed. Drilling mainly evaluated the 
mineral potential of the El Compas Adit and El Orito Resource Areas.  

In both areas drilling helped to expand the resource in several directions, beyond the limits of the 
2008 resource model, which resulted in an increase in the total resource. Infill and close spaced 
drilling resulted in a reduction in the average distance between holes within the general resource 
areas characterized by above average grade, which should lead to an increase in the proportion of 
indicated resources over the 2008 model. Close spaced drilling also helped to better understand 
the geometry of high grade ore chutes within both resource areas, which will help with the 
planning of additional holes designed to test these ore chutes down plunge. Overall, the average 
drill spacing within the above average portion of the resource area at the El Compas vein 
resource area was brought down to between 35 and 50 meters, while at El Orito the average drill 
spacing was reduced to about 50 meters. Finally, limited deep drilling has confirmed the highly 
continuous nature and predictability of the major north and northwest trending veins in the and 
structures in the mine vicinity at depths greater than 600m below surface. While none of the 
three completed holes intersected ore grade mineralization, they all intersected significant 
structures at or proximal to the calculated target depths that contained anomalous to weak silver, 
lead, and zinc values, which suggest a transition to a more intermediate sulfidation-style

mineralization. Better understanding of the structural and mineralogical controls affecting the 
distribution of (high-grade) at surface and at intermediate depths will hopefully lead to a more 
refined exploration model with which to program additional deep drill holes targeting silver-rich 
veins. 

At the El Compas vein resource area drilling by the Company intersected the best mineralized 
drill hole ever within the currently defined mineralized zone (09COM043), as well as the deepest 
ore grade interval  (09COM054). The additional drilling, which included close-spaced drilling at 
15m centers in the vicinity of holes 09COM043 and MHM historic hole HOC-16, made it 
possible to better delineate the continuity of high grade mineralization in and immediately below 
this area, as well as reasonably explain the occurrence of linear trending zones within the plane 
of the El Compas vein with high to very high gold and silver grades; shallow south dipping 
zones are related to intersecting northwest structures such as the Predilecta vein, and very steeply 
north plunging to nearly vertical zones at the north end of the historic underground workings are 
likely related to more vertical dipping structures.   

Some changes occurred in the updated 2010 geologic model. The most significant changes were 
the reinterpretation of faults in the El Compas resource area. Previously, a number of faults that 
were crosscutting the El Compas vein, including the north striking FEV and northwest striking 
MF faults, were interpreted in the geological model to have caused minor offsets to the vein 
where they intersected it. In the new model these offsets have been removed, since new data 
supports the notion that the El Compas veins are essentially unaffected by these faults. 

18.2 Mineral Resource 

The El Compas property, which had past production, has been sampled with over 11,000m of 
drilling since 2005. Due to the relatively simple configuration of the veins containing 
mineralization, the current amount of available data is considered sufficient to undertake the 
estimation of a mineral resource. One of the key objectives of the latest Oro Silver drilling 
campaign was to confirm mineralization at depth as well as to confirm and expand mineralized 
areas previously identified by the Hochschild drilling. The re-sampling of approximately 10% of 
Hochschild's drill hole data by Oro Silver has demonstrated that the historic data were adequate 
to be used for mineral resource estimation. 

The statistical analysis of mineralization within the veins revealed that better gold grades are 
mainly located in the northern upper portion of the EC vein with better silver grades located in 
the northern lower portion of the EC vein. The ratio of silver to gold indicates a trend increasing 
at depth in that area. It was also observed that few samples are representative of the higher grade 
portion of the mineralization. 

The mineralization at El Compas is mainly found within the vein units, where gold 
mineralization has a tendency to have better grades on the footwall contact and silver 
mineralization has a tendency to have better grades on both the footwall and hanging wall 
contacts. The relatively narrow shape of the veins also tends to control the main directions of 
continuity, as observed in the variographic analysis.  

The EC and El Orito1 veins contain most of the mineralization at an elevated cut-off. Potential 
for additional mineral resources exist at depth in the northern section of the EC vein and to the 
south of the El Orito 1 vein.

Some of the validation tests were carried out to verify the conditional bias and the smoothing 
level of the estimated resource. In order to reduce the conditional bias, larger blocks are needed 
and a great quantity of samples is required during estimation. In return this will cause a large 
degree of smoothing in the estimates and would not be an adequate representation of the 
recoverable resources. Thus smaller block sizes, indicative of a possible SMU (Selective Mining 
Unit) size, combined with a lower degree of smoothing is the preferred approach, as chosen in 
this study, in providing a more realistic representation of the recoverable mineral resources.  

In the current estimation approach preference was given to the discretization of the veins' shape, 
the configuration of the grade's distribution within the veins, without any global or local bias. 
The higher level of smoothing can be viewed as conservatism built-in the gold and silver grade 
estimates. It is believed that additional drill hole data would tend to reduce the smoothing level 
currently observed. 

The estimation strategy utilized in the generation of the mineral resource estimate is a simple 
approach that follows standard industry practice. The validation of the estimates has shown that 
the resource is unbiased and is therefore considered to be a fair representation of the in-situ 
mineral resource of the areas of interest at El Compas. The utilization of a variable search 
strategy (anisotropy model) for the grade interpolation process has proven to be beneficial in 
providing a more realistic outcome.

19 Recommendations (Items 22) 
Portions of Section 19 reference Oro Silver's Technical Report titled "Technical Report 
(Amended) on the El compass Property, Zacatecas State, Mexico, Mineral Resource 
Estimation", with a report date of October 31, 2008.   

Recommendations are listed in order of priority but are subject to change. 

19.1 Exploration 

A preliminary economic analysis should be undertaken to determine whether the current resource 
model, taken as a base case, meets the minimum requirements for development into a profitable 
mine operation.    

Additional drilling is recommended for the El Compas and El Orito resource areas. At El 
Compas Phase ll drilling should target the down dip extension of the Adit Zone in the central and 
northern portions of the ore chute below the limit of current drilling, where high-grade 
mineralization was intersected and is still open at depth. At El Orito step-out drilling is 
recommended in order to test the strike extension of mineralized veins to the south of current 
drilling and expand resource potential in this direction. Infill drilling at both locations should 
also be considered in order to upgrade more of the current resource estimate from the inferred to 
the indicated category. Finally, if potential for enhanced ore chute development is postulated at 
the intersection of north and northwest trending structures then additional drilling should be 
factored into any proposed drill program. A minimum 12 hole, 2,000 m diamond drill program is 
proposed in order to complete the proposed work.  

Oro Silver has consolidated its land position in the El Orito district and now has mineral title to 
essentially all lands covering the principal structures and historical workings. A detailed 
compilation of historical data is currently underway. The results of the compilation should be 
utilized to define and prioritize target areas for follow up in the field. A phased district-wide 
exploration program that includes geological mapping, geochemical sampling, and up to 1,500 
meters of diamond drilling to confirm historical drilling results and test new targets identified 
during the field study is recommended.  

An option-to-purchase or long term rental agreement should be negotiated as soon as possible 
with the owner of the surface rights to the lands covering the El Compas and El Orito mineral 
resources and access ways, along with sufficient space for envisioned mine infrastructure. At 
present no such agreement exists.  

Regional studies indicate there are a number of pathfinder elements associated with precious 
metal mineralization in the El Orito and surrounding mining districts. A trace element study of El 
Compas drill core should therefore be considered, as the results could help to identify structural 
elements and/or mineralogical associations that are associated with precious metal 
mineralization, which could to help to guide future exploration work, and. If successful at El 
Compas this information could then be utilized as a tool to define new search criteria in the other 
parts of the district.  

A topographic survey should to be completed over the resource area. Although topographic 
expression in this area is relatively subdued the only surface elevation data currently available 
comes from government maps which are known to be very imprecise.

21 Glossary 
21.1 Mineral Resources 

The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified according to the "CIM 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines" (December 2005).  
Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the 
Reserves have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated 
Resources as defined below.   

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized 
organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.   

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade 
or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and 
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on 
limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely 
enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of 
the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade 
continuity. 

21.2 Mineral Reserves 

A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral 
Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors 
that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.  A Mineral 
Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material 
is mined.   

A 'Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility 
Study.  This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical,

economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 
extraction can be justified.   

A 'Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource 
demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate 
information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified. 

21.3 Glossary 

The following general mining terms may be used in this report.

Hydrocyclone: A process whereby material is graded according to size by exploiting centrifugal forces of 

particulate materials.   
Igneous: Primary crystalline rock formed by the solidification of magma.   
Kriging: An interpolation method of assigning values from samples to blocks that minimizes the 

estimation error.   
Level: Horizontal tunnel the primary purpose is the transportation of personnel and materials.

CERTIFICATE OF AUTHOR 

Allan V. Moran 
Principal Geologist 

SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. 

Email: amoran@srk.com 

I, Allan V. Moran, a Registered Geologist and a Certified Professional Geologist, do hereby certify that: 

1. I am currently employed as a consulting geologist to the mining and mineral exploration industry, 
as Principal Geologist with SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc, with an office address of 3275 W. Ina 
Rd., Tucson, Arizona, USA, 85741. 

2. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science Degree in Geological Engineering from the Colorado 
School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, USA; May 1970. 

3. I am a Registered Geologist in the State of Oregon, USA, # G-313, and have been since 1978.  I 
am a Certified Professional Geologist through membership in the American Institute of 
Professional Geologists, CPG - 09565, and have been since 1995. 

4. I have been employed as a geologist in the mining and mineral exploration business, 
continuously, for the past 39 years, since my graduation from university. 

5. I have read the definition of "qualified person" set out in National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-
101") and certify that by reason of my education, affiliation with a professional association (as 
defined in NI 43-101) and past relevant work experience, I fulfill the requirements to be a 
"qualified person" for the purposes of NI 43-101.  The Technical Report is based upon my 
personal review of the information provided by the issuer.  My relevant experience for the 
purpose of the Technical Report is: 

 Vice President and U.S. Exploration Manager for Independence Mining Company, Reno, 
Nevada, 1990-1993; 

 Manager, Exploration North America for Cameco Gold Inc., 1998-2002; 
 Exploration Geologist for Freeport McMoRan Gold, 1980-1990; 
 Experience in the above positions working with and reviewing resource estimation 

methodologies, in concert with resource estimation geologists and engineers. 
 As a consultant, I completed several NI 43-101 Technical reports, 2003-2010. 

6. I am responsible for the SRK input to Section 12 (Data Verification), and was the qualified 
person that conducted the site visit for the technical report titled "NI 43-101 Updated Technical 
Report on Resources, El Compas Property, Mineral Resource Estimation, Zacatecas State, 
Mexico Company" and dated January 30, 2011 ("Technical Report") relating to Oro Mining's El 
compass Project, Zacatecas, Mexico.  I have personally visited the Project in the field on 
December 15 and 16, 2010. 

7. I have not had prior involvement with the property that is the subject of the Technical Report.

8. As of the date of this certificate, to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, the 
Technical Report contains all the scientific and technical information that is required to be 
disclosed to make the Technical Report not misleading. 

9. I am not aware of any material fact or material change with respect to the subject matter of the 
Technical Report that is not reflected in the Technical Report, for which the omission to disclose 
would make the Technical Report misleading. 

10. I am independent of the issuer applying all of the tests in Item 1.4 of National Instrument 43-101. 
11. I have read National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and the Technical Report has been 

prepared in compliance with that instrument and form. 
12. I consent to the filing of the Technical Report with any stock exchange and other regulatory 

authority and any publication by them, including electronic publication in the public company 
files on their websites accessible to the public, of the Technical Report 

 
Report dated this 30th Day of January, 2011.
