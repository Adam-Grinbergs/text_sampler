1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

Location 

The Youga Exploitation Permit is located in southern Burkina Faso approximately 180 
kilometers south of Ouagadougou, the capital city, near border with Ghana.  

Ownership 

The Youga Exploitation Permit which currently covers an area of 29 km2, and was granted to 
Burkina Mining Company S.A. ("BMC") in April 2003. Etruscan Resources Incorporated 
("Etruscan") acquired 90% of BMC through a wholly owned Cayman Islands subsidiary in 2003. 
In 2010 Endeavour Mining Corporation (formerly Endeavour Financial Corporation) completed 
the acquisition of a 100% interest in Etruscan. 

The remaining 10% interest in BMC is held by the government of Burkina Faso. 

Geology 

The Youga Exploitation Permit is underlain by rocks of the Archean-Proterozoic Man Shield 
which forms the southern half of the larger West African Craton. Locally the dominant feature 
on the permit, and the host of the all the current mineral reserves, is the Tarkwaian basin which 
is comprised of a succession of arkosic sandstones with subordinate chloritic-schist. The 
Tarkwaian rocks unconformably overly Upper Birimian Series volcanics, volcaniclastics and 
sediments of the Bole-Navrongo Belt, which extends across north-western Ghana into southern 
Burkina Faso. 

Mineralization 

The Youga gold deposits can be described as epigenetic, mesothermal gold deposits, 
demonstrating a strong structural control with a brittle structural style. Gold mineralization is 
intimately associated with pervasive silicification, quartz veining and sulphidation 
(predominantly pyrite), although sulphide content is extremely low (generally <1%). 

Exploration Concept 

Geochemical data, used in conjunction with the available geophysical surveys and geological 
mapping, has been effective in the delineation of significant gold mineralization targets within 
the project area. This methodology continues to provide drill targets, however, given the 
deposits are clearly structurally controlled, a better understanding of these controls may lead to 
the discovery of additional "blind" deposits. 

Historical and recent exploration has been carried out under the supervision of technically 
qualified personnel applying standard industry approaches and procedures. 

Mineral Resources 

The Youga gold project is an operating mine. The mineral resource models supporting the 
current mineral reserves estimates were most recently updated by RSG Global Consulting Pty 
Ltd. ("RSG") and MDM Engineering Pty Ltd. ("MDM") in 2006 as part of the Youga feasibility 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso

study update prepared for Etruscan by RSG and MDM ("Youga Feasibility Study Update"). The 
mineral resource interpolations were documented in the Youga Feasibility Study Update. Since 
2006 no additional exploration was conducted on the A2 Main, A2 East, A2 West deposits 1, 2 
and 3. Hence the mineral resource estimates prepared in 2006 remain current for these 
deposits and are the ones in use by Endeavour at the Youga Mine. 

Since 2006 four new resource areas, Nanga, Tail, Zergore and A2NE were the focus of drill 
programs and internal resource estimates. These four resource areas have been included in this 
report, although they have not yet been evaluated for mineral reserves. The Nanga and Tail 
resource estimates were reported by Mouton in 2008 as an internal report to Etruscan. 

Gold grade interpolation has been completed using a combination of Multiple Indicator Kriging 
("MIK"), Ordinary Kriging ("OK"), and Inverse Distance ("ID") methods. 

The most recent resource interpolation for Youga was completed by Endeavour effective 31 
December 2010. A summary of the interpolated resources at 0.5 g/t cut-off is provided in Table 
1.1.

Mineral Reserves 

Based on the updated, end of 2010, Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for the various 
mineral deposits at the Youga Gold Mine, the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves for the 
open pit operations as of December 31, 2010 are estimated to be 4,477 k tonnes at a grade of 
2.51 g/t containing 362 k ounces of gold. This includes 112 k tonnes of ROM pad ore stockpile at 
a grade of 1.91g/t au containing 7 k ounces of gold (Table 1.2).

This reserve estimate has been determined and reported in accordance with Canadian National 
Instrument 43-101, "Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects" of December 30, 2005 (the 
Instrument) and based on CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves adopted by the CIM Council on December 11, 2005. 

Development and Operations 

The Youga mine commenced operations in 2008 with open pit mining and CIL processing 
facilities and during the period to end 2010 a total of 193,316 ounces of gold had been 
recovered from the mining and processing of 2,515,203 million tonnes of ore from the A2Main, 
A2West1 and A2East pits. 

The Youga Gold Project involves a conventional open pit, selective mining exploitation method, 
employing a mining contractor - PW Mining International Ltd. 

The Youga processing plant uses the conventional gravity/CIL gold recovery process, and 
consists of a 3 stage crushing operation, ball milling, gravity concentration and cyanidation by 
carbon-in-leach (CIL). Pressure Zadra elution is utilized for recovery of gold from loaded 
carbon; it is designed to process 1 M tonnes per annum of gold ore. 

Conclusions 

The Youga mine has a dedicated Safety, Occupational Health and Environment department 
which operates under the guidance of a set of principles which define the regulatory and 
corporate governance commitments of the Youga mine in respect of the manner in which it 
conducts its business.   

Operations to date have confirmed the mineral resources and mineral reserves as previously 
stated for the Youga Gold Mine. 

The results of this update to the mineral resource and mineral reserve evaluation confirm the 
continued economic viability of exploiting the Youga Gold Deposit.

The 2011 LOM cashflow projections, based on updated operating costs and average spot gold 
price of $US 1200 per ounce, shows a cumulative net cash flow (before income tax and other 
debt services) of $US 132 M. 

Recommendations 

The planned contract mining rates must be maintained. The 2010 performance has been good 
but the mining fleet is relatively old and a plan to upgrade it to guarantee availability is in place 
and needs to be delivered. 

The processing plant mill classification and CIL Leach systems should be further optimized to 
improve stability and operating performance within the overall circuit. 

A follow-up exploration program consisting of several components is recommended on the 
Youga Exploitation Permit.  The main objective is to establish additional mineral reserves for 
the Youga Gold Mine and thereby extend the mine life. The total exploration budget to complete 
all of the required work on the mine permit area is estimated to be US$5,300,000 for 2011.  

This is an annual exploration program and as an operating mine there will be a further phase of 
exploration in the following year based on results from the 2011 program.

The Youga Exploitation Permit covers an area of 29 km2, and was granted to Burkina Mining 
Company S.A. by Decree no.2003-186\PRES\PM\MCE on April 8, 2003 and is valid for 20 years 
with five-year renewal periods.  BMC is held 90% by Cayman Burkina Mines Ltd. and 10% by 
the State of Burkina Faso.  Cayman Burkina Mines Ltd. is in turn held 100% by Endeavour 
Mining Corporation.  In Burkina Faso, exploitation permits encompass the right to enter and use 
the land covered by the exploitation permit and no specific surface rights agreements are 
required.  However, compensation of customary land users has been effected by BMC. 

Initially BMC was subject to a 3 percent royalty on the gold produced but by Amending Decree 
no.2010-819 dated December 31st, 2010, with effect on December 1st, 2010, the royalty has 
been modified as follows: 3 percent if the price of gold is less or equal to US$1,000, 4 percent if 
the price of gold is between US$1,000 and US$1,300 inclusively, and 5 percent if the price of

longitude of the vertices of the individual permits to the Ministry of Mines for approval.  The 
Ministry includes the property coordinates in the granted approval. 

All of the mineral resources and reserves discussed in this report are located within the 
exploitation permit.  The current reported resource and reserve areas are located with the 
relative location of existing mine infrastructure in Figure 4.3.  The open pits, plant location, 
waste dumps, and tailings storage facility are shown in Figures 4.3 and 5.1.

Section 78 of the Mining Code of Burkina Faso provides that a mining permit holder must open 
a trust account at the Central Bank of West African State ("BCEAO") or in a commercial bank in 
Burkina Faso, to deposit funds to implement the environmental preservation and rehabilitation 
program the permit holder has adopted.  The account is in the name of the permit holder but 
the funds are held in trust and all withdrawals are subject to prior approval of the Minister of 
Finance and Economy of Burkina Faso.  BMC has opened such an account and has been funding 
it on a yearly basis in accordance with the legislation.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, is serviced from Europe by Air France (direct flights 
from Paris seven times a week) and Brussels Airlines (direct flights from Brussels two times a 
week).  

The mine offices are 193 kilometres by road or approximately 3.5 hour drive from 
Ouagadougou.  Road access from Ouagadougou is via paved highway N-5 south towards Po for 
70 km, then southeast for 23 km on paved road N-17 reaching Manga and continuing on in the 
same direction on a 76 km long gravel road R-12 to Zabre. Youga is accessed by driving 24 km 
southeast from Zabre on a well-maintained gravel road.  

In addition, the neighbouring countries are accessible via a network of roads as well as by 
regularly scheduled air services.  

A network of well-maintained roads allows vehicle access within the Youga Exploitation Permit 
during the dry season. Portions of the property are not easily accessible during the wet season 
due to the inundation of the roads and a lack of bridges over swollen water courses. 

The topography in the mine area is relatively flat with local low ridges.  Elevation varies from 
200 metres to 250 metres above sea level. 

The local climate is that of the Sahel zone, near the transition from savannah in the south to the 
steppes (desert) in the north. The wet season extends from June to September with peak 
rainfall in August, usually with cloud bursts and thunderstorms that can be severe. The mean 
annual rainfall is between 700 and 1,000 mm. Typical daytime temperatures range from 25 oC 
in December to 45 oC in May, with night-time temperatures dropping by approximately 10 
degrees. Temperatures exceeding 40 oC in the months prior to the wet season are common. 
Mining activities can be continued year round without interruption.  Exploration activities are 
only interrupted during the rainy season in those portions of the property with poorer road 
access. 

The seaport used for shipping heavy equipment and various imported supply to site is the port 
of Tema in Ghana, and from there via road to the Youga site. The roads through Ghana to the 
Burkina Faso border are generally in good repair, and the road inside Burkina Faso from the 
border to site is unpaved, but is in very good condition. 

Burkina Faso's total annual power generation is 700 million kWh (2009), with the majority of 
power being generated and used in the major cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso. There 
is no national grid power in the Youga area; however a 10 MVA power line is now in operation 
supplying grid-power from Ghana. 

Water is supplied to the mine and camp via an 11 km long xx" diameter pipeline from the 
Nakambé River to the northeast of the mine.

The mining industry in Burkina Faso is active and has been expanding as new mines are 
opened.  There are an increasing number of local mining personnel available.  Mine workers 
and professionals are available from neighbouring countries (i.e. Mali and Ghana). 

There is no landline telephone service to the area, but there is adequate (including data 
transmission) cell service in the area of the mine. A Vsat system providing access to internet 
and voice communications has been implemented at the plant and administration site. 

Facilities and infrastructure at the Youga Gold Mine (Figure 5.1) consists of: 
· Two currently operating open pits, two waste rock dumps and a fleet of mobile 

mining equipment; 
· An explosives storage site with magazines, and a fuel storage facility; 
· A 1.0Mt/a gold ore processing plant and associated tailing storage facility; 
· A Maintenance shop and warehouse; 
· An assay laboratory; 
· Two administration buildings; 
· A diesel generating station for back-up site electrical power; 
· An 11 km water pipeline to the plant; 
· A camp complete with kitchen and catering facilities; and 
· Security building and personnel. 

The tailings storage facility ("TSF") is designed for a total of 6.6 years of additional storage.  A 
lift is currently under way and will be adequate until the end of 2012 when another lift will be 
required. 

Vegetation in southern Burkina Faso is dominated by wooded savannah which dries to sandy 
desert in the north of the country. 

The Youga Exploitation Permit lies between the Nazinon River, in the west and the Nakambé 
River in the east, both rivers are perennial. The area is typified by undulating terrain with 
several ranges of moderately sloped hills that rise about 100 m above the surrounding land. 
Unlike most of this part of West Africa, laterite and saprolite are virtually non-existent. 
Outcrops of fresh rock occur throughout the permit area. Drainage is via streams that flow into 
the southerly flowing Nazinon and Nakambé rivers. A small perennial southerly flowing stream 
occurs about 1 km to the north of Youga Village. 

Subsistence level farmers cultivate portions of the Youga area. Crops of maize, millet, sorghum 
and peanuts are grown. Cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and various fowl graze portions of the land. 
The farming is done with only basic hand tools; donkey drawn carts are used to transport 
supplies and produce. Unpopulated areas are mostly forest covered. 

Surface rights are sufficient for all current mining and milling operations and exploration 
activities.

6.0 HISTORY 
 
Incanore Resources was awarded the Youga Exploration Permit in 1991 and optioned the 
property to International Gold Resources Inc. ("IGR") in 1994. In 1995 Echo Bay Mines Limited 
("Echo Bay") entered into an agreement with IGR for a 50% interest in the permit. Ashanti 
Goldfields Company Limited ("Ashanti") purchased IGR in 1999 and the project became a 50/50 
joint venture with Ashanti as the operator.  Ashanti completed a positive feasibility study in 
1999. 

A brief summary of the exploration completed by operators Incanore, IGR and Ashanti/Echo 
Bay is provided as Table 6.1.

In 2003, Etruscan Resources Inc. reached an agreement to acquire the Youga Exploitation 
Permit and three Exploration Permits covering the Youga Belt trend.  Etruscan Resources Inc. 
continued exploration and completed a feasibility study in 2006.  

The most recent mineral resource estimates for A2 Main, A2 East and A2 West 1 deposits were 
completed by RSG Global in January 2005 and two additional deposits (A2 West 2 and A2 West 
3) were estimated in May 2005 (Table 6.2). The resource estimation combined Multiple 
Indicator Kriging ("MIK") and Inverse Distance Squared ("ID2") estimation techniques and was 
reported at a 1.0 g/t cutoff.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
Regional Geology 

Burkina Faso is comprised of two principle geological terranes: the West African craton which 
dominates the central portion of the country and the younger sedimentary cover (Upper 
Proterozoic to recent) along the northern and south-eastern margins.  The Youga Exploitation 
Permit is found on the southern margin of the Archean-Proterozoic Man Shield (also known as 
the Leo shield) which forms the southern half of the larger West African craton (Figure 7.1). The 
Man Shield is further subdivided into the older (Archean) Kenema-Man domain and the 
younger (Birimian) Baoule-Mossi domain (Bessoles, 1977). 

 

 
 

Figure 7.1  
Location of the West African Craton and the Man Shield 

 
Archean and Eburnean terranes are poorly outcropped in southern West Africa and the 
knowledge of their geological evolution is relatively limited. There are several evolution 
scenarios and one of them distinguishes two cycles; an early and a late cycle of sedimentation, 
each followed by an orogenic period of folding and metamorphism ("Eburnean 1" and 
"Eburnean 2") between 2.19 and 2.08 Ga. The initial phase (Eburnean 1) saw the accumulation 
of volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks intruded by early granitoid intrusions. Gold deposits 
formed during this period are typically syngenetic and associated with carbonaceous schists, 
exhalites and stratiform sulphide occurrences, and of the quartz-vein type.

During the later cycle (Eburnean 2), after a brief period of uplift and erosion, intra-montane 
basins were filled with sediments forming the thick series of arenaceous, and to a lesser extent 
argillaceous sediments; the Tarkwaian Series. Economically important conglomerates and 
quartzites, termed the Banket Group, comprise the basal portion of the series.  

The effect of the Eburnean Orogeny on the Birimian Supergroup is best described from studies 
undertaken in Ghana by Blenkinsop et al. (1984), Eisenlohr (1989), and Eisenlohr & Hirdes 
(1992), mainly in Ghana. Here a protracted event initially formed a regionally penetrative S1 
foliation which was followed by formation of high strain shear zones (S2) along basin/belt 
contacts. Stress analysis suggests the direction of maximum compression was sub-horizontal in 
a NW-SE direction and minimum compressive stress was vertical. The metamorphic grade of 
the greenstone belts ranges from lower greenschist to amphibolite facies, depending on the 
distance from the enveloping granitoids. The resulting tight isoclinal folding (foliation 
regionally oriented NNE-SSW) is regionally well developed and resulted in formation of the NE-
SW trending greenstone belts bounded by granite-gneiss terrains (Figure 7.2).

Extensive recent weathering has produced large areas of laterite over the region, which 
effectively masks the underlying geology of these areas.  As a result of the deep weathering, 
outcrop is rare and even when it occurs is often difficult to characterize.

Local Geology 

The Youga permits cover the northeast extension of the Youga greenstone belt (known as the 
Bole-Navrongo belt in Ghana) that trends from Bole, in western Ghana, to Bitou, in Burkina Faso 
for a distance of some 400 kilometers. The greenstone belt is composed of weakly to 
moderately metamorphosed, lower Birimian mafic-volcanic flows, and syn– to post– Birimian 
intermediate to felsic intrusions. The belt is bounded by older Liberian basement rocks 
comprised of high-grade metamorphic assemblages and related intrusives. Northwest trending, 
gabbro dykes cross-cut all lithologies (Figure 7.3).

Property Geology 

The Tarkwaian outlier, which hosts the Youga gold deposits (Figure 7.4), is comprised of a 
succession of arkosic sandstones consisting of quartz and feldspar in roughly equal proportions. 
While the grain size varies from fine silt to coarse sand, the arkoses demonstrate little 
compositional variation. Bands and lamellae of detrital magnetite are evident, particularly at or 
near the lower contact of coarse units; otherwise no distinctive bedding is evident. 

 

 
 

Figure 7.4  
Youga Exploitation Permit Geology. 

 
The variable content of sericite and the presence of chloritic material contribute to the 
distinction between massive and foliated arkose. It is not evident to what extent the sericitic 
material is of sedimentary origin or results from the alteration of feldspar. Generally these 
components occur as distinct sedimentary grains and only in exceptional cases of coarser 
arkose, quartz-feldspar aggregates consist of angular sedimentary pebbles. 

The arkoses are intercalated with thin subordinate chlorite schists. The chlorite schists have 
been identified in mapping by various geologists as volcanic horizons, mafic dykes and as fine-
grained sediments; definitive evidence for the provenance of these units has yet to come to 
light. 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso

Conglomerates occur in very different settings within the arkosic sequences and their 
components have extremely variable size and composition. Boulder supported conglomerate 
sometimes demonstrate impressive clast size, sorting is very poor and isolated pebbles may 
occur in a predominantly arkosic matrix. Pebble composition within boulder conglomerate is 
predominantly if not exclusively granitoid, exceptionally quartzitic. Polymictic conglomerate is 
generally better sorted with clast size not exceeding 5-10 cm and composed of volcanic and 
volcano-sedimentary pebbles and less granitoid pebbles. Polymictic conglomerate pebbles are 
angular and appear stretched. Only in one area of outcrop have pebbles with a gneissose fabric 
been observed. The very rounded shape of granitoid pebbles is most probably related to 
weathering before transport and deposition, and may not imply a long transport distance prior 
to deposition. 

The Zergore sequence is an inlier within the Birimian, located east of the Tarkwaian domain 
(Figure 7.4), and is characterized by rocks that are predominantly pelitic in composition with 
variably sized arenitic and silty intercalations. The sequence is characterized by sedimentary 
structures as slumping and "rip-up" clasts within the matrix-supported conglomerate units. The 
schists are greyish and are altered greenish and reddish, while thicker silty layers are yellowish.  
The Zergore unit may be considered as a faulted segment of the lowermost part of the 
Tarkwaian basin, or may consist of an individual small Tarkwaian basin formed to the east of 
the main basin. 

Most spectacular in the Zergore unit is the widespread development of quartz veins at very 
different scale and the extreme folding with an apparent single axial planar schistosity. Kinking 
is widespread and is at the origin of the complex structural pattern. 

The Youga volcanic sequence is representative of the area south and west of the Tarkwaian 
Basin. It is composed of volcanic rocks and volcano-sediments: andesitic rocks, volcanoclastic 
rocks, volcano-sediments, poorly bedded pelitic sequences, and less common cherty layers. 
Andesitic and volcanoclastic sequences appear inside the arkosic sediments.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The Youga gold deposits can be described as epigenetic, mesothermal gold deposits, 
demonstrating a strong structural control and a brittle structural style. 

Deposits on the exploitation permit are all hosted in Tarkwaian sediments.   The lateritic cover 
is generally thin or not present in much of this area therefore surface mapping or soil 
geochemistry has been very successful identifying mineralization.   

Current exploration program planning is based on testing soil geochemical or airborne 
geophysical anomalies where structural features and favourable host rock types occur.

9.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
To date all outlined mineral reserves occur within the arkosic sequences of the Tarkwaian 
basin. 

Mineralization within the Tarkwaian Basin is almost exclusively associated with brittle 
deformation within the more competent arkosic sequences, with the strongly chloritized 
conglomerates absorbing strain in a more ductile manner. Where the two lithologies are 
intimately intercalated within the A2 East deposit, the arkosic units are strongly mineralized, 
while the adjacent chlorite schists are effectively barren. Exceptions to this are, however, 
reported from portions of the A2 East, A2 West Zone 2 and Zone 3 deposits. 

The arkosic sequences are substantially modified by alteration, principally comprising; 
carbonate, sericite, haematite, chlorite, possibly albite and silica. Pervasive silicification and 
intense haematite developments are intimately associated with zones of quartz stockwork 
veining, intense fracturing, sulphide development and gold mineralization. 

The sulphide content is extremely low (generally <1%), comprised predominately of pyrite 
with trace amounts of chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and galena. Fine euhedral pyrite is 
broadly disseminated throughout the arkosic lithologies, particularly within zones of 
mineralization and intense silicification, where it also selectively replaces the detrital magnetite 
laminae (Figure 9.1).  Pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite and galena are more intimately associated with 
higher-grade mineralization, particularly within zones of more intense quartz veining and 
silicification. 

Within the Youga deposit there are two distinct styles of mineralization; the moderately to 
weakly silicified arkose with quartz stockwork veining and pyrite is the predominant sulphide 
which generally grades between 0.5 and 2 g/t and the intensely silicified arkose with abundant 
quartz veins and more diverse sulphides which generally grades >3g/t (Figures 9.1 & 9.2).

Figure 9.2  
Silicified Arkose 

 
The A2 Main deposit appears to represent a point at which a shear has refracted through a 
more competent arkosic sequence. The style of mineralization is distinctly brittle in character, 
represented by irregular fracturing, quartz veining and occasional brecciation. The intimately 
related A2 East mineralization almost certainly reflects the same structure, but is developed 
within a conformable (070/45oN) setting within thin arkose units sandwiched between more 
ductile chlorite schist (conglomerate) horizons. Dominantly ductile deformation within the 
chlorite schist units has created more brittle fracturing and quartz veining of the adjacent 
arkose.  The smaller A2 West Zone 1 deposit provides a relatively minor volumetric 
contribution to the project, however its economic contribution is more substantial due to a 
higher relative grade and low associated stripping ratio. While the geology and mineralization 
of the A2 West 1 deposit is essentially identical to the A2 Main deposit, the precise structural 
controls on mineralization are yet to be resolved. 

The A2 West Zone 2 and 3 deposits superficially appear to be relatively straight forward.  The 
deposits are aligned along a northeast trending, steeply southeast dipping structure that marks 
the approximate north-western extent of the Tarkwaian inlier. This orientation is also 
consistent with the immediately adjacent north-western margin of the Upper Birimian Bole-
Navrongo Belt at this point. Mineralization associated with the A2 West Zone 2 and Zone 3 
deposits appears to be broadly conformable with both the regional fabric and lithology, 
confined to one or more arkosic units sandwiched between conglomerate lenses (chlorite schist 
units) similar to the A2 East deposit. There is, however, some evidence that the mineralization 
(and therefore possibly structure) mildly transgresses lithology, with sporadic mineralization 
developed within the chlorite schists themselves.  

The Nanga and Tail deposits are a similar style of mineralization to A2 Main and East and 
strongly related to pervasive silicification, quartz veining and pyritization of the arkose host 
rock, although the mineralization is not as strong or as extensive in these deposits. The Nanga 
deposit is a well-defined zone, steeply dipping to the east while the Tail deposit is less well 
constrained, trends east-west and dips shallowly to the north.

The Zergoré deposit represents the most significant soil anomaly on the Youga permit and was 
the focus of the earliest exploration efforts. The mineralization occurs off the eastern flank of 
the Tarkwaian basin and in structurally complex. Gold appears to be hosted within sericitic and 
chloritic schists with only minor intercalations of arkose which are tightly folded along a 
roughly north-south hinge with steeply dipping limbs. Gold mineralization is associated with 
quartz-veining and sulphidation (mainly pyrite) along numerous zones. A2NE mineralization 
also occurs off the Tarkwaian basin, has similar host rocks with similar alteration but is much 
less structurally complex than Zergoré. The A2NE deposit consists of a number of steeply, north 
dipping zones along an east-west trend.  

The known dimensions and orientations of the mineral deposits are described in Table 9.1.

10.0 EXPLORATION 
 
Endeavour's (formerly Etruscan's) evaluation of the Youga project area began in 2003 with the 
purchase of the Youga Project from joint venture partners Ashanti and Echo Bay.  The first drill 
campaign began in November 2003. 

Exploration has been carried out under the supervision of technically qualified personnel 
applying standard industry approaches.  Geochemical data quality has routinely been assessed 
as part of ongoing exploration procedures.  All data acquired meets or exceeds industry 
standards.  All exploration work has been carried out by, or supervised by technical personnel 
of the operator (IGR, Ashanti and Etruscan).  Consultants and contractors have been engaged by 
Endeavour/Etruscan for various activities including; geophysical surveys, structural mapping, 
drilling, and assaying.  Table 10.1 summarizes the contractors and consultants engaged in the 
Endeavour/Etruscan managed programmes of work.

Geochemical data, used in conjunction with the available geophysical survey and geological 
mapping, has been effective in the delineation of significant gold mineralization targets within 
the project area. Whilst the high order geochemical anomalies have been trenched and drilled, 
potential exists to identify additional gold mineralization either proximal to the currently 
defined deposits (i.e.: A2 Main/East and A2 West), by additional drilling of known mineralized 
structures both along strike and down dip/plunge, or by follow up exploration of lower order

geochemical anomalies.  The more rheologically and chemically reactive arkosic Tarkwaian 
stratigraphy is considered a high priority lithological target when combined with structurally 
favourable settings such as those identified for the A2 Main/East deposit. 

Overall the structural controls on the known mineralization are still poorly understood and a 
better understanding of these controls could lead to targeted drilling for "blind" mineralization.

11.0 DRILLING 
 
Summary of Drilling Completed 
 
Rotary-air-blast ("RAB"), RC and diamond drilling were completed during the various 
exploration stages carried out by IGR, Ashanti/Echo Bay, Etruscan and Endeavour. Table 11.1 
outlines the drilling to the end of December 2010 and lists of hole-collars. Significant 
intersections were included in previous resource reports. The RAB drilling has not been utilized 
for the mineral resource estimates.

Table 11.1  
Summary of Drilling Statistics 

 
Drill data collection can be subdivided into two distinct periods of exploration; prior to 2000 
and 2003 onwards (as noted in Table 11.1).  The first period relates to data collected as part of 
Incanore's and IGR's exploration management and programs executed under the management 
of the Echo Bay and Ashanti joint venture.  The second period relates to data collected under 
work programs managed by Endeavour. 

Exploration activities and data collection methodologies applied during the initial period is 
based on information compiled in Ashanti's 1999 databases and discussed in the Ashanti 
feasibility study completed in 1999 (Ashanti Goldfields/Echo Bay Joint Venture, November 1999). 
All previously existing diamond-drill core from resource areas has been reviewed and re-logged 
using Endeavour/Etruscan coding. 

Collar Surveys 

All drill collars completed during the Ashanti/Echo Bay and Endeavour work programs have 
been surveyed using a combination of total-station survey and Differential Global Positioning 
Satellite ("DGPS") techniques and utilized control points. Co-ordinates are recorded in WGS84, 
UTM Zone 29 North. 

Downhole Surveys 

Ashanti/Echo Bay surveyed down-hole deviation using Sperry Sun single shot downhole 
cameras at intervals ranging from 20 to 126 m and corrected for magnetic declination. Drilling 
completed by Endeavour were down-hole surveyed using a Flexit© downhole instrument at a 
minimum of every 30 m and measured relative to magnetic north.

Twin Hole Program 

Etruscan undertook a seven-hole, diamond-drill program during 2004 that twinned RC holes 
from the Ashanti/Echo Bay era. The holes selected for twinning were all from the A2 West 
deposits as there was very little RC drilling completed over the A2 Main and East deposits. The 
results of the program confirmed mineralization intervals and grades. 

Endeavour recently twinned two RC holes from the A2NE deposit, which confirmed 
mineralization intervals and grades. A program is planned for early 2011 to twin RC holes at 
Zergore. 

Drilling Results 

A significant quantity of drilling has been completed and, as such, it is not practical to include a 
listing of all significant drilling intersects.  The A2 Main/East and A2 West deposits have been 
subject to extensive resource studies, as discussed in subsequent sections of this report, and 
therefore no listing of significant intersections is provided. 

A listing of significant mineralised intersections for the A2NE, Zergore, Nanga and Tail deposits, 
which were not the focus of earlier study, is provided as Appendix A. 

Drilling Orientation 

The drilling at Youga has generally been targeted normal to the plane of the principal, 
mineralized orientation ensuring the optimum angle of intersection (Table 11.2). Scissor holes, 
drilled back in the opposite sense, have also been completed on each deposit to ensure the 
proper orientation.

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
Trench Sampling 

The trenching completed at Youga consists of generally manually excavated trenches to 
bedrock, which were generally less than 2 m in depth. Trenches were mapped in detail prior to 
sampling continuous channels at 1 m to 2 m intervals.   

Reverse Circulation Sampling 

Samples were collected over 1 m intervals in a large plastic bag directly from the cyclone. The 
entire sample was split in a three-tier riffle splitter to get down to approximately 2 kg. The 
splitter and boxes were cleaned with compressed air between samples. If the sample was wet, 
the entire sample was placed in a large rice bag and allowed to dry in the sun before the sample 
was split off. 

The geologist records the sample number, total weight of the split sample, if water was present, 
and a number of characteristics of the cuttings on a log sheet. Beside the drill, an A3 size chip-
board was completed by gluing powder and chips from each sample interval.  Alternatively a 
sub-sample of washed chips was placed in partitioned chip trays. 

The approximately 2 kg sub-samples were placed in plastic bags and sealed with a numbered 
sample tag enclosed. A second 2 kg sub-sample was split off and retained, on-site, as a reference 
sample. 

Diamond Drill Sampling 

The core was placed into treated, wooden core-boxes at the drill site by the contract drillers.  
The drillers also placed wooden blocks, indicating the meterage, into the core boxes at the end 
of each run (normally every 3m).   

Following the completion of all geotechnical measurements, core recovery, geological logging 
and photographs the sampling intervals are laid out by the geologist. Typically sampling is 
broken at geological contacts with samples ranging in length from 0.5 to 1.5 meters but where 
possible samples were routinely collected over 1 meter intervals. Care is taken to consistently 
collect assay-samples from one side of the core.  

Each core box was labelled with aluminum Dymo tape indicating the hole number, box number, 
and the hole length at the beginning and end of the core contained within the box.  The labelled 
core boxes were stored under cover in steel racks in the core facility. 

The deposit dimensions listed in Table 9.1 represent the extents of the mineralization and also 
the area that was sampled by a combination of trenching, RC and core drilling to establish the 
mineral resources in each of those deposits.

 34 

Sample Recovery 

The sample recovery of the drilling completed prior to Endeavour involvement is not recorded 
in the database, although Ashanti reported sample recovery for both the RC and diamond 
drilling to be high. 

During drilling that was managed by Endeavour the recovery has been routinely calculated and 
entered into the database, with the average core recovery for the Endeavour diamond-drilling 
being near 95% and RC recoveries estimated near 79%.  Acceptable recovery has been achieved 
for all programmes of drilling completed. 

Sample Quality 

The sampling techniques for both the Ashanti and Endeavour drilling programs are considered, 
by the authors, to be representative and suitable for resource estimation and mine planning 
studies. 

Logging quality for both the Ashanti and Endeavour drilling programs are considered, by the 
authors, to be consistent with industry standards and suitable for resource estimation and mine 
planning studies.

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
Samples were collected in the field (trench, RC) or collected in the core logging area (DDH), 
bagged immediately in plastic-sample bags and stapled shut with a sample tag inside.  Samples 
were stored at the exploration camp until such time as a sufficient number of samples had been 
collected to send to the assay laboratory. Samples were delivered directly to the laboratory by 
Endeavour personnel or received directly by laboratory staff at the exploration camp. 

No aspect of the sample preparation was conducted by an employee, officer, director or 
associate of Endeavour.   

Ashanti utilized Inchcape Testing Services ("ITS") Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso as the primary 
assay facility for processing samples.  In addition, the SGS facility at Tarkwa in Ghana was also 
utilized for assaying of selected diamond core and trench samples. Sample preparation was 
completed on the entire submitted sample, including crushing and pulverization to a targeted 
95% passing 75 μm.  A 50 g sub-sample was analyzed by fire assay ("FA") with an atomic 
absorption spectroscopy ("AAS") finish.  The lower detection limit was stated as 0.005 ppm Au. 

Originally Endeavour utilized SGS Tarkwa to complete sample preparation and FA analyses on 
all RC and core sampling as above, but with a reported lower detection limit of 0.01 ppm Au. 
Abilab/ALS Ouagadougou was also used periodically for some earlier stage drill programs, with 
a reported lower detection limit of 0.01 ppm Au. Recent sample preparation and analyses have 
been completed by the SGS laboratory in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. 

Endeavour consistently employed a rigorous quality control and assurance ("QAQC") program 
comprising regular insertion of field duplicates, blanks and a suite of commercial reference 
samples. QAQC results were monitored on a batch by batch basis and any batch with more than 
two sample failures was re-assayed. 

Umpire assaying was completed by Lakefield Canada (Toronto) was a combination of 50 g FA 
with ICP-OES finish, and a gravimetric fire assay check of assays above 2 g/t Au. Correlation 
with the initial results was very high. 

The authors believe current sampling methods, sample preparation procedures, analytical 
techniques and sample security measures are considered appropriate and sufficient to meet 
current accepted industry standards. 

ITS, SGS, Abilab/ALS, Lakefield are all certified and internationally recognized laboratories.  The 
local laboratories are operated as subsidiaries of the parent company and are subject to 
internal quality control programs and protocols in accordance with the operating practices of 
the parent laboratory. 

Bulk Density 

Bulk density determinations have been carried out by both Ashanti and Endeavour 
(Table 13.1).  Samples were collected from hanging-wall, footwall and mineralized horizons and 
more than 10m below the surface (predominantly in un-weathered rock).

Bulk Density Determination Sampling by Domain 

 
The Ashanti bulk density ("SG") determinations (described as specific gravity) were reportedly 
undertaken by SGS in Ghana applying the 'Archimedes' method (water displacement).  The SG 
determinations conducted by Ashanti were completed on samples of one half-split drill core 
submitted to SGS Laboratories (Ghana) for gold assay.  Two determinations were made and 
averaged for each sample.  The SG determinations were made prior to crushing the samples. 

The Etruscan bulk density determinations were completed by SGS in Tarkwa using billets of 
half-core selected from reference material at Youga.  The SGS determination methodology 
included weighing the core in air as received, before drying billets for 6 hours at 100ºC to 
150ºC, weighing the samples dry to record the moisture content, coating the samples in 
paraffin, weighing again to determine the weight of paraffin, weighing in water, then 
determining the bulk density, having allowed for the density of the paraffin.   

Recent bulk density determinations for Endeavour were completed by SGS Ouagadougou, 
Burkina Faso. The only difference in the determination technique from that described above 
was the use of hairspray to seal samples, instead of wax. 

The SGS methodology represents an industry standard approach with a high level of 
consistency noted within and between the Ashanti or Endeavour datasets.  Bulk density 
determinations have been conducted in accordance with industry standard procedures. 

The authors believe the bulk density determination methods are appropriate and sufficient to 
meet current accepted industry standards.

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
A number of quality assurance and quality control procedures were rigorously implemented to 
monitor the accuracy and precision of the analytical and assay data received from all 
laboratories during the exploration programs.  Each and every sample was assigned an 
individual sample number.  In addition to the QA/QC procedures put in place by the assay 
laboratory a rigorous QA/QC routine was in place for all exploration completed by, or on behalf 
of Endeavour. The procedures in place include:  

· Standards (independently submitted commercial reference standards); 
· Blanks (previously assayed material returning less than detection assays); 
· Field duplicates (second sample collected in the field from the same source); and 
· Umpire assaying (second assay of prepared pulp at a second internationally 

accredited laboratory). 

Commercially available standards were purchased from Rocklabs and one was inserted in every 
batch of 20 consecutive sample numbers.  In the field, one blank sample (<5 ppb) was included 
in every batch of 20 samples.  As well, a single sample, from every 20, was a field duplicate.  
Duplicate RC samples were generated making a second 2 kg split at the rig, core samples were 
randomly divided into two samples from one assay interval. 

Results from the quality control samples were monitored as assay batches were received and 
where results were outside acceptable limits the entire batch was re-assayed. 

Umpire assays completed at Lakefield Canada correlated very well with the original assays. 

Results from the diamond-drill holes that twinned RC holes, correlated very well. 

Data reliability for surveying, sample collection and assaying is considered to be high based on 
the QAQC protocols and procedures, including; umpire assaying, down-hole surveys and data 
tracking via digital database, consistently used by Endeavour personnel. 

The data collected by Ashanti/Echo Bay and Endeavour was conducted in a professional 
manner by experienced geoscientists following industry standards and protocols. 

As the Qualified Person on Exploration for Etruscan and now Endeavour, Mr. K. Kirk Woodman, 
P. Geo. was responsible for monitoring all QAQC programs for the Youga Project since 2005 and 
has verified the data on an ongoing basis.

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
16.1 METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Testwork History 

The most recent metallurgical and comminution testwork was performed by Mintek on Youga 
samples A2 Main Pit, A2 Main Pit East and A2 West Satellite deposits in August 2004.  Sampling 
focussed on two main ore variations; the hanging wall high-grade ore, which is more intensely 
silicified, and the footwall spotty-grade ore, which is less intensely silicified. 

Prior to this, Mintek tested Youga samples Youga Y–1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Satellite YW–1, 2, 3 in 1999. 

Testwork was also performed by Hazen Research in Colorado USA, on three core samples 
termed Youga 1, Youga 2 and Youga 3, at an unknown earlier date. 

Testwork has largely been focused on the following areas: 

· Mineralogy 
· Gravity concentration 
· Reagent scouting tests 
· Preg-robbing assessment 
· Grind optimisation 
· Leach time optimisation 
· Carbon appraisal and CIP/CIL (carbon in pulp/ carbon in leach) modelling 
· Variability testing 
· Tailings grading and elemental analysis 
· Comminution tests. 

 
Ore Mineralogy 

Optical microscopy by Mintek in 1999 confirmed the predominant gangue material to be mainly 
silicates and some carbonate ankerite at 99 mass percent or more.  The sulphides are present in 
amounts of less than 1.0 mass percent (including Fe - oxides/hydroxides where sulphides have 
been oxidized). 

Gold searches were conducted to determine the gold occurrence and association in the Y2 and 
composite samples.  Gold was found to be predominantly associated with pyrite.  This included 
attachment to pyrite and locked in pyrite.  Some larger gold particles were found in the silicates. 

Mineralogical examinations confirmed the presence of fine, free gold within the ore.  67% of the 
gold detected in the composite sample was either liberated or attached to pyrite and should 
therefore be amenable to leaching.  The remaining gold was locked in pyrite (19%) and silicate 
(11%).  Gold particle sizes reported ranged from 1.3 microns to 12.8 microns.  All gold particles 
examined on the SEM ("scanning electron microscope") contained approximately 10% silver.

Metallurgical Sampling 

Sampling focussed on two main ore variations; the hanging wall high-grade ore, which is more 
intensely silicified, and the footwall spotty-grade ore, which is less intensely silicified.  Five 
40kg samples of ½ NQ core of the two ore variations were sent to Mintek.  Each variation was 
composed of samples that represented the various depths and ore grades and were bagged as 
separate assay intervals.  Samples were referred to as Shallow, Medium, Deep, South End and 
North End.  

Three composite samples were prepared according to grade.  The composites were called High 
Grade, Spotty Grade and Spotty-High Grade.  MDM decided to omit higher grade samples from 
the composites since these would have skewed the average head grade; much higher than that 
foreseen from mining. 

The geological assay results of the composites showed an average head grade of 3.89g/t for the 
combined High and Spotty grade material, with a range of 2.05g/t to 8.96g/t.  Previous testwork 
results support these grades, namely:  

· Mintek 1999 results for Youga Y1-5 samples averaged 4.27g/t, with a range from 2.6g/t 
to 8.0g/t 

· Hazen results for samples Youga 1-3 averaged 5.86g/t, ranging from 2.6g/t to 9.3g/t. 
 
Comminution Testwork 

The average Bond ball mill work index (BWI) for Youga at 106µm closing screen size is 
17.46kWh/t, the BWI values ranging from 16.57kWh/t to 18.22kWh/t.  These results indicate 
that Youga ore falls into the "Hard" ore category (15kWh/t - 20kWh/t).  For comparison: 

· Mintek 1999 BWI values ranged from 15.2kWh/t to 16.9kWh/t 
· Hazen BWI values ranged from 17.1kWh/t to 19.4 kWh/t. 

 
The average Bond rod mill work index (RWI) from the 2004 testwork is 16.57kWh/t at limiting 
screen size of 1180µm.  RWI values range from 14.64kWh/t to 18.76kWh/t, classifying the ore 
as "medium hard".  In comparison, Mintek 1999 RWI values ranged from 23.5kWh/t to 
25.8kWh/t. 

The ratio of BWI : RWI ranges from 0.83 to 1.04, indicating that the ore breaks down readily 
into the required size and responds well to SAG milling.  AG milling however is not an option. 

Abrasion index results ranged from 0.24 to 0.47 and the ore is considered "moderately 
abrasive". 

Drop weight testing showed that the average JK A * b value for Youga ore is 43.0, placing the ore 
in the "Moderately Hard" to "Hard" category. 

 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 41 

Gravity Recovery 

The work at Mintek produced an average gravity gold recovery of 31.9% to final hand panned 
concentrate, at an average recovered gold grade of 1235g/t.  Variability testing on the A2 West 
composite sample gave 19.2% gravity recovery.  Previous results are not directly comparable 
but also show a high proportion of gravity recoverable gold as follows:  

· Mintek 1999 composite sample gave 43% composite gravity recoverable gold 
· Mintek 1999 satellite ore composite had 54% gravity recoverable gold 
· Hazen work recovered between 64% to 77% of the gold to gravity concentrate. 

 
The presence of coarse recoverable gold in the Youga ores is certain and the need for a gravity 
recovery stage in the plant is confirmed.  Figure 16.1 shows the level of gravity recovery 
obtained at various grades.

Gravity Recovery at Varying Head Grades 

 
Cyanidation 

Latest testing at Mintek showed no evidence of preg-robbing in Youga ore.  Optimum leach time 
was determined to be 24 hours, since the increase in dissolution from 24 hours leach time to 48 
hours was relatively small.  Previous testwork performed by Mintek in 1999 demonstrated 
comparable results. 

Cyanide leaching of spotty and high grade gravity tails gave gold dissolution of 90% and 91.6% 
respectively.  A2 West composite sample gravity tail gave 91.7% gold extraction. 

Figure 16.2 shows level of recovery depending on the gravity tail grades.

Grade Recovery Relationship 

 
Heap Leaching Option 

Hazen testwork included heap leach simulation of Youga 1 whole ore, crushed to minus 
1.65mm.  Gold extraction was less than 60%.  Finer crushing to minus 833µm and cyanidation 
of the three ore types recovered up to 73% of the gold.  The results indicated that Youga ore is 
not amenable to heap leaching. 

Mintek 1999 heap leach testwork was performed on the Main-Satellite composite at a crush size 
of 70% passing 1mm and bottle-rolled at 50% m/m solids, pH 10-11, 5kg/t cyanide, no carbon 
and 7 days leach time.  A low recovery of 59% was obtained after 7 days of leaching.  80% of the 
gold recovery occurred on day 1 which led to the belief that only the free gold leached and 
majority of the gold that was not leached was in the coarse fraction and "locked" perhaps in 
silicates or pyrite. 

The carbon loading parameters for Youga ore show it is comparable to Witwatersrand type ores 
and satisfactory loadings and adsorption kinetics are expected. 

Flotation Option 

Flotation at a P80μm grind of 84μm to 119μm microns recovered 91% to 95% of the gold to 
flotation concentrate.  Higher gold and lower mass recovery was achieved at the finer grinds.   

Cyanidation of reground flotation concentrate gave an overall gold recovery of 89% 
(maximum). 

Grinding Optimization 

Optimum mill grind from 2004 testwork was determined to be 70% -75µm based on analysis of 
the incremental economic benefit and this grind was selected for plant design.  Optimum grind 
according to the 1999 testwork was 100% -150µm.

Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 43 

Reagent Consumption 

Oxygen decay rates were measured using the five main ore samples at P80 = 75µm grind, 20% 
solids and pH 10.5.  Mintek benchmarked the oxygen decay rates against a typical 
Witwatersrand ore, which has an uptake rate of 2g/t/h with an oxygen consumption of 0.3kg/t.  
Youga sample rates were 2.3 times the benchmark figures.  The oxygen consumption was 
calculated as 0.86kg/t, allowing a safety factor of 20%. 

Cyanide consumption during the most recent testwork ranged from 0.02kg/t to 0.31kg/t.  
Repeat titrations were requested to verify these low values, since the 1999 average results 
were 0.55kg/t (main sample) and 0.36kg/t (satellite sample).  Optimum cyanide addition was 
determined as 0.5kg/t based on analysis of the incremental economic benefit. 

Lime consumption ranged from 0.51kg/t to 0.73kg/t during 2004 testwork.  Similar results 
were obtained in 1999, with the main sample ranging from 0.31kg/t to 1.33kg/t.  For the 1999 
satellite sample lime consumption was 0.6 kg/t.  Plant lime addition has been set at 0.76kg/t. 

Overall laboratory gold extraction from gravity and cyanidation combined has been calculated 
as: 

· High grade 95.5% to 98.3% 
· Spotty grade 92.7% to 95.0% 
· A2 West composite 93.3%. 

The expected plant recoveries for High and Spotty grade material are 96.0% and 93.1% 
respectively, with the A2 West composite reporting 93.3%. 
 
Figure 16.3 provides overall recovery obtained for various grade samples.

16.2 MINERAL PROCESSING 

Process Design  

The Youga plant is designed to recover gold from a mixed quartz and feldspar orebody at a total 
treatment rate of 1 million tonnes per annum.  The average feed grade for Youga over the life of 
the mine is expected to be 2.5g/t.  

Engineering firm MDM designed the plant as part of the feasibility study update. 

Testwork conducted by a number of laboratories confirmed the ore is amenable to grinding and 
gravity concentration, followed by conventional cyanide leaching of the gravity tailings and the 
circuit is designed accordingly. 

During the mine life the Youga plant will receive ore from the Youga Main and East pits as well 
as the satellite West pits.  Ore from these pits has been classified as competent rock (not soft or 
saprolitic) and this has been a key factor in the process design and equipment selection. 

A previous feasibility study on Youga, performed by Lycopodium for Ashanti, included a 
primary crusher and SAG mill.  Pebble crushing was omitted, but was noted as being likely to be 
included (required) in the circuit. 

Comminution testwork results in the MDM study confirmed ore amenability to SAG milling and 
confirmed the pebble crusher, but also introduced the requirement for a secondary ball mill. 
Initially the design proceeded on the basis of this circuit but it soon became apparent that the 
cost of two new mills was going to be very high, combined with a long lead (delivery) time for 
these items.  This prompted MDM to examine the alternative of a three stage crushing and ball 
mill circuit.  After review of some layout options it was decided to use a single ROM bin and 
three stage crushing, with a mill feed stockpile, resulting in significant capital cost savings 
compared to two new mills. 

Testwork conducted by Mintek and reviewed by MDM showed that a gravity concentration 
stage was required to achieve overall high gold extraction.  The gravity circuit consists of a 
centrifugal gravity concentrator, with final gravity concentrate produced on a shaking table. 

Milled ore is processed in a conventional leach/CIL circuit consisting of a pre-leach tank 
followed by a series of five CIL tanks.  MDM has used this circuit frequently as it has been found 
to offer the benefit of lower capital cost (compared to leach-CIL) as well as operational 
simplicity. 

Youga is fortunate in having a continuous water supply available from the Nakambé River.  This 
has removed the need for a thickener in the circuit; hence CIL tailings slurry is pumped directly 
to the tailings dam. 

Processing Operations 

The Youga processing plant uses the conventional gravity/CIL gold recovery process (see 
Figure 18.2), similar to various facilities in operation in West Africa and consists of a 3 stage

17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
17.1 MINERAL RESOURCES 
 

The Youga gold project is an operating mine. 

The mineral resource models supporting the current mineral reserves estimates were most 
recently updated by RSG and MDM in 2006 as part of the Youga Feasibility Study Update 
prepared for Endeavour by RSG and MDM. The mineral resource interpolations were 
documented in the Youga Feasibility Study Update. Since 2006 no additional exploration was 
conducted on the A2 Main, A2 East, A2 West deposits 1, 2 and 3. Hence the mineral resource 
estimates prepared in 2006 remain current for these deposits and are the ones in use at the 
mine.  K. Kirk Woodman and Adrian de Freitas (Qualified Persons for the Youga Mine) accept 
these mineral resources and mineral reserves and have subsequently worked with them for the 
reporting in this technical report. 

Resource estimates were prepared by Alain Mouton in 2008 for the Nanga and Tail deposits as 
internal reports prepared for Etruscan.  The Nanga and Tail estimates have not changed and no 
additional information is available, therefore the mineral resource estimates prepared in 2008 
remain current for these deposits. 

Recent drilling on the Zergore and A2NE deposits has allowed for mineral resource estimates to 
be completed, and these constitute new mineral resources not considered in earlier technical 
reports. 

Data 

The database used during the resource interpolation includes 274 core holes, 380 RC holes and 
180 surface trenches (Table 17.1).

Geological Modelling 

Three-dimensional solid bodies representing the extent of the gold mineralization were 
constructed for each auriferous zone, based on sectional and level plan interpretations. The 
modelling resulted in the creation of a number of wireframes based on the gold mineralization 
(Table 17.3). All logged geological data including lithology, veining, sulphide content, alteration, 
etc, have been used when constructing the grade shells where possible.

Table 17.3  
Modelled Grade Shells by Deposit 

 
Grade shells were produced based on a gold threshold at a 0.3 g/t cutoff for the A2 Main, A2 
East, A2 West deposits 1, 2 and 3, a 0.5 g/t cutoff was utilized for the Nanga and Tail deposits 
while a 0.15 g/t cutoff was utilized for the Zergore deposit and 0.25 g/t for the A2NE deposit.  
Intercepts below this threshold would occasionally be included to account for geologic 
continuity.  Minimum widths of the interpretations were 1 to 2 m depending on continuity and 
grade of the mineralization.

Based on logging information, a number of sub-domain surfaces were used to subdivide the 
gold mineralization based on density, mining and properties of each of the rock types were 
created. The sets of surfaces that were modeled included: two surfaces defining the boundaries 
between oxidation levels of the sulphide minerals (oxidized, transition and fresh) and three 
surfaces defining the boundaries between intensity of weathering (overburden, saprolite, 
saprock and bedrock). The weathering profile was not modeled for the Zergore deposit, but is 
recommended for the next evaluation. 

Assay Compositing 

Gold assay data from the earlier resource models (A2 Main, A2 East, A2 West deposits 1, 2 and 
3) were composited to 3 m lengths and used to interpolate gold grades into a block model. The 
decision to produce 3 m composites was based primarily on the envisaged bench height being 
2.5 m, with the composite representing the approximate bench height.  All missing data and 
intervals less than 1m length for A2 Main/East and A2 West 2 and 3, and 1.5m for A2 West 1, 
were excluded from the compositing process. RC, diamond core and trench data were 
considered for the study. 

A 5 m composite length was used for the gold assay data from the Nanga deposit to reflect the 5 m 
bench height currently used at the Youga mine. 

The Tail, A2NE and Zergore gold assay data were composited to 2 m lengths, starting from the 
drill hole collar and down the hole, breaking at each grade shell, topographic, and weathering 
boundary.  The 2 m size was selected as a compromise between the Selective Mining Unit 
("SMU") scale, and the minimum interpreted grade shell widths of 1 to 2 m.  Composites were 
coded using the grade shell and weathering solids, into the FLAG and FLAG2 items, respectively. 
Composited data were extracted for each domain and basic statistics were analyzed. 

Statistical Analysis 

Statistical analysis has been undertaken for each of the evaluated deposits based on composites 
generated from available exploration data, coded by the weathering and oxidation profiles, and 
grade shells.  The statistical investigations included descriptive and distribution analyses, 
assessment of outliers and indicator statistics. 

Typical of gold deposits, the grade distributions for the composite data are positively skewed, 
with the coefficient of variation ("CV") for several envelopes being moderate to high, indicating 
the need for substantial adjustment of the mean grade and/or restriction of high grades in some 
domains. 

Grade Capping 

Assessment of the high grade composites was completed to determine a series of high grade 
cuts or caps.  These cuts were determined for each deposit and applied to the composites 
(Table 17.4).  It is noted that relatively little difference is observed in the mean grade pre and 
post application of the high grade cuts, hence there is little reduction in metal.

1069 being capped at 20g/t.  Outside of grade shells, 3 samples >1g/t had their search restricted to 10m x 5m x 5m. 

 
Variography 

Grade and indicator variography was generated for the gold composites generated for the A2 
Main, A2 East, A2 West deposits 1, 2 and 3.  The variography was based on the composited data 
with high grade cuts applied prior to the variogram generation. 

Grade and indicator variograms were generated for domains 1, 2, 3 and 4 at the A2 Main/East 
deposit, while the hanging-wall domains 5, 6 and 7 contained insufficient data to allow robust 
variographic analysis to be undertaken. 

For the Zergore and A2NE deposits, down-the-hole and directional correlograms for gold were 
constructed using the commercially available Sage2001 software. Table 17.5 lists the variogram 
parameters.

Block Modelling 

A series of three dimensional block models were generated for deposits to enable grade 
evaluation via a combination of MIK, and OK grade interpolations and inverse distance 
methods.  The block model block size, in each case, was selected to represent the available data, 
the data characteristics (variability as defined by variography) and current mining practices 
(Table 17.6).  Sub-blocking was used for each deposit with the exception of Zergore which was a 
percent model.

Block model development was completed in the Vulcan software package for each deposit 
except for Zergore which was completed with Gemcom.  Mineralized domain and weathering 
domain coding was established in the block model, based on the modelled wireframe 
constraints.  In addition, sufficient variables were created to enable recording of the results 
from MIK, selective mining estimates, estimation statistics, density stratification, and resource 
classification. 

Grade Interpolation 

Gold grade interpolation has been completed using a combination of MIK, OK and ID methods.  
Grade interpolation within the grade shells was completed in 1 to 3 passes (Table 17.7).

Grade Interpolation Validation 

Visual and statistical checks were completed on the generated resource model to ensure the 
model was robust.  The statistical checks and visual validation completed during validation of 
the A2 Main, A2 East, A2 West deposits 1, 2 and 3 include the following; 

· Comparison of the kriging (whole grade estimate) versus the mean of the composite 
dataset, including weighting where appropriate to account for data clustering. 

· A comparison of the grade estimate against a theoretical change-of-support analysis 
generated via the discrete Gaussian change-of-support.   

· Visual checks of cross sections and plans.  

Mining and processing of the A2 Main and A2 East deposits is well underway and the A2 West 
Zone 1 deposit has been almost completely mined out. The reconciliation between resource 
modelling, grade-control modelling and milled ore has proven very good. 

The Nanga deposit resource model was calculated using OK and validated by ID2, considering 
the techniques returned very similar results only the ID2 method was utilized for the Tail 
interpolation. 

The Zergore and A2NE models were validated using the following methods; 

· Nearest-neighbour ("NN") models were generated to represent the declustered 
composites and to validate the OK model. 

· Swath plot validation compared NN (2 m), NN (5 m), ID3 and OK estimates for 
Indicated blocks. 

· Visual checks of cross sections and plans. 
· Change-of-support grade–tonnage curves (Herco plots) were compared to the OK, 

ID and 2 m NN grade–tonnage curves for tonnes and gold grades inside the grade 
shells. 

Acceptable levels of mean reproduction are noted between the block models and input 
composite data and overall the grade interpolations are reasonable. 

Mineral Resource Classification 

The Mineral Resources have been classified according to the "CIM Definition Standards for 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December, 2005)" as a combination of Measured, 
Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources based on the confidence level. 

Confidence levels were determined for the A2 Main, A2 East, A2 West deposits 1, 2, and 3, 
Nanga and Tail based on a number of key criteria including; drilling, logging, and sampling 
techniques, QAQC results, density of drill data and the continuity of the geometry and grade in 
each of the various grade shells. 

Additionally for the A2NE deposit a drill spacing study was performed on the data included in 
the resource interpolation, to determine resource categorization based on drill hole spacing 
sufficient to predict potential production with reasonable precision. The following criteria to 
classify blocks into confidence categories resulted from this study: 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 54 

· Measured mineral resources: 12.5 m spacing is required along strike and 9 m 
distance along the dip of the orebody. However, no Measured resource was defined 
due to the small volumes that would be affected. 

· Indicated mineral resources: 25 m spacing is required along strike and 18 m 
distance along the dip of the orebody. 

· Inferred mineral resources: All blocks within the grade shells received interpolated 
grade, and were considered to be candidates for Inferred classification at a 
minimum.  Outside the grade shells, any block that received grade during estimation 
was considered to be a candidate for Inferred classification at a minimum. 

The Zergore drill hole spacing study quantified the drill spacing needed such that the estimation 
error in grade would be within the +/-15% guidelines.  The following criteria were used to 
classify blocks into confidence categories:  

· Measured mineral resources:  drill-hole spacing between 12.5 m x 10 m and 25 m x 10 
m. 

· Indicated mineral resources: drill-hole spacing of 30 m x 20 m.  
 
Mineral Resource Statement

17.2 MINERAL RESERVES 
 

The Youga Mine end 2010 mineral reserve estimates are based on the mineral resources 
reported above and after consideration of the modifying parameters as described below. 

The deposits evaluated for the purpose of preparing the Youga Mine end 2010 LOM plan and 
Mineral Reserves are the A2Main, A2East, West2 and West3 pits, with the West 1 pit having 
been mined to depletion in 2008/2009.  

In 2010 mining operations at Youga concentrated on the A2Main and A2East Pits from which a 
total of 8,112 k tonnes of material were mined to deliver 894 k tonnes of ore at an average 
grade of 3.05g/t au containing 87.6 k ounces to the ROM pad.  

The Youga mining operations were and continue to be carried out safely and efficiently.  
Recently in the A2Main pit the main ramp was relocated from the west to the east side of the pit 
in order to allow geotechnical work to be completed, and should ensure the safe operation of 
the pit to its ultimate depth.  

 

End 2010 Youga Ore Reserve Estimate 

During the course of 2010, a technical and operational re-organization / re-engineering process 
commenced at the Youga Gold Mine including a re-evaluation of the mineral resources and 
mineral reserves.   

Based on the updated, end of 2010, Measured and Indicated mineral resources for the various 
mineral deposits at the Youga Gold Mine, the Proven and Probable mineral reserves for the 
open pit operations as of end December 2010 are estimated to be 4,477 k tonnes at a grade of 
2.51 g/t containing 362 k ounces of gold. This includes 112 k tonnes of ROM pad ore stockpile at 
a grade of 1.91g/t au containing 7 k ounces of gold. 

As of December 31, 2010 the breakdown of the Youga Gold Mine mineral reserves by category 
are shown in Table 17.10.

Table 17.9  
Youga Mine Mineral Reserves as of December 31, 2010 

 
Not included in the open pit mineral reserves is a total of approximately 1,600 k tonnes of 
marginal grade material averaging 0.71g/t Au containing 37 k ounces which is within the pit 
shells, 193 k tonnes of stockpiled marginal grade material averaging 0.73g/t Au containing 5K 
ounces of gold, and 128 k tonnes of Inferred mineral resource at 1.70 g/t containing 7.0 k 
ounces that is contained within the pit shells. The current marginal grade limit for the open pit 
operation is estimated to be 0.5 g/t.  This material will be re-evaluated later as to whether it is 
deemed economic to be processed. 

The pit designs include a total of 21.9 million tonnes of waste material with an overall strip 
ratio of 4.9:1. Total material mined over the life of mine amounts to 26.4 million tonnes. 

Modifying Parameters 

The key modifying parameters upon which the end 2010 mineral reserve estimates were made

Comments on Modifying Parameter Variances 

Overall, the technical modifying parameters remained similar to those used in the Youga 
Feasibility Study Update but there were some minor refinements as described below.   

The principal variations in technical modifying parameters were: 

· Processing Plant Recovery: Metallurgical recovery was reduced from 95% to 94% to 
reflect the recoveries being realized at Youga when operating the processing plant at a 
throughput rate of 130tph. The slightly lower recovery results from the achieved grind 
being slightly below the design specification of 70% passing 75microns. 

· Mining dilution and recovery were revised from 5% and 97% respectively to 8% and 
95% to reflect the mineralization distribution characteristics as reflected in recent 
grade control drilling and modeling work and operating practices over the past 2 years.   

On the costing side the principal variations to the modifying parameters were: 

· Processing costs have been revised from US$11.8 per tonne to US$19.5 per tonne to 
reflect realized energy, reagent and grinding media consumption patterns and prices 
and engineering maintenance costs in 2010.  

· G&A costs have been increased from US$5.0 per tonne to US$7.0 per tonne to reflect 
current labour / staffing costs.    

· The gold price has been increased from US$700 per ounce to US$1000 per ounce for pit 
optimization purposes.

Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 58 

It is noted that following commissioning in 2008, and throughout 2009 the Youga Mine 
experienced a number of operational and financial difficulties which resulted in under 
performance of the operation and in turn an inability to obtain reliable operating and cost 
performance data upon which to base operating efficiency and cost parameters for ore reserve 
evaluation.  

As a result, at the end of 2009 the mineral reserves were based on parameters which turned out 
to be significantly different from what was actually achieved in 2010.  

In 2010, the mine operating performance and record keeping improved and the operating and 
cost modifying parameters established by 2010 performance and used for the end 2010 mineral 
reserve estimation are considered to be more accurate, representative and realistic.  

Mineral Reserve Reporting Guidelines 

The above mineral reserve estimate has been determined and reported in accordance with 
Canadian National Instrument 43-101 "Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects" of 
December 30, 2005 and based on CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves adopted by the CIM Council in December 11, 2005. Furthermore, the reserve 
classifications are also consistent with the "Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves" of December 2004 ("JORC Code") as prepared by the Joint 
Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of 
Geoscientists and Mineral Council of Australia (JORC). 

The reserve classifications for both reporting systems are essentially the same, with only minor 
semantic differences in the naming conventions.  Reserves are called "Ore Reserves" under the 
JORC Code and "Mineral Reserves" under the CIM standards.  "Proved Reserves" under the JORC 
code are called "Proven Reserves" under the CIM Standards.   
 
The reported reserves have been compiled by Samuel Kwesi Takyi under the supervision of 
Adrian de Freitas, who is a Member of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (IOM3 
Membership Number 46625).  Mr. de Freitas is the Qualified Person responsible for the mineral 
reserves at Youga Gold Mine.  Samuel Kwesi Takyi obtained a degree in mining engineering 
from the Tarkwa School of mines in Ghana in 2003 and is employed by the Burkina Mining 
Company as the Mine Manager of Youga Mine.  Mr. Kwesi Takyi has previously worked with 
Goldfields Ghana Ltd and Anglogold Ashanti Limited in open pit operations on the Tarkwa 
goldbelt in Ghana for a period of 6 years.

18.0 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS ON 
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES 

 
18.1 MINING OPERATIONS 
Mining Sequence 

The Youga mine commenced operations in 2008 with open pit mining and CIL processing 
facilities and during the period to end 2010 a total of 193,316 ounces of gold had been 
recovered from 2,515,203 million tonnes of ore from the A2Main, A2West1 and A2East pits.  

The A2West 1 pit was mined to depletion during 2009 and operations are currently taking 
place at the A2Main and A2East pits.  

The A2East pit is scheduled to be completed during the course of 2011 and mining will then be 
limited to the remaining ore reserves A2West2 and A2West3 pits in parallel with the A2Main 
pit for the remaining life of mine or until additional ore reserves are generated. 

Mining Operations 

Mining operations, currently focused on the A2Main and A2East pits (Figure 18.1), are being 
undertaken by a mining Contractor, PW Mining International Ltd ("PW").

The use of RC grade control drilling, on a 10m x 10m pattern with assays every 2.0m sample 
and interpretation/modeling of the results by mine geologists is the primary method of grade 
control used for ore delineation and blasthole drilling the Project.  Investigations are ongoing 
with regards to optimizing sample length and sample pattern to ensure appropriate statistical 
methodologies are utilized to minimize dilution and maximize ore extraction. 

Ore zones are drilled sufficiently to cover the expected zone plus some overlap to ensure 
sufficient drilling is planned.  Drilling quantities are estimated by equating to approximately 
120% of the expected ore zones are grade control drilled. .  All RC holes are assumed to be 
drilled at a 50º angle. 

Contract Mining 

The main mine production equipment that PW selected for the Youga Project includes an O&K 
RH120 (265 tonnes) back hoe excavator, two RH40 100 tonnes back hoe excavators, 5 x CAT 
777 and 3 x CAT 773 off-highway haul trucks with a payload capacity of 86t and 54t 
respectively.  In addition, PW have included an O&K RH40 (100 tonnes) excavator for backup 
and other miscellaneous work. 

The original mining contract which had a tender contract value of $81million is due to expire on 
December 31, 2012.  

Pit Optimization 

Pit optimization studies have been undertaken using the resource models as originally 
developed by RSG Global and described in this section as the basis for pit optimization. 

Pit optimizations were carried out for A2 Main, A2 East, A2 West 2 and A2 West 3.   

The Whittle Four-X pit optimization software package was used for this work.  The Whittle 
Four-X model development was carried out in Vulcan.  Whittle Four-X deals with the amount of 
metal in a block, not grade.  Knowing the tonnage and the metal in a block, Whittle Four-X can 
calculate the grade of a block.  To that end the metal content of a block was calculated using the 
grade estimate derived from the MIK resource estimate.  The 1.14g/t and 0.99g/t cutoff 
indicators were used for the calculation of the metal content in a block for A2 Main and A2 East, 
and A2 West respectively. 

A mining dilution of 8% at 0.0g/t grade is added to the pit optimization, whilst the mining 
recovery is set at 95%. 

The input parameters, adopted for the pit optimization, have been derived from a combination 
of historical mine performance and input from specialists and advisors. The principal input 
parameters used in the pit optimization and the source from which these parameters were 
derived are listed in Table 18.1 below.  All references to monetary values are denominated in 
United States of America dollars, unless specifically stated otherwise.

Grade control costs were based on a RC drilling rate of $44 per meter and assaying cost of $6 
per assay. 

The processing costs were determined on the basis of 2010 actual costs adjusted as necessary 
for any anticipated changes resulting from changes in the operational environment in future 
years.   The recoveries initially supplied by MDM in the feasibility stage have been reduced from 
95% to 94% for ore reserve estimation purposes. This is based on operating performance of the 
mine since the commencement of production and after taking account of recent plant 
metallurgical reviews. This is considered to be appropriate for 2011 ore reserve estimation 
purposes and has been applied for all pits.

The mine general and administration costs were determined from 2010 cost records and were 
estimated at approximately $7.0 per tonne milled on a 1.0 million tonnes per annum basis. 

A Burkina Faso government royalty of 3% of revenue was included in the pit optimization. It is 
noted that the royalty rate was adjusted, effective December 1, 2010, to a sliding scale ranging 
from 3 to 5% depending on the price of gold.  

The pit wall slope parameters determined for the Youga pits were initially based on 
geotechnical test work from the A2 main deposit and advice from Golder Associates.  The pit 
wall slope parameters were subdivided in a number of sectors representing the various 
potential structural trends that were identified.  In summary, the overall slope angles adopted 
for the pit optimization ranged from between 44º and 51º. In 2010 a pit cutback was designed 
and the slope angles were retained after consultation with SRK geotechnical personnel. 

A summary of the principal economic input parameters used in the pit optimizations are 
summarized in Table 18.3 below.

Summary Whittle Four-X Input Parameters 

 
Pit Optimization Setup 

The pit optimizations were carried out for a wide range of Au prices, from as low as $600/oz to 
a maximum of $2000/oz.   

The Whittle Four-X financial analysis was carried out using the following base assumptions and 
parameters: 

· Mill throughput: 1.0Mtpa 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 63 

· Mill limiting – i.e. sufficient waste is removed each period to enable the required milling 
rate to be maintained 

· Discount rate – 10% 
· Base case Au price - $1000/oz. 

Three cash-flows were produced for each analysis: 

· Undiscounted Operating Cash-flow. 
· Best Case Discounted Operating Cash-flow – Each incremental pit is removed prior to 

advancing to the next adjacent incremental pit.  The cash-flow schedule is the equivalent 
of multiple pushbacks. 

· Worst Case Discounted Operating Cash-flow – Each bench is mined out prior to moving 
to the next bench, using the optimization block height as the default bench height.  The 
cash-flow schedule is the equivalent of top down 'flat' mining. 

An actual mining schedule will most likely lie between the two extremes of Worst Case and Best 
Case as described above. 

The cash-flows, as described above, are exclusive of any capital expenditure or Project start-up 
costs and should be used for pit optimization comparison purposes only.  No Net Present Value 
(NPV) can be derived from these cash-flows. 

Pit Optimization Results 

A2 Main and A2 East 

Based on Measured and Indicated resources only and at a gold price of $1000/oz, the optimum 
pit shell contains some 2.7 million tonnes of ore at a grade of 3.12/t Au, for approximately 
279,000 ounces of recovered Au metal.  Some 17.9 million tonnes of waste are contained within 
the pit shell with a stripping ratio of 6.4:1.   

A2 West 2 

Based on a gold price of $1000/oz, the optimum pit shell at the A2 West 2 deposit contains 
some 1.06 million tonnes of ore at a grade of 1.81 g/t Au, for approximately 62,000 ounces of 
recovered Au metal.  Some 5.6 million tonnes of waste are contained within the pit shell with a 
stripping ratio of 5.4:1.  

A2 West 3 

Based on a gold price of $1000/oz, the optimum pit shell at the A2 West 3 deposit contains 
some 0.7 million tonnes of ore at a grade of 1.73 g/t Au, for approximately 37,000 ounces of 
recovered Au metal.  Some 3.7 million tonnes of waste are contained within the pit shell with a 
stripping ratio of 5.7:1.   

Pit Design 

The A2 Main, A2 East revised pit designs that were developed for the 2010 production year 
have broadly been retained for the end 2010 ore reserve evaluation update. 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso

The optimum pit shells of the July 2006 pit optimizations showed little differences with the 
December 2010 pit designs and, as such, no re-design was considered necessary apart from 
revision arising from the relocation of the Main pit ramp and west wall cutback. 

An 20m wide, dual access ramp has been included in  the detailed mine design work for A2 
Main pit, which allows for a safe operating width of 3 truck widths plus a windrow in the case of 
a Cat777D dump truck, which is the largest truck currently in operation at the mine site.  

The designs were based on the Golder provided inter-ramp slope angles for Youga.  The inter 
ramp slope angles range from 45º to 56º.  The berm width is 4m for every 10m in vertical wall 
height. 

A2 East reaches a depth of 60m and a dual lane access ramp with a width of 18m was designed 
from surface to allow passage for two Cat 773 dumper truck. 

A2 West 2 comprises 3 pits, namely South, Central and North.  A2 West 2 North the largest of 
the 3 and has been designed with a dual lane from surface to 30m depth and a single lane access 
ramp from 30m depth.  Both A2 West 2 South and Central are shallow and have been designed 
with a single lane access ramp from the 30m depth. 

A2 West North is intersected by the Zéra River and it is envisaged that it will be mined in the 
dry season, from October to May. 

A2 West 3 has been designed with a dual lane ramp for Cat 773 to a depth of 40m and a single 
lane access ramp from the 40m depth. 

The ramp design parameters are listed below:  

· Ramp width 20m reducing to 12m for the last 30 to 40m of vertical height 
· Gradient 1:10. 

A minimum mining width of 30m has been assumed for both pits.  This width suits the backhoe 
excavator loading method and the Caterpillar 777D turning circle of 28.4m. 

Pit staging was considered appropriate for the A2 Main deposit only. 

Table 18.4 provides a summary of the material breakdown as contained within the latest pit 
designs.  It is noted that pit designs contain Inferred resources of approximately 128 ktonnes 
containing 7 koz insitu Au metal.

Waste Dumps 

The waste dumps have been designed to Western Australian standards and the parameters 
used are: 

· Face slope 20º 
· Bench height 20m 
· Berm width 10m 
· Overall slope 17º 

The waste dump capacities have been based on a swell factor of 25%.  No allowance for any in-
pit or exhausted pit backfilling has been made. 

The waste dump positions have been determined by taking into account geologically 
prospective ground (where sterilization drilling is still to be carried out), the existing drainage 
patterns, waste haulage profiles and the space and infrastructure issues required for the 
planned operations. 

The A2 Main Waste Dump, located north of both the A2 Main and the A2 East pits, is 
approximately 40m high, covers 40Ha and has a capacity of 12.6Mm3, with ample capacity to 
extend the dump. 

The A2 West 1 Waste Dump, located northwest of A2 West 1 pit, is approximately 20m high, 
covers 6Ha and has a capacity of 0.4Mm3, with ample capacity to extend the dump if, as a result

Mine Production Schedule 

The mine production schedule was based on the pit designs as described above.   

The scheduling periods adopted for the mine production schedule comprises of years. 

The mine production schedule was developed using the manual scheduling technique of Runge 
Xpac Scheduling Package. 

Scheduling was carried out on a bench by bench basis for all the pit designs following the most 
practical approach, including the cutbacks recently been carried out at the A2 Main. 

The following constraints were set as a target for the mine production schedule: 

· Ore processing rate    1.0Mtpa 
· Maximum total material movement  8.6Mtpa 

The Life of Mine produces an average of 74,000oz of Au per year ranging from 84,000oz in Year 
2011 to 20,000oz in Year 2015, although Year 2015 is a part year estimated at approximately 6 
months. 

The average total material movement is approximately 7.7Mtpa, with a maximum mining rate 
of 8.4Mtpa in Year 2011 to Year 2013 and a minimum annualized mining rate of 1Mtpa in Year 
2014. 

Table 18.5 summarizes the Life of Mine schedule that has been developed for the Youga Gold 
Mine for the Year 2011.

Geotechnical Input 

The original pit geotechnical work for the BFS was completed by Golder Associates Inc and their 
work has been summarized in the report 'Phase 1 Geotechnical Study in Support of Feasibility 
Study' dated August 2004.

In summary, Golder states that the pit slope stability will be controlled by a combination of 
material properties, bedrock structure and operating practices.  Compressive strength test 
work indicates that the rock is generally high strength. 

Groundwater is unlikely to have a significant influence on the overall pit slope stability and it is 
expected that the de-watering necessary to maintain reasonably dry operating conditions in the 
pit bottom will be adequate for slope stability purposes. 

In 2010 SRK were retained to undertake a desk top and subsequent detailed review of the 
stability of the Main pit due to the pit experiencing a number of small localized wall failures. As 
a result of the desktop review, the pit ramp was relocated to the east side of the pit and the 
West wall was cutback to improve face conditions. The detailed review involved the drilling of 6 
oriented diamond core holes around the perimeter and to the base of the pit shell, detailed 
geological and geotechnical mapping of major and minor structural features within the pit and 
the drilling and equipping of a number of piezometer holes to measure the water table. This 
geotechnical review engineering work is currently ongoing and geotechnical appraisals of the 
pits will be an ongoing feature of the Youga operations.     

Hydrogeology and Hydrology Input 

The hydrogeology, hydrology and surface water aspects at the Youga Mine were originally 
assessed by Knight Piésold ("KP") in 1999. Their findings are summarized in the report "Youga 
Mine Project Feasibility Study – Tailings Facility, Plant Site, Pit Slopes and Stormwater 
Management'. 

The wet season extends from mid-April until mid-October.  Peak rainfall months are June, July, 
August and September with a total yearly rainfall of between 700mm to 1,000mm. 

The only significant aspect of surface drainage affecting the Youga Project is the seasonal Zéra 
River that flows approximately 400m to the south of A2 Main and A2 East pit area and a 
seasonal tributary of the Zéra River that runs just east of A2 Main pit.  This tributary transects 
the A2 East pit, necessitating a diversion.  The Zéra River itself transects the northern pit of the 
A2 West 2.  This pit is relatively small and it has been assumed that it will be mined in the dry 
season. 

It was estimated by KP that dewatering requirements may range between 5 l/s and 15 l/s 
(400m3/d to 1300m3/d).  Estimated dewatering volumes are relatively small and the pits are 
being excavated in relatively low permeability material (other than occasional open fractures 
that may be intercepted at depth).  As such, it is likely that it will not be possible to obtain the 
dewatering abstraction from bores alone, although this cannot be confirmed without 
exploratory drilling for groundwater.  The greatest potential for bores is likely to be found in 
fracture zones along the strike of the orebody, and exploratory drilling targets during any 
future study should be developed accordingly.  With either bores and/or sumps, it is possible 
that due to the generally low and anisotropic permeability, complete dewatering of the pit 
slopes may not be achieved.  It is reported that the main pit may be up to 270m deep (Note: 
current pit design for A2 Main is approximately 200m deep) and without substantial 
dewatering of the pit walls, hydrostatic pressures behind the walls may be considerable.

Horizontal drain holes may be required to encourage drainage of the pit-slopes, and the water 
produced needs to be controlled to ensure that water in the pit does not cause erosion/ponding 
problems.  Geotechnical studies will be required once a more detailed assessment of dewatering 
impacts has been made. 

Furthermore, KP stated that the estimates of dewatering requirements are first-pass estimates 
only and groundwater exploration drilling and testing and more detailed dewatering 
assessment (possibly including some groundwater modelling) will be required at the feasibility 
stage to confirm dewatering estimates. 

Since the commencement of mining in 2008, the Main and East pits have been extended in 
depth to 60m and 40m respectively and little water has been encountered emanating from the 
pit walls and floors. As the pits are deepened sump and pumping reticulation systems will be 
established on an ongoing basis to remove ground water and inflows from rain events.   

 

18.2 PROCESSING OPERATIONS 
 
The Youga processing plant uses the conventional gravity/CIL gold recovery process (see 
Figure 18.2), similar to various facilities in operation in West Africa and consists of a 3 stage 
crushing operation, ball milling, gravity concentration and cyanidation by carbon-in-leach (CIL). 
Pressure Zadra elution is utilized for recovery of gold from loaded carbon.  

Primary Crushing 

Run of Mine (ROM) ore is delivered to the ROM feed bin by front-end loader (FEL).  Ore is 
withdrawn from the ROM bin by a variable speed apron feeder to the primary crusher.  Crushed 
ore reports to the crusher discharge conveyor, delivering ore to the Secondary and Tertiary 
Crushing circuits. 

Secondary and Tertiary Crushing 

Primary crushed ore is conveyed to the scalping screen.  Oversize discharges from the top deck 
to the conveyor feeding the secondary crusher surge bin, whilst the bottom deck oversize 
discharge to the conveyor feeding the tertiary crusher surge bin, undersize (12mm) passes 
through the bottom deck and is conveyed to the stockpile.  Recycled ore is withdrawn from the 
two surge bins by pan feeders onto two dedicated secondary and tertiary cone crushers. The 
crushed material is conveyed to the sizing screen, the +12mm oversize from this screen is 
returned to the tertiary crusher feed bin conveyor, undersize (-12mm) from this screen is 
discharged to the stockpile feed conveyor. 

Crushed Ore Stockpile 

A combination of three vibrating feeders withdraws ore from the crushed ore stockpile onto the 
mill feed conveyor.  Dry hydrated lime is fed via a rotary valve and screw feeder, from the lime 
bin onto the mill feed conveyor.

Milling 

Crushed ore and lime are fed to the single stage, closed circuit ball mill.  Gravity scalping screen 
oversize, mill inlet process water, gravity tails and cyclone underflow slurry also report to the 
mill inlet hopper.  The mill product discharges via a trommel screen to a pump sump, dilution 
water also report to the mill sump.  Oversize from the trommel reports to a bunker for removal 
by Bobcat or front-end loader. 

A single stage, variable speed mill discharge pump draws slurry from the sump and feeds the 
cluster of hydrocyclones.  A standby mill discharge pump is installed.  A mass flow meter is 
provided on the cyclone feed stream to control density and flowrate of the cyclone feed.  Gland 
service water is provided to the mill pumps.

Fine solids pass through the cyclone vortex finders at a solids concentration of 41% and 
gravitate to the CIL section.  Coarse solids exit the cyclone spigots as a dense slurry, a slipper 
box allows to divert a fraction of it (~20%) to feed the gravity recovery circuit.  The balance of 
the cyclone underflow returns to the ball mill feed. 

Gravity Concentration 

The bleed stream diverted to gravity concentration from the mill cyclone cluster underflow is 
passed over a vibrating scalping screen to remove coarse (+2mm) particles, which gravitate 
back to the mill inlet chute.  Spray water is applied to the screen deck to improve screening. 

Screen underflow gravitates to the centrifugal bowl type concentrator for recovery of the coarse 
free gold particles.  Concentrator tails gravitate to the mill feed inlet.  Primary gravity 
concentrate is discharged from the concentrator during the periodic flush cycle.  This 
concentrate flows into a storage tank where it is stored and periodically fed to a shaking table 
located in the gold room for upgrading.  Table concentrate is collected in a small bin and stored 
in the safe until future calcination while tails are pumped back to the mill feed inlet. 

Carbon in Leach 

Mill cyclone overflow slurry flows onto a linear trash screen for removal of natural and mining 
debris such as woodchips, cloth, plastic and wire.  Woodchips must be removed as these can 
adsorb gold, while the other debris will blind the interstage screens. 

The trash screen underflow gravitates through a slurry sampler and into the first leach tank 
where cyanide solution is added.  Tramp screen overflow reports to wire screen to stop larger 
pieces, excess water and sand is drained to the mill sump. 

Slurry overflows the mechanically agitated leach tank and gravitates through five subsequent, 
mechanically agitated, Carbon in Leach (CIL) tanks to enable maximum possible dissolution of 
gold as a cyanide complex and subsequent adsorption onto activated carbon. 

Each CIL tank is equipped with an interstage screen mechanism, with a cylindrical basket-type 
stainless steel wedge-wire screen surface for retention of activated carbon in the tank. 

Air blowers installed on the top of the CIL tank platform provide air in the slurry through the 
agitator shaft in order to improve oxygenation of the ore. 

Tailings 

Tailings slurry from the last CIL tank gravitates to the tailings vibrating screen for carbon 
recovery in the event of damage, wear or incorrect installation of the final stage interstage 
screen.  Carbon recovered on the screen will report to a bulk bag for re-use. 

Tailings, discharging from the tailings carbon recovery screen, gravitate via a sampler to the 
tailings pump tank from where it is pumped to the slimes dam.  Tailings return water reports to 
the process water tank.  The spillage pump directs all spillage to the tailings linear screen.

Acid Wash and Elution 

Loaded carbon from CIL is received in the acid wash tank.  Once the 4-tonne batch has been 
accumulated, it is washed with dilute hydrochloric acid (at 2-3% HCl) to remove scale.  On 
completion of acid washing, the acid washed carbon is rinsed and then dropped into the elution 
column.  Periodically, when the dilute acid wash liquor is too contaminated, it is neutralized 
with excess caustic soda and pumped to the tailings tank. 

The elution section is a pressurized Zadra system.  Loaded carbon is eluted by pumping a hot 
caustic cyanide solution (eluant), typically 1.0% – 3.0% NaOH and 0.2% – 0.6% NaCN, through 
the column at 130°C under pressure.  Gold adsorbed onto the loaded carbon is eluted off the 
carbon and recovered in the eluate solution.  The eluate is pumped through electrowinning cells 
to remove gold by electroplating onto steel wool.  Electrowinning tails return to the eluant tank. 

Carbon Regeneration 

Upon completion of the elution cycle, the carbon batch is hydraulically transferred to the feed 
hopper of the regeneration kiln or, on occasion to the CIL circuit.  Barren carbon is thermally 
regenerated in an electric kiln to remove organic contaminants and to maintain the activity of 
the carbon.  Regenerated carbon is subsequently transferred to the last CIL tank. 

Electrowinning and Gold Recovery 

A pump circulates the pregnant electrolyte from elution through the two electrowinning cells, 
located in the gold room for security, for approximately 16 hours or until the gold concentration 
in the electrolyte is below 10mg/l.  Spent electrolyte is periodically pumped back to the CIL 
circuit when contaminant build up in the solution becomes unacceptable. 

Loaded cathodes are removed from the electrowinning cells at regular intervals and together 
with the final concentrate from Gravity Concentration loaded onto the calcine oven trays and 
calcined overnight (up to sixteen hours) at ~800oC, ensuring that the contents are sufficiently 
oxidized and dried.  Once calcining is complete, the trays are removed from the calcine oven, 
cooled and weighed.  The net content mass is then calculated and the required quantity of flux 
determined.  

Dried, weighed calcine is fluxed and charged into a crucible designed for the smelting furnace.  
The crucible is heated in the diesel fired smelting furnace to approximately 1160oC for four 
hours, before being removed from the furnace for pouring into moulds.  Once the gold is cool, it 
is removed from the mould, cleaned of all adhering slag, weighed, sampled, numbered and 
stored in the gold room safe for later dispatch to the selected refinery. 

Reagents 

There are facilities for the storage, mixing if required and distribution of the following 
consumables: grinding media, sodium cyanide, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, hydrated lime 
and activated carbon. 

Reagents that are added as solution are mixed in a common area with a mixing tank and storage 
tank. Some of the reagents, for example cyanide are supplied in one tonne bulk-bags that are

lifted by a dedicated mono-rail and electric hoist and discharged using a bag breaker on each 
tank. Each reagent mixing station will include a bag breaker/drum tipper, mixing tank and 
agitator, storage tank (and agitator if required), transfer pump and dosing pumps. 

Grinding balls are delivered to the stockpile area in drums and transferred to the mill feed 
conveyor. This activity takes place on a shift basis as required. 

Cyanide solution is prepared in a dedicated reagent mixing facility. Cyanide is supplied to the 
site in one tonne bulk-bags and mixed in an agitated tank at 25% solution strength. It is 
transferred and dosed to the plant using centrifugal pumps and a ring main system. 

Caustic is supplied in bulk-boxes, stored in the reagent storeroom, and made up in a 16m3 
mixing tank using raw water.  The 20% caustic solution is discharged to the cyanide/caustic 
dosing pot and the acid/caustic dosing pot, each having a volume of 1.5m3, when required. 

Strong, 32% hydrochloric acid is delivered in 200 liters drums and offloaded using a drum 
pump to a storage tank.  Acid is to be pumped as required to points of use in the elution process. 

The pH control is provided in the milling and CIL circuits using hydrated lime.  Lime is delivered 
by bulk bag and transferred to a silo of 40 tonnes capacity from where it is fed dry to the mill 
feed conveyor using a rotary valve and screw feeder.  No water is added. 

High activity carbon is provided in 500kg bulk-bags and added to the CIL circuit as required. 

Compressed air supply 

Two plant air compressors were provided, as well as one instrument air compressor.  Generally, 
only one plant compressor runs, but in case of high air demand, both units may be run in 
parallel.  The compressors are sized to be capable of delivering ± 1200Nm³/h of air each.  
Compressed air is supplied throughout the plant for general use. 

Process Water 

Decanted excess settled water from the tailings dam pool gravitates to the return water dam.  A 
return water pump is provided at the return dam for recycling of return water to the plant 
process water tank.  Operating and standby pumps are installed at the process water tank. 

Process water is reticulated throughout the plant where required, from the 300 m3 process 
water tank, servicing specific process requirements as well as general hose points. 

Raw Water Supply 

Raw water is pumped from the Nakambé River and is stored in a desanding holding tank from 
where it is pumped over 11km to the raw water pond.  Raw water is pumped to various points 
in the plant that require water free of suspended solids or chemical contamination.  Raw water 
is used in the elution section for making up acid wash and eluant solutions.  The raw water 
pond is also the supply for the gland service water pumps.  Standby raw water and gland water 
pumps are installed.

The fire-water for the plant is also obtained from the raw water pond.  The fire system consists 
of a main fire pump, an electric jockey (pressure booster) pump, a diesel driven pump, a fire 
pipe manifold and hydrants in chosen locations throughout the plant. 

Potable Water Supply 

Potable water is be supplied from the raw water pond, and is treated through a filtration and 
sterilization system before being stored in a dedicated 20m3 potable water tank.  Potable water 
supply pumps for the plant,   the various drinking water and ablution facilities throughout the 
plant and offices, and all safety showers on site. 

Tailings Management 

Digby Wells and Associates (DWA) was appointed to provide consultancy services for the 
final/construction design of the proposed gold tailings facility at Youga Gold Mine in Burkina 
Faso, West Africa. This facility was designed to accommodate 6.6 million tonnes of tailings for a 
life of mine of 6.6 years which is adequate for the current life of mine plan. 

The site for the tailings disposal facility had been identified by Knight Piésold (Australia) in a 
previous study. This site was accepted by Etruscan as the preferred site and thus no other 
possible site locations were investigated, although a slight possibility existed that the site may 
be underlain by some minor ore deposit.  

The tailings dam covers an area of 41ha and the return water dam an area of 9ha. 

The geotechnical investigation completed included the proposed tailings dam and plant site 
area. The general soil profile in the tailings dam area comprises clayey topsoil, average 0,4m 
thick, underlain by the clayey gravel pebble marker between 0.2m and 0.9m thickness. The 
residual soils below the pebble marker generally consist of sandy and silty clay of low to 
medium plasticity, which usually gradually grades with depth to very soft, highly weathered 
rock. Schist rock was generally not encountered in the test pits (2m to 3m deep) in the tailings 
dam site area, except along a shallow rock area to the south-east of the site and along a narrow 
localized linear zone extending almost to the centre of the site. Rock in these areas was 
encountered within 1m depth.  

Further geotechnical investigations were conducted during the final design phase, it was 
concluded that no fatal flaws could be noticed regarding the geology. 

It was decided to base the design of the tailings and return water dam on South African 
Standards. Youga Gold Project ore samples were treated in a pilot plant to assist with 
manufacturing samples of the tailings material. A 300g tailings sample was submitted to a soil 
laboratory to determine the grading and specific gravity (SG) of the material. These results 
indicated that the deposition method to be used is spigotting combined with a paddock system. 

The starter walls were constructed using overburden waste rock from the mining operations 
and pebble marker removed from the dam foundation.  

The starter wall height varies between 1m and 6m (maximum elevation of RL 234m).  The 
raising of the paddock walls will be done using overburden waste . The lifts will be 2.0m high at

a time and the overall slope of the outside wall will be 1 (v) in 3 (h). The average rate of rise of 
the tailings dam will be 1,84m per year, which is relatively low.  

Provision was made for the installation of filter drains along the inside toe of the starter walls to 
control the static water level inside the dam. The  decant system is a conventional precast 
decant ring system comprising concrete rings of 510mm internal diameter stacked on top of 
each other. 

The return water dam has been lined with a high density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic liner and 
the embankments were constructed using overburden waste rock from the mining operation.  

This facility can store five days' process water and the first 15 minutes of the 1 in 100 year 
storm event. A reinforced concrete sump is constructed before the return water dam inlet to 
collect any silt before reaching the return water dam.  

The calculated factor of safety for the stability of the tailings dam slopes is 1.4. It has been  
recommended that piezometers be installed for continual monitoring of the static water level 
inside the tailings dam as the stability of the dam walls is related to the static head on the 
impoundment walls.  

Piezometers have been installed to monitor groundwater quality upstream and downstream of 
the TSF. 

The safety classification of the tailings dam focused on the potential impact of the tailings dam 
on the surrounding area and took cognizance of the likelihood of a failure occurring. The initial 
criteria applicable for Youga tailings dam indicate that it will be a high hazard facility. 

The remoteness of the site, the footprint, and the lack of sensitive environments lead to the 
preliminary classification of the facility as a residue deposit that has apart from possible 
cyanide poisoning, no potentially significant impact on the environment. 

The TSF has been in operation for approximately three years and the storage capacity 
established in initial construction phase is scheduled to be filled by Q3 of 2011. In Q4 of 2010 
construction works on the first lift of the impoundment walls commenced and the storage 
capacity will be increased from the 234mRL to the 236m RL by the end of Q1 2011. This will 
provide adequate storage capacity for the mine production until the end of 2012. 

Design review of the facility is presently ongoing to establish the possibility of extending the 
impoundment footprint to the North (should this be required for extended mine life) and to 
design and construct a gravity fed emergency spill way on natural ground in the south eastern 
section of the dam. 

 

18.3 INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
Water  

Water is taken from the Nakambé River using a submersible pump anchored on the riverbank 
including stand-by to ensure that there is an uninterrupted water supply to the plant.  Power to

the pumps will be via an overhead line running from the plant to the water extraction point at 
the river.  The raw water from the Nakambé River is pumped to a raw water storage pond 
located close to the plant.  The pond supplies water to the plant raw water tank as well as 
supplying raw water to the process water tank to supplement the tailings dam water supply 
when the process water dam runs low. 

Potable is produced at the plant from river raw water.  This water is passed through a filtering 
and sterilization system to clarify and kill off biological organisms before it is stored for 
distribution to the camp and plant. 

The tailings dam incorporates a return water decant system linked to a return water pond.  
Reclaim water is pumped to the process water tank within the plant area for re-use in the 
process. 

Electricity 

Burkina Faso has no infrastructure close enough to supply power to the Youga plant.  The 
option of generating power on site with diesel-powered generators has been implemented as a 
back-up solution while main power is supplied from the Ghanaian grid.  A new power line 
running between Zebila and the Youga site has been installed, as well as the associated 
transformers and switchgear to supply power to the plant grid.  The 34kV/11kV switchyard 
consists of a pole mounted fused isolator, a 34kV outdoor circuit breaker and a 34kV/11kV 
10MVA power transformer.  The indoor 11kV switchgear panel consists of an incomer with 
protection and power metering, power factor correction, ball mill contactor/circuit breaker, 
five transformer feeders and overhead line/minisub feeders. 

The motor control centers (MCC's) are of the fully detachable plug-in type for ease of 
maintenance.  The MCC's have been designed to service specific areas of the plant, and the 
drives, including the variable speed drives, requiring emergency standby power have been 
equipped with auto changeover incomers.  Grounding networks is looped around substations 
and shared by both high-voltage and low-voltage units. 

Access 

The main access from Ouagadougou to site for heavy vehicles is via the towns of Manga and 
Zabre,  since this is the best maintained and constructed road to site.  Plant access roads were 
constructed on laterite base and are maintained and upgraded on an as required basis.   The 
haul roads are constructed on a similar base but are wider and covered by waste rock.  The 
construction of the haul roads and ROM pad was in the mining contractor's scope. 

A substantial bridge has been built across the Zéra River which divides the mine camp and the 
mine operating infrastructure in order to avoid isolation of the sites during periods of heavy 
down pour. 

In the future, an airstrip for light aircraft may be constructed along the East pit mine haul road 
to provide an alternative emergency medical evacuation option for personnel.

Buildings 

At the process plant the administration office block consist of 500m2 prefabricated building 
and accommodate financial, purchasing, HR and HSE staff, adjacent to it is the infirmary and 
another office for the geologists, surveyors and mining team.  Other offices within the 
processing area are used by the maintenance and process plant supervisors. 

The workshop and reagent stores are located within the plant high security area.   

Sub-contractors facilities 

A comprehensively equipped laboratory is provided at the plant to cater for the process control, 
metallurgical accounting, mine assay and environmental monitoring.  Equipment were supplied 
and are maintained by Abilab/ALS that runs the laboratory. 

Fuel and oil storage is supplied under contract to TOTAL, facilities include two 200m3 
horizontal tanks, fuel service area for both light and heavy vehicles (including high capacity 
filling pumps) a covered area for storage of lubricant and offices for the contractor staff.  

Fire protection 

Portable fire extinguishers are placed outside of the offices, sleeping quarters, kitchens, 
workshops and stores and distributed around the plant site for fighting small fires.   

The MCC rooms are equipped with incomer cutoffs to trip the power feeding to the MCC room 
should a fire break out.   

Waste and sewerage 

Solid wastes are buried in a dedicated facility within the mine lease area. This site consists of a 
series of pits (cells) which will be filled with waste materials and sealed once filled to design 
capacity.    

Sewerage is collected in septic tanks, and drains away through French drains.  The camp is 
located on a hilltop, and so the soakaway of the French drains run away from the 
accommodation units. 

Communications 

Area is under coverage of more than one cell phone companies and a standalone VSAT system 
allows Internet and voice transmissions that are carried on the same signal using Voice over IP 
(VOIP) protocol.   

Mine mobile communications are done via handheld mobile radio sets, with a base station 
located near the centre of operations. 

Transport 

The site vehicle fleet of pick-ups is used for the transport of materials and personnel to and 
from Ouagadougou and between the mine site and camp.

Contracted busses provide transportation to work for personnel living in the nearby villages 
and Ouagadougou. 

Security 

The main entrance security office is located on the Main Plant access road.  All visitors to the 
mine complex report to this security gate for authorization prior to entry. Personal protection 
equipment (PPE) is available for issue form this point if required.    

A closed circuit television (CCTV) system is installed in the plant overseeing the mill, cyclones, 
concentrator and gold room to monitor activities. This system is being upgraded with smart 
camera technology in Q1 of 2011 to provide improved quality of image, coverage of operations 
and image storage and review capacity.  

Accommodation  

The accommodation camp is located on a hill top approximately 3.5km South of the plant and is 
approximately 1.5km SO of the A2 main pit.  All services have been provided to the camp and 
plant since there was no existing water or power infrastructure in the region at the time of 
construction of the mine.  

There are five stand-alone two-bedroom houses with a separate bathroom, separate toilet, 
living room and a small kitchenette for senior management. Managers and supervisors housing 
consists of a 30m2 single room with its own shower, toilet and basin and sufficient space for a 
desk and a living area with provision for a television connection point. All enclosed rooms are 
air-conditioned. 

The camp can accommodate 100 persons. 

The laundry, a prefabricated structure 42m2 in size, is equipped with eight industrial washing 
machines. The room includes a washbasin and worktop for ironing and folding clothes. 

The kitchen and dining facility is fully equipped to prepare and serve food as required by the 
mine shift roster 

Television signals are received from satellite television systems.   

The camp recreation area consists of a bar, games area, open veranda, swimming pool and a 
gym.  

Personnel 

Although nationals from Burkina Faso are filling most operation and management positions 
within the company, some  selected posts requiring specific skills or experience not available 
within Burkina Faso have been filled by expatriates.  In addition to performing their job 
function expatriate personnel are expected to transfer knowledge and expertise to develop the 
capabilities of their national staff.  

The workforce is under the control of a General Manager who is supported by two divisional 
heads and six line managers.

18.5 RECOVERABILITY 
Actual overall recoveries (gravity + leaching) from current operation at Youga processing plant 
are very close to the projections made in the feasibility study.  

Gravity recoveries average 35% where it was expected from the test work to be in the +30% 
range.    

None of the new targets that are currently being explored have gone through a complete 
metallurgical test work program. Although some preliminary testing by bottle roll analyses 
showed good recoveries after 24h leach. 

 

18.6 MARKETS 
Gold output from the Youga Mine operation is in the form of doré bars containing 
approximately 86 percent gold and 12% silver, the balance being copper and other minor 
metals.  Silver credits are received from the refiner. 

The doré is shipped to Europe for refining. Metalor is the contract refiner and they retain Group 
4 Securicor to transport the bullion from Youga to their facilities. Responsibility for the gold 
changes hands at the gold room gate.  



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 82 

Based on typical refining charges, the breakdown of costs is set out below: 

· Refinery Charge  US$0.72/oz gold  (US$0.70/oz doré) 
· Shipping  US$3.22/oz gold 
· Insurance  US$0.40/oz gold (0.1 percent of metal value) 
· Total   US$4.34/oz gold. 

Penalties are applied in the refining contract for any impurities but these are rare occurrences 
and the penalties are not excessive, the main impact being on the delay in final payment due to 
extended refining periods.  

The current refining contract is valid until the end of 2011. 

 

18.7 CONTRACTS 
During the mine development and construction phase the following contractors were 
employed:  

· GBM Projects Limited of London, England was retained to complete the detailed design 
engineering and procurement of the processing plant 

· The overall development construct and manage phase of the Project was also the 
responsibility of GBM with various support functions provided directly by Etruscan 

· PW retained to carry out all mining work, including the bulk earthworks for the TSF 
· Digby Wells were retained to carry out the TSF design, PW executed the construction 

and Knight Piesold were retained for construction supervision 
· The overall transport coordination during construction was contracted to Bertling. 

As on end 2010, the main contractors involved with the mine are:  

· Drill, blast, load and haul :   PW International 
· Fuel supply:    Total Burkina Faso 
· Contract security staff:   BIS – local contractor from Ouagadougou 
· Catering  and camp management: ATS – All  Terrain Services 
· Contract personnel transport:  Local contractor from Ouagadougou 
· Refining:    Metalor. 

The various contracts were awarded following comparative bidding process, prices are within 
the industry range and comparable to other operations in Burkina Faso or West Africa. 

 

18.8 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Legislative Background 

A complementary environmental study for the Youga Project was considered as essential since 
the proposed development was a variation to the original mining plan and associated 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) upon which Ashanti Goldfields Company and Echo Bay 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 83 

Mines Joint Venture was given an Exploitation Permit by the Government of Burkina Faso in 
April 2003.  This requirement was not governed by any Local Legislation but was considered as 
good practice for this type of large-scale industrial project developed in rural Africa. 

Organization of the Study 

The original and updated environmental impact assessment studies have been prepared by SGS 
Environment, a Division of SGS Laboratory Services Ghana Limited (SGS), in partnership with 
SOCREGE, a local consultancy firm based in Ouagadougou.  The latter was responsible for both 
local coordination and collection of most baseline data and information. 

Baseline Survey 

The Youga exploitation permit falls within the Sudanese climatic type but, due to its 
geographical position, it is largely influenced by the south Sudano-Sahelian zone.  Yearly rainfall 
was estimated to be in the region of 900mm, for about 60 days of rain. The highest 
temperatures are experienced at the end of the dry season in April or May.  Annual evaporation 
is high, in the region of 2870mm. 

The Youga project area is entirely rural and, generally, has a good savannah woodland cover.   

There is no industrial source of gaseous or particulate emissions and ambient air quality is 
good.  However, the Harmattan winds from the Sahara desert bring each year, from November 
to February, large quantities of fine dust particulates over the region. 

The Youga Project area is entirely located in the catchment area of the Nakambé River 
(formerly White Volta).  The Zéra secondary basin drains the project area from west to east.  
Along its course, several small steams flow into this waterway including the Gossé.  The Zéra 
River joins the Nakambé a few kilometres after crossing the border with Ghana. 

With the exception of the spring fed Gossé stream and the Nakambé, which has its flow 
regulated since the opening of the Bagré hydroelectric dam in 1995, all these water bodies are 
seasonal in nature.  They flow continuously only during the rainy season, though flows in the 
Zéra tributary can be very substantial. 

Results of the physio-chemical analysis show that the quality of water is typical of which is 
usually found in the South-Sudanese tropical savannah regions.  Very low concentrations of 
arsenic, below the World Health Organisation standard for potable water, were also detected in 
all samples. Microbiological contamination of surface waters is common. 

Two aquifer regimes have been identified in the Youga project area: a shallow aquifer located in 
the weathered formations and a deeper fractured aquifer.  In general, however, aquifers are low 
yielding and not suited to intensive or high-capacity developments using drilled bores. 

Groundwater resources are important sources of water supply for domestic and drinking 
purposes as well as non-intensive agricultural use.  Water Quality did not exhibit any 
constituent of concern. 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 84 

The Youga project area, according to Fontes and Guinko (1995), falls within the South-Sudanese 
sahelien zone.  All the species that were recorded are typical of the general Guinea-Congolia-
Sudania regional endemics as listed by White (1983). 

Vegetation and floral diversity at Youga are considered as relatively rich but anthropogenic 
degradation (mainly exploitation of wood), though less important than other places in Burkina 
Faso, is becoming visible over several sites. 

Riparian forests such as the sacred and protected area of the Gossé source and forest pockets 
left on site are major shelters for birds, medium and small mammals, insects, reptiles and 
amphibians, particularly during the dry season. Human activity including agriculture, 
movement of livestock, gold washing and hunting (by gun or by stone) tend however to 
significantly disturb this fauna. 

The pedological study of the Youga gold project area revealed heterogeneity of soils, by virtue 
of their morphological nature and agricultural potential.  In general, these soils exhibit several 
factors limiting agricultural production. 

The project area is predominantly rural, the south mainly consists of cultivated and inhabited 
lands and the north is generally forestland, covered by savannah woodlands, which presents 
signs of anthropogenic influences. 

The Youga project area falls within the Zabré district of the Boulgou Region in southern Burkina 
Faso.  The area designated for the proposed mining operation will be located 3km to the north-
west of the village of Youga and 1km to the west of a small orpaillage site known as "Zergoré".  
Youga is situated at 26km from Zabré, the nearest administrative centre, and some 2km from 
the Ghana border. 

The Koussassé represent the dominant ethnic majority, but other groups include the Peuls, the 
Mossis and the Bissas. 

Socio-political relations between the various communities are still preferentially administered 
by traditional authorities, particularly when it comes to land management and acquisition. 

The economy of the district has always been dominated by agriculture followed by animal 
rearing and since 1993, traditional mining ("orpaillage").  Farming is usually on a small scale 
and designed to meet local food needs. 

Immigration is limited to the inhabitants of neighbouring villages and states like Ghana who 
come only during the rainy season to farm.  Emigration is very developed in the area and 
concerns mainly the youth. 

Reflecting on the development potential of the Youga area, the development process has been 
hampered mainly by a highly restricted internal and external road network, the poor spatial 
distribution of severely weak social infrastructures (school, health centre, etc.) and the lack of 
an educated and skilled manpower resource. 

A number of alternative, potential developments were considered in the early stages of the 
project planning.  Alternatives were screened out based on financial, social, technical or 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 85 

environmental constraints. Alternatives included, but were not limited to the placement of 
infrastructure, the mining process, ore beneficiation and the decision whether to mine or not 
(the "no – go" alternative). 

Potential impacts associated with the proposed development were identified and assessed.  
Potential impacts relating to airborne particulate during operation, intermittent noise and 
vibrations from blasting, site hydrology, surface water quality, site hydrogeology and 
groundwater quality, erosion of soils, limited displacement of people and loss of agricultural 
land were considered the most significant. 

Typical mitigation measures similar to those already in use by several existing operations in 
Burkina Faso or neighbouring countries have been put in place for all of the identified potential 
impacts.   

Based on the implementation of the mitigation measures, all of the potential impacts of local 
significance were reduced.  Furthermore, the implementation of a detailed resettlement and 
crop compensation programs complemented by proactive community relation have reduced 
the potential socio – economic impacts to non – significant. 

The potential impact of the proposed Youga Gold Project (YGP) on the various environments is 
considered to be of low significance. 

An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the project has been prepared which extends 
from the construction phase to the post closure of the YGP and includes the following topics: 

· Corporate Commitment and Environmental Policy 
· Environmental Management Structure 
· Financial Allocations 
· Outline of the Project 
· Existing Natural Environment 
· Existing Socio-Economic Environment 
· Environmental Impacts and Mitigation of the Project 
· Waste Management 
· Community Relations and Resettlement 
· Monitoring Programs 
· Reclamation, Closure and Decommissioning 
· Emergency Response Plans (Fire Protection, Tailings Dam Failure, Solution Excursion, 

etc.) 
· Auditing & Review. 

Endeavour is committed to manage all phases of the proposed YGP in accordance with best 
environmental practices such that the medium and long term social and environmental impacts 
are minimized. 

A reclamation and closure/decommissioning plan has been prepared for the Youga mine and is 
being used to monitor and manage the mines performance in respect of its remedial work 
obligations.   



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 86 

Endeavour will undertake progressive reclamation during Project Life and will 
close/decommission the project with the objectives of elimination of any public safety hazards, 
and of providing a post mining land use compatible with the prevailing beneficial land-uses of 
the area. 

The reclamation plan encompasses potential end-land use, reclamation principles, land 
reclamation methods, possible types of vegetation, post monitoring and management 
techniques and financial aspects. 

The closure/decommissioning plan includes the environmental objectives of Endeavour as a 
corporate body, followed by a provisional plan for rehabilitation and site closure. 

A preliminary, but detailed assessment of reclamation and closure costs has been prepared.     

Finally, it should be pointed out that a holder of a mining title or beneficiary of a license must 
open an account at the Central Bank of West African States or in a commercial bank in Burkina 
Faso and make deposits in a fiduciary account for the purpose of constituting capital to cover 
the costs of implementation of the environmental conservation and rehabilitation program.  
The amount thus used is exempted from the tax on commercial and industrial profits. Youga 
mine is in compliance with its financial obligations in respect of the environmental holding 
fund. 

 

18.9 TAXES, DUTIES AND ROYALTIES 
A number of guarantees and tax allowances are included in the Burkina Faso tax and mining 
legislation. The state guarantees the right of ownership, freedom of management, free transfer 
of capital and returns and stability of agreements made under these laws.   

A variety of tax reliefs, including accelerated depreciation, are conceded to mining projects.  To 
the extent that the annual amortization of sunk costs and plant and equipment gives rise to a 
loss for tax purposes, this loss may be carried forward indefinitely. 

Initially, a Burkina Faso Mining Regulation provided for a 3 percent gross proceeds royalty 
payable to the State of Burkina Faso on all gold production in the country.  This royalty is 
deductible for purposes of calculating Burkina Faso corporate income tax.  Life-of-mine 
royalties payable to the State of Burkina Faso total US$8.9 million or US$1.34 per tonne of ore 
processed. 

This Regulation had been amended in March 2010 but its application had been suspended until 
a new amendment was adopted on December 31st, 2010 (retroactive to December 1st, 2010) 
and under its current application, it increases the State royalty to 4% and 5% if the spot gold 
price is between US$1000 and US$1300 per ounce and above US$1300 per ounce respectively.  

BMC is subject to taxes and fees as described below: 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 87 

· a fixed fee at the time the large scale exploitation permit is granted, renewed, 
transferred or extended, ranging from CFA 5,000,000 (US$9,200) to CFA 15,000,000 
(US$30,000); 

· an annual surface fee starting at CFA 7,500,000 (US$15,000) per year per square 
kilometre for the first five years and graduating to CFA 10,000,000 (US$20,000) for 
years six to ten and CFA 15,000,000 (US$30,000) for years eleven and thereafter; 

· a business profits income tax at the rate of 17,5% which is the basic rate of 27,5% less 
10points; 

· a tax at the rate of 6.25% (basic rate of 12.5% less 50%) on the income from dividends 
or other forms of returns on investment distributed to shareholders of corporations 
holding an exploitation permit; 

· a withholding tax at the rate of 6.25% (basic rate of 12.5% less 50%) on interest paid on 
loans to local and foreign creditors; 

· the value-added tax (VAT) at the rate of 18% on goods and services.  However, BMC 
applies monthly and obtains a full reimbursement of VAT paid because it exclusively 
exports goods;  

· custom duties at the rate of 7.5% (5% service tax, 1% statistical tax, 0.5% community 
solidarity fund, 1% community deduction) for the import of materials, raw material, 
construction materials, fuel and lubricants destined to energy production and 
functioning of vehicles and equipment, including parts and spare parts during the 
exploitation phase.  However, an application under the Temporary Admission Regime 
could be filed; 

· withholding tax at the rate of 10% on remuneration for services paid to suppliers  who 
do not have a place of business in Burkina and 5% for suppliers who have a place of 
business in Burkina Faso.  This tax must be remitted to the State; and 

· registration tax except for the registration of documents pertaining an increase in the 
share capital of BMC. 

BMC has benefited or still benefits from the following exonerations:  

· VAT on equipment purchased locally or imported and geological/mining type of 
services during the mine development and plant construction  phase for a maximum of 
3 years;  

· custom duties for the import of materials, raw material, construction materials, fuel and 
lubricants destined to energy production and functioning of vehicles and equipment, 
including parts and spare parts during the construction phase except the statistical tax 
(1%), the community solidarity fund tax PCS (0.5%), the community deduction PC (1%) 
and all future community taxes that could be adopted; and 

· minimum flat rate tax on industrial and commercial professions (IMFPIC) (0.5% of 
turnover), patent contribution, employer and apprentice tax (TPA) (3% of employees 
gross salaries including in kind benefits) and tax on property in mortmain (TBM) (10% 
of 50% of the value of buildings and land), during the exploitation phase for a period 
equal to half the projected mine life.

Health and Safety 

To ensure the health and safety of the all workers, and due to the remoteness, a doctor 
(employed by Burkina Mining Company) forms part of the site management team, and the 
medical clinic and first aid facilities on site are sufficient to deal with emergency treatment and 
stabilization before transport by ambulance to the nearest hospital.  In terms of backup, the 
mine ambulance evacuates to Ouagadougou in case of a medical emergency requiring 
evacuation.  

The Youga mine has a dedicated Safety, Occupational Health and Environment department 
which operates under the guidance of a set of principles which define the regulatory and 
corporate governance commitments of the Youga mine in respect of the manner in which it 
conducts its business.   

Risk Assessment 

At the Youga project development and construction stage the framework for risk assessment 
was based on the Australian Standard for Risk Management, AS4360:1999. 

The principal risks to the Project that were assessed as either extreme or high require further 
work on mitigation during detailed engineering and are discussed below. The current status of 
these risks has been added below each paragraph. 

a) The highest risk identified concerns the political risk to the mining operation.  This was 
considered high because political influences in the country could stop the mining 
operation.  Burkina Faso is, however, a politically stable country so the likelihood of any 
political upheaval is low.  

Current: Political risk is not considered as being high, in the past few years Burkina 
Faso's track record as a developing gold region has been one of the best in the West 
Africa Region  

b) The risk to the gold produced was considered minimal, as the mining rights are well 
defined.  However, if there were to be political upheavals in the country, the gold 
produced on the plant, was the plant to continue to operate, may be under threat.  This 
would directly threaten the Project due to the potential loss in revenues.  

Current: Not considered as a high risk. 

c) The time taken to ramp up to full production as a result of late mobilization of crews 
with the necessary skill levels to meet production targets was a risk for the Project.  

Current: Project is completed and has been re-engineered by Endeavour to be operated 
at / above its design levels.  

d) Pay scales have been developed to allow the company to attract the necessary quality 
staff. A comprehensive training strategy was to be implemented using international 
trainers, OEM training specialists, experienced staff from within Burkina Faso and other 
West African mining regions, and an in-house training function. Despite the surge in 



 Technical Report and Update of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Youga Gold Mine, Burkina Faso 

 

 93 

gold developments in the West Africa Region, there is a relatively high availability of 
personnel semi-skilled / experienced in mining operations within the Region. However 
if there is a shortage of the higher level qualified and experienced skills and in addition 
to being competitive in the recruiting market, the company is focusing on in house 
development of key personnel to meet its requirements. 

Current: No change  

e) Proven and relatively simple technology would be utilized.  

Current: No change. 

f) Due to the plant's remote location, and the limited other substantial mining activity in 
Burkina Faso, the plant would need to carry a comprehensive store of spares.  This was 
considered critical as the availability of suitable spares in the country is unreliable at 
best, and specialized spare parts must be imported.  Delays to operations would occur if 
no suitable spares are available on site.  

Current: No change. 

g) The power supply from Ghana is from a spur line originating in the town of Zebilla,  
which is about 25 km from the Youga plant site.  This line crosses the border, and could 
threaten the economical operation of the plant if the supply was unreliable.  This risk 
has been mitigated by a clear agreement between BMC and the Ghanaian and Burkinabe 
power supply authorities.  Complementary discussions are scheduled with both utilities 
over the commercial structuring of the supply agreement.  

Current: Power supply agreement is working well with Ghana Power authorities – back 
up site generating plant is maintained at full capacity  

h) Burkina Faso has a well-defined rainy season when torrential rains fall over short 
periods.  This rain could potentially damage the roads on site, cutting off supplies and 
feed from the mines.  Good road construction and prompt maintenance have minimized 
the risk to the roads. The watercourses that will need to be crossed rise rapidly when 
heavy rains fall, and thus endanger the bridges that will be used to cross them. This risk 
has been addressed by the design and construction of a robust bridge to cross the major 
watercourse on the route to site.  If this bridge does become damaged, however, it will 
not affect the operation of the mine and plant in the short term as the plant and mine 
are on the same side of the river.  

Current: No serious situations observed since the commencement of operations. 

The risks to the Youga Mine LOM plan and operations are currently considered to be low, with 
outcomes being sensitive to negative commercial trends that might develop in respect of the 
gold price and the impact of inflationary effects on power, fuels, labour and spare components 
because of the global economic situation.

Challenges and opportunities 

From a technical stand point, the 2010 re-engineering of the Youga mine in respect of both its 
management and operational practices has been very positive. However, challenges remain in 
respect of ensuring that: 

-   Renegotiating mining contract with PW to achieve improved productivity and costs 
- The ongoing geotechnical evaluation of the main pit confirms that the stability of the pit 

is acceptable.   
- The processing plant mill classification and CIL Leach systems are further optimized to 

improve stability and operating performance within the overall circuit. 
- Increasing the work standards of the plant operators and maintenance staff through the 

implementation of improved training programs.  

Opportunities exist for the Youga mine in respect of: 

- Evaluating owner fleet mining reducing operating costs. 
- Achieving additional design, cost and productivity efficiencies that will result in 

expanded current pits and LOM. 
- Realization of the exploration potential of the significant land holding and walk up to 

drill targets to provide additional mineral resources and reserves to extend mine life. 
- Increasing plant throughput to reduce unit overhead costs and lower the cutoff grade 

resulting in increased ore reserves. 

 

18.12 MINE LIFE 
Based on current ore reserves and mine planning, the Youga LOM Business Plan extends from 
2011 through to 2015, with a total of 339,876 ounces of gold being produced during this period.  

A substantial accelerated exploration program is underway on the Youga Exploitation Permit 
on which there are a number of targets relating to the Main and East pits and the Zergore, 
A2NE, Tail, Nanga and Le Duc deposits as well as other proximal targets on adjoining 
exploration leases, particularly the Ouaré deposit on the Bitou2 Exploration Permit. 

Mineral resources delineated as a result of this program will be subjected to technical and 
economic evaluation to generate additional ore reserves to extend the economic life of the 
Youga mine.

The pertinent observations and interpretations which have been developed in producing this 
report on the Youga deposits are detailed in the sections above. 

 
20.2 CONCLUSIONS 
 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
 

· In the opinion of the authors, the exploration database for the Youga project is reliable 
for the purpose of resource estimation; 

· The mineral resource estimates most recently updated by RSG and MDM in 2006 for the 
A2 Main, A2 East, A2 West deposits 1, 2 and 3 remain current and are in use at the mine; 

· Recent drilling on the Zergore and A2NE deposits has allowed for mineral resource 
interpolations to be completed, and these constitute new resources not considered in 
earlier technical reports; and 

· The Mineral Resources have been classified according to the "CIM Definition Standards 
for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December, 2005)". 

 

For reporting, the authors tabulated the mineral resources within pit shells optimized using a 
gold price of US$1,000 per ounce of gold and other reserve estimation assumptions. 

Mining 

· The Youga mine commenced open pit mining operations in 2008; 
· PW Mining International Ltd is the mining contractor at Youga;  
· The ongoing geotechnical evaluation of the main pit confirms that the stability of the pit 

is acceptable; 
· Based on current ore reserves and mine planning, the Youga LOM Business Plan extends 

from 2011 through to 2015, with a total of 340K ounces of gold being produced during 
this period; and 

· The risks to the Youga Mine LOM plan and operations are currently considered to be 
low, with outcomes being sensitive to negative commercial trends that might develop in 
respect of the gold price and the impact of inflationary effects on power, fuels, labour 
and spare components because of the global economic situation. 

Processing 

· The Youga mine commenced operations in 2008 with CIL processing facilities and 
during the period to end 2010 a total of 193,316 ounces of gold had been recovered

21.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
21.1 OPERATIONS 
 

In 2011 the key objectives of the Youga Gold Mine are: 

· To operate on a "Zero Harm" safety and environmental tolerance basis; 
· To "develop the skills" base of Youga's employees; 
· To continue to "improve productivities and reduce operating costs"; 
· To "exceed LOM budget expectations" year on year; 
· To "extend the life and increase the asset value of the Youga mine" and the company's 

other mineral assets through a process of "development and re-engineering" and the 
addition of additional ore reserves from "exploration" of its land holdings; and 

· To achieve the above objectives in a "socially responsible" manner. 

 

21.2 EXPLORATION AND RESOURCE DELINEATION 
 

A phased follow-up exploration program consisting of several components is recommended on 
the Youga Exploitation Permit.  This program is designed to maximize the opportunity to 
discover new zones of gold mineralization and to expand the potential of the known deposits 
for the minimum exploration expenditures in the shortest time frame.  The total exploration 
budget to complete all of the required work is estimated to be $US5,300,000. 

It is expected that with the accumulation of additional data, priorities among the anomalies will 
change and that in keeping with good exploration practice, the emphasis will be placed on the 
best of the emerging targets. 

The bulk of this expenditure would be allocated to drilling, both RC and diamond-drilling. The 
planned 2011 program includes nearly 28,000 m of RC and in excess of 10,000 m of diamond-
