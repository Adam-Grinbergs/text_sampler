ITEM 1: SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. (CPM) has been investigating the potash mining potential of the Sevier Playa region 

located in the central portion of Millard County in Utah in multiple phases leading to the completion of the 

Feasibility Study (FS) for the Sevier Playa Potash Project (Project). This National Instrument (NI) 43-101 

Feasibility Study Technical Report (Technical Report) summarizes the results of the FS. 

The Project includes the extraction of potassium-bearing brine from the Sevier Playa, targeting production of 

at least 372,030 short tons (337,500 metric tonnes) of sulfate of potash (SOP) per annum. This equates to a 

target flow rate and potassium grade target of approximately 30,000 gpm (6,813.8 m

respectively. The Project will utilize a series of solar evaporation ponds for the precipitation of potassium-

bearing salts, and a Processing Plant for the production of commercial grade SOP. The Mineral Resource 

potential of this area is significant, with the projected Life of Mine (LoM) for the Project being 30 years. 

1.2 Location, Access and Infrastructure 

The property is situated approximately 140 miles (225.3 kilometers) southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, 

between the towns of Delta, Utah (30 miles [48 kilometers] to the northeast) and Milford, Utah (25 miles 

[40.2 kilometers] to the south-southeast). The Playa covers an area of approximately 130,000 acres (52,609 

hectares) and is approximately 26 miles (41.8 kilometers) long by an average of 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) 

wide. 

The main Processing Plant site will be accessed by traveling south from Delta on State Highway 257 for 

approximately 52 miles (83.7 kilometers) and then traveling east for approximately 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) 

on Crystal Peak Road to the Plant site located on the south end of Sevier Lake. 

Climatic conditions are mountainous with an average of 8.03 inches (204 millimeters) of annual precipitation 

(Gwynn, 2006). According to the Western Regional Climate Center, the maximum ambient temperature is 

105°F (40.6°C), and the minimum (non-extreme) is -7°F (-21.7°C). The pan evaporation rate (fresh water) is 

approximately 34.31 in/yr (872.35 mm/yr)

as measured during the field testwork described in Section ‎13.3.1: 

Field Test Programs. 

1.3 History, Legal and Ownership 

Historically, in 1978 a prior developer of Sevier Playa assembled a lease position that encompassed the entire 

surface of the Sevier Playa, including the current Project area. From 1978 to 1990, this company carried out 

significant site development activities, including, but not limited to; drilling, solar evaporation testwork, and 

measurement of climatic conditions.  

After 1990, limited activity was carried out on the Project, until CPM was granted five potash leases from the 

state of Utah, administered by the School and Institutional Trust Land Administration (SITLA) in September 

2008, and completed four wells in the southern portion of the Playa to monitor and confirm brine chemistry. 

CPM was granted 48 federal potassium leases from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) by competitive

bid in April 2011. A separate company, LUMA Minerals LLC (LUMA), was granted 11 federal potassium leases 

from the BLM on the same date, and entered into a Cooperative Development Agreement with CPM on July 

15, 2011. 

From that time, CPM has been actively developing the Project, and completed a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) in 

2013, leading up to the completion of the FS. 

1.4 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact 

Site-specific environmental studies and surveys within the Project area have either been completed, or are in 

the process of being completed, to evaluate the existing environmental conditions in order to assess 

permitting and regulatory requirements and to support permit applications. Surveys and studies that have 

been, or are currently being, completed include the following: 

 Air quality 

 Archeological resources 

 Wildlife habitat, including threatened, endangered, and sensitive species 

 Vegetation, including threatened, endangered, and sensitive species  

 Soils 

 Surface and groundwater 

 Wetlands and waters of the United States 

To date, the surveys have not located or identified any threatened, endangered, or sensitive species of 

wildlife or vegetation. Archeological sites identified will continue to be assessed for significance, and will be 

avoided, mitigated, or managed as appropriate. 

Six water rights applications have been submitted to the Utah Division of Water Rights (UDWRi) and were 

approved by the State Engineer's office on April 30, 2014. The amount of water ranges from 1,000 to 

222,000 ac-ft/yr (1,233,480 to 273,832,560 m
3
/yr) and includes sources such as groundwater, brine water, 

Sevier River and underground wells, and Sevier Lake and ephemeral stream. 

The Project will present opportunities for new jobs in rural Utah and revenue for state, local, and federal 

governments. A Project of this scale represents a substantial economic opportunity for Millard County and 

the towns of Delta and Milford. Coordination with federal, state, and county authorities will continue during 

the next phases of the Project. Environmental studies and surveys within the Project area will be completed 

according to the authorities that have jurisdiction.  

1.5 Site Development 

The location of the main Processing Plant site was selected based upon the potential environmental impact 

and sensitivities, soil conditions, topography, permitting and economic considerations, including distances 

between all areas interconnected by various utilities and infrastructure (e.g., roads, pipelines, power supply 

lines, etc.). Locations were selected for the Fresh Water Production Wells based on hydrologic considerations 

and availability of existing access roads. 

The Processing Plant location was chosen as the grade is relatively level to balance out the cut and fill 

earthworks quantities, and the soil in the area has a reasonable bearing capability that allows for

conventional foundations. The Rail Loadout Facility site will be located to the east of the Processing Plant 

Facility, on the north side of Crystal Peak Road, approximately 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from Highway 257. 

1.6 Geology and Mineralization  

The Sevier Playa is located within the Basin and Range physiographic province, which covers over 10% of the 

continental United States, including all of Nevada and parts of Idaho, eastern Oregon, Utah, Arizona and 

southeastern California. 

The Sevier Playa is an endorheic basin, or terminal hydrologic system, meaning that all surface water within 

the Sevier Playa watershed terminates at the Playa with no exterior drainage from it. Over recent 

(Quaternary) geologic time to present, the accumulation of minerals eroded from the drainage area 

supplying the lake, coupled with persistent desert conditions, has altered the chemistry of the groundwater 

in the unconsolidated lacustrine and alluvial sediments below the Playa surface to that of a mineral-rich 

brine.  

Composition of the thin salt crust covering the Playa consists of evaporite minerals, and is approximately 3 to 

4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 centimeters) thick, ranging up to as much as 18 inches (45.7 centimeters) thick in areas, 

as determined from drilling and augering data. Evaporite minerals that form the crust tend to be zoned on 

the Playa surface, with halite (NaCl) being the dominant mineral in the center of the Playa, followed by 

glauberite (Na2Ca(SO4)2) and then gypsum (CaSO4) near the Playa shore. 

The focus of the Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates presented in this Technical Report are three 

shallow (depths less than 100 feet [30.5 meters]) brine saturated horizons termed the fat clay zone (FCZ), the 

marl clay zone (MCZ), and the siliceous clay zone (SCZ), from top to bottom. Below these horizons is a dry, 

hard clay. 

The deposit type of the Sevier Playa is a terminal lakebed (playa) brine deposit. The brine deposit is 

sedimentary in origin and composed of the natural concentration of mineral salts in groundwater found in 

the Playa. The brine is contained within the unconsolidated Playa sediments, composed primarily of clay and 

marl, a carbonate-rich clay. 

1.7 Exploration  

Exploration, otherwise described as non-drilling related data collection activities, plus the exploration drilling 

programs, consisted of numerous programs and scientific studies that have focused on the Sevier Playa, to 

investigate its climate, sediment and brine characteristics, as well as potential for production of potash and 

related minerals. The activities performed as part of the exploration program include: 

Key exploration activities: 

 Gravity surveys 

 Topography surveys 

 Playa boundary surveys 

 Brine aquifer boundary surveys 

 Hydrologic characterization program 

 Geotechnical characterization program

Key drilling, sampling, and analytical programs conducted: 

 Historic drilling programs 

 Direct push borehole program 

 Mini-sonic borehole program 

 Brine geochemical sampling 

Starting in September 2015, CPM commenced an infill exploration and hydrologically-focused drilling 

program on the BLM and SITLA leases. The primary purpose of the 2015 program was to acquire sufficient 

geologic and hydrologic field data to support a brine-hosted potassium Resource and Reserve estimate in 

accordance with guidelines published by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), 

and with NI 43-101 Technical Report standards, published by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) 

(Canadian Securities Administrators, 2011). A total of 29 vertical holes were completed between September 

10, 2015 and December 5, 2015. Mini-sonic coring methods were used for the 29 holes. A total of 12 of these 

holes were cored into the top of the hard, dry clay zone at the base of the brine-saturated SCZ, approximately 

79 feet (22.9 meters) below ground surface (bgs). 

The new sonic holes were logged in the field by Norwest Corporation (Norwest) geologists. The lithologic 

core descriptions from these field logs, together with moisture content sample results, were used to further 

delineate brine horizon characteristics and the basal surface of the brine Mineral Resource. Brine samples 

were collected from all holes at three different depths in each hole, and core samples from ten of the 2015 

holes were selected for Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) assay. Additionally, four holes were selected for 

semi-quantitative X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis to further characterize the mineralogical constituents of the 

Playa sediments. 

1.8 Mineral Resource Estimate 

The brine Mineral Resource estimate was developed using Carlson
©

 and MineSight® modeling software. The 

geological model from which the brine Mineral Resource are reported is based on the analyses and 

descriptions of brine and aquifer sediment samples taken at regular depth intervals from vertically-oriented 

drill holes collared on the surface of the Playa. The brine Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by 

Norwest's Project Manager, Derek Loveday, P.Geo., Pr. Sci. Nat.; under the supervision of Norwest's Vice 

President Geologic Services, Lawrence Henchel, P.Geo., PG. Mr. Henchel is the Qualified Person (QP) 

responsible for the Mineral Resource estimate. 

Norwest used NI 43-101 disclosure standards, published by the CSA, and addressed the reporting items 

stipulated in Form NI 43-101F1 (Canadian Securities Administrators, 2011) in preparing this Report disclosing 

Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates. Additionally, Norwest considered recommendations put forward in 

the CIM best practice guidelines for lithium (mineral) mineral brines (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy 

and Petroleum, 2012) in the preparation of the estimates. 

The estimated in-place brine Mineral Resources and related major dissolved cations and anions for the FCZ, 

MCZ, and SCZ brine aquifers are totaled and presented in Table ‎1-1. A total Measured plus Indicated in-place 

brine Mineral Resource is estimated to be 6,777 million short tons (6,148 million metric tonnes). A total in-

place Measured plus Indicated potassium (K
+
) Resource is estimated to be 17.09 million short tons (15.51 

million metric tonnes). The estimated in-place Measured plus Indicated mineral equivalent compound of 

potassium sulfate (K2SO4) totals 38.08 million short tons (34.55 million metric tonnes) for the Project. These

tonnages represent the in-place tonnages for the noted compounds and are based on the in-place brine 

Mineral Resource. Mineral equivalent compounds are calculated based on atomic weights of the constituent 

elements and their molecular ratios.

Best practice guidelines adopted by the CIM for the reporting of Mineral Resources from lithium brines 

(Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, 2012) have established the concept of applying 

estimated specific yield values to the in-place brine Mineral Resource quantities, representing what might be 

potentially extractable by gravity drainage. Table ‎1-2 reflects these extractable equivalent compounds for the 

Sevier Playa. The potentially extractable equivalent compounds incorporate specific yield values 

representative of the various lithotypes within the hydrostratigraphic units and report Mineral Resource 

quantities based on the brine tonnages calculated as extractable.  

Measured plus Indicated potentially extractable equivalent K2SO4 Resource from the Measured plus Indicated 

brine is calculated to be approximately 10.5 million short tons (9.538 million metric tonnes). Inferred 

potentially extractable K2SO4 equivalent is estimated at 609,000 short tons (553,000 metric tonnes).

It is important to recognize that the method of applying specific yield to the in-place Mineral Resource does 

not account for the introduction of recharge water contemplated through the mine development process nor 

does it consider the effects of mass transfer. For this reason, the in-place Mineral Resources do not include 

the additional potassium that becomes available through the tonnage produced in the recharge and mass 

transfer processes that are considered a part of the Mineral Reserve.  

The accuracy of Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity of 

available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Given the data available at the 

time this Technical Report was prepared, the estimates presented herein are considered reasonable. 

However, they should be accepted with the understanding that additional data and analysis available 

subsequent to the date of the estimates may necessitate revision. These revisions may be material. There is 

no guarantee that all or any part of the estimated Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves will be recoverable. 

1.9 Hydrogeology 

Norwest and CH2M co-developed the integrated numerical groundwater flow and solute transport model of 

the Sevier Playa. The objectives of the model included: 

 Integrate hydrogeologic information into numerical groundwater flow and solute transport models 

to improve the understanding of the groundwater flow and transport components of the conceptual 

model of the Playa aquifer system. 

 Provide a numerical framework to support developing the brine-extraction components of a 30-year 

LoM plan by forecasting the configuration of trenches and extraction wells, along with the 

sequencing of this infrastructure that may be needed to achieve SOP-production targets. 

 Help inform, along with other site data and professional judgment, estimates of Mineral Reserve. 

 Aid in identifying additional data that, if collected, would help reduce uncertainty in model forecasts. 

The model was calibrated to 2015 pre-mining water levels. The development of the model enabled the 

determination of brine generation and flow properties that then formed the basis of the Mineral Reserve 

estimates. 

1.10 Mineral Reserves Estimate 

The FS has demonstrated that the Project is economically viable. As a result of the favorable economic results 

presented in the FS, in-place Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources have been upgraded to Proven and 

Probable Mineral Reserves. 

The Mineral Reserve estimate has been developed for the Project by CPM's groundwater modeling 

consultant team, Norwest and CH2M Hill (CH2M), who have co-developed integrated numerical groundwater 

flow and solute transport models of the Sevier Playa. These integrated groundwater flow and transport 

models, the Playa Groundwater Flow Model (PGFM) and Playa Solute Transfer Model (PSTM), accommodate 

the specific yield, recharge, and mass transfer processes, and provided a numerical framework to support the 

development of the mine plan and the estimation of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. Norwest's 

Manager, Water Resources, Richard Reinke, P.Geo., is QP for the Mineral Reserve estimate. Table ‎1-3 shows 

the forecast cumulative K2SO4-equivalent mass in units of million short tons and million metric tonnes 

delivered to the pre-concentration ponds over the 30-year LoM.

Novopro Projects Inc. 

The forecast simulations completed as part of the numerical groundwater flow and transport modeling 

exercise indicate that the proposed mine plan, with the noted configuration and modeling assumptions, 

could meet the brine-extraction targets (flow rates and potassium grade targets were approximately 30,000 

gpm [6,813.8 m
3
/h] and 2,240 mg/L respectively), for approximately two-thirds of the 30-year LoM. It is 

anticipated that the brine grade will decline by approximately 5% per year for the remaining simulation 

period. The expected decline has been accounted for in pond and process design and in projected pond and 

process efficiencies by Novopro, and is accounted for in these estimated Available Mineral Reserves of 

potassium. 

There are two categories of Mineral Reserves delineated by this study, these are: 

 Available Mineral Reserves: Mineral Reserves estimated prior to losses due to evaporation pond and 

processing factors; and, 

 Produced Mineral Reserves: net Mineral Reserves estimated, including losses due to evaporation 

pond and processing factors. 

Available Mineral Reserves are defined as the quantities of potassium contained in brine that is technically 

extractable from the Playa and delivered to the first solar evaporation pond.  

The combined Proven and Probable Available Mineral Reserves for the MCZ and SCZ are estimated to be 

0.519 and 2.973 million short tons K
+
 (0.470 and 2.697 million metric tonnes K

+
), respectively. 

K
+
 tonnes produced from the FCZ were assigned to the Probable Available Mineral Reserves category. 

Simulated production in the FCZ is primarily from the initial trench excavation and from some mass transfer 

at the FCZ/MCZ interface.  

Probable Available Mineral Reserves in the FCZ are estimated to be 0.333 million short tons K
+
 (0.302 million 

metric tonnes K
+
). 

Proven and Probable Available Mineral Reserves of K
+
 and equivalent K2SO4 tonnage and brine grade are 

summarized in Table ‎1-3.

Proven and Probable Available Mineral Reserves of potassium together total 3.826 million short tons (3.47 

million metric tonnes). When converted to Available Mineral Reserves of mineral equivalent compounds, the 

combined Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves of K2SO4 total approximately 8.525 million short tons (7.734 

million metric tonnes). 

Norwest used a process recovery factor provided by Novopro Projects Inc. (Novopro) of 79.79% to convert 

from Available Mineral Reserves to Produced Mineral Reserves. The process recovery factor accounts for 

leakage losses, process efficiency, evaporation, and entrainment. Produced Mineral Reserves are estimated 

to be approximately 6.8 million short tons (6.17 million metric tonnes), as shown in Table ‎1-3 above. 

The accuracy of Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity of 

available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Given the data available at the 

time this Technical Report was prepared, the estimates presented herein are considered reasonable. 

However, they should be accepted with the understanding that additional data and analysis available 

subsequent to the date of the estimates may necessitate revision. These revisions may be material. There is 

no guarantee that all or any part of the estimated Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves will be recoverable. 

1.11 Mining Methodology  

The proposed mining method for the collection of naturally occurring brine from the sedimentary basin of 

the Sevier Playa will involve a combination of stepped extraction trenches and drilled wells to collect the 

subsurface brine. The mine design consists of the following major components: 

 Brine extraction system consisting of canals, trenches, and wells 

 Recharge system consisting of canals, collectors, and trenches 

 Series of evaporation ponds 

 Tailing management area (TMA) 



NI 43-101 Technical Report Summarizing the Feasibility Study for the Sevier Playa Potash Project, Millard County, Utah 
Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 9 

Novopro Projects Inc. 

Extraction trenches collect and discharge brine into the extraction canal, which conveys brine to the pre-

concentration ponds. The recharge system introduces fresh water into the MCZ to maintain continuous brine 

extraction over time. The river flow is diverted into a sump that allows the water to enter the east, west, or 

both canals at different flow rates. 

At a minimum, the amount of recharge water required must equal the target Playa brine extraction rate of 

48,339 ac-ft/yr or 29,946 gpm (6,801.5 m
3
/h). Sources of recharge water consist of stream inflow from the 

Sevier River to the Playa, runoff from watersheds surrounding the Playa, precipitation directly onto the 

surface of the Playa, and mountain-block recharge (i.e., subsurface inflow). To support brine extraction, 

purchase‐water agreements of recharge water may also be required. The FS assumes that an average of 

39,028 ac-ft (48,140,257.4 m
3
) of recharge water will be purchased annually over the life of the Project.  

Wells are used to extract brine from the lower SCZ and extend into the overlying lower MCZ.  

The Playa has been divided into Brine Mining Units (BMU). There is a total of 21 BMUs; BMU1 to BMU11, and 

BMU13 to BMU22. Each BMU unit consists of extraction trenches, recharge trenches, recharge collectors, 

and extraction wells. The BMUs are operated to ensure that adequate brine volume and concentration are 

supplied to the pre-concentration ponds 

1.12 Process Development and Design  

A process appropriate for this specific Mineral Resource was developed by Novopro that utilized the ambient 

conditions of the Sevier Playa area. An extensive process development program was initiated for each main 

unit operation in order to demonstrate that the process design was capable of converting the Mineral 

Resource into an SOP product with a viable recovery rate that met the final product specifications. The 

development program consisted of on-site bench scale testing programs that included all the main unit 

operations of the Project: Playa brine extraction, brine evaporation, pond chemistry, salts conversion, 

flotation, final halite removal, muriate of potash (MOP) addition, and SOP crystallization (including reaction 

with MOP).  

METSIM™ and PHREEQC™ modeling software were used to simulate the process and produce mass balances 

of all the process streams involved. Multiple process iterations were run, each with a dedicated model built, 

and convergence of the model verified. The data from the selected model was then used to design the 

testwork methodology and parameters, giving indications of the stream compositions and the required flow 

rates. The data obtained from the testwork was then input back into the software in order to better reflect 

the expected streams for the process. A final model was produced that incorporated the latest testwork 

results, which was then used to generate the mass balance for the process.  

The various unit operations were developed based upon the testwork, leading to the final process design. 

The testwork programs that were developed and executed to confirm the operating parameters of the main 

unit operations of the process included: 

 On-site pan evaporation rate testing 

 On-site pilot evaporation pond chemistry and precipitation of salts 

 Conversion of pond salts 

 Flotation 

 Mineral leach

Novopro Projects Inc. 

 SOP crystallization, including with the addition of MOP 

To increase the level of confidence in the process, and to reduce Project risks, a locked-cycle test of the SOP 

crystallization test with MOP addition was performed. The testwork was conducted at Hazen Research 

(Hazen) with synthetic salts being fed to the flotation circuit. Analytical data indicated that the purity of the 

SOP product was above the required product purity for the Project. The amount of testing performed on the 

individual unit operations, and their success demonstrated the viability of the process.  

1.13 Process Description 

The execution of the Project's processing testwork programs yielded the process design as prepared by 

Novopro. The process starts with potassium-bearing Playa brine being recovered from extraction trenches 

and wells, and then directed to solar pre-concentration ponds to precipitate gangue material. The pre-

concentrated brine is then directed to the harvest ponds where the brine chemistry is controlled and 

potassium-bearing minerals, as well as a quantity of gangue material, are precipitated. In total, 20,447 acres 

(82.8 km
2
) of solar evaporation ponds will be developed for the Project.  

The solids precipitated in the harvest ponds are then harvested and transported to the Processing Plant via 

haul truck. Within the Processing Plant, the salts are crushed, slurried, and pumped so that the salts are 

converted to a single potassium-bearing mineral. This intermediate salt is subsequently upgraded and 

recovered by a flotation circuit while rejecting the gangue material. The potassium-bearing salt generated in 

this step is recovered and directed to the SOP crystallizers. In this unit operation, MOP brine is added 

followed by re-crystallization as K2SO4. Overflow brine from the crystallizer is reused throughout the process. 

The K2SO4 produced is then dried, screened with the respective sized streams directed to either the 

compactor to generate Granular product, loadout as Standard product, or the bagging plant as Water-Soluble 

product. Once ready for distribution, the dry SOP product is loaded into haul trucks for transport to the Rail 

Loadout Facility.  

1.14 Marketing  

Based upon information compiled from public reports, forecasts, studies, and estimates, as well as from 

commissioned market assessments prepared by Parthenon and CRU, CPM is developing a marketing plan for 

domestic and international distribution of potassium sulfate products. The Parthenon research study, titled 

"SOP Market Assessment" (Parthenon Group, 2013) and the CRU research study, titled "SOP Market Study" 

(CRU Consulting, 2017) together serve as the primary research reports. Both reports focus on market 

analysis, supply and demand expectations, pricing trends, and economic forecasting and modeling. 

For the purposes of financial modeling, CPM used a starting SOP price of $572 USD/st ($ 630 USD/mt), based 

on the market research conducted and data collected throughout the FS. This price is inflated within the 

Economic Model on the same basis as all other financial data during the period of operations.

1.15 Logistics 

SOP product will be transported from the Processing Plant along Crystal Peak Road to the Rail Loadout 

Facility located approximately 13 miles (20.9 kilometers) away. Each truck will be equipped with two trailers 

and will be capable of transporting approximately 51 short tons (46.2 metric tonnes) of product per trip. 

Based on a Plant production rate of 42 short tons per hour (STPH) [38.1 metric tonnes per hour (MTPH)], four 

tandem trucks with a total of eight trailers will be required for hauling the product to the Rail Loadout 

Facility. Before travelling back to the Processing Plant, a portion of product transfer trucks will be loaded with 

MOP that is stored at the Rail Loadout Facility for transport to the Processing Plant. 

1.16 Economic Evaluation 

The study produced a Capital Cost estimate including Sustaining Capital to ±15% accuracy, an Operating Cost 

estimate to ±10% accuracy and a de-commissioning cost estimate to ±30% accuracy. The overall study's 

content meets the requirements of the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering (AACE) Class III 

estimate guidelines. 

Development of the AACE Class III ±15% Capital Cost estimates resulted in a total Direct and Indirect CAPEX of 

approximately $390 million USD, including a P50 contingency of $32 million USD. Inflation and escalation 

costs of $14.1 million USD and a Project P50 risk budget of $8.1 million USD resulted in the Project's total 

CAPEX to approximately $412 million USD. 

The AACE Class III ±10% Operating Cost estimate developed as part of the FS established a total annual un-

inflated average operating cost estimate, including risk and contingency, estimated to be $201 USD/st 

($222/mt), FOB Rail Loadout Facility. 

The Deferred and Sustaining Capital Cost estimate over the 30-year LoM is estimated to be a total of 

$222.6 million USD with AACE Class III ±15% precision. The de-commissioning cost estimate is anticipated to 

be a total of $34.0 million USD with ±30% precision. 

The study estimates are summarized in Table ‎1-4 below.

The economic analysis was conducted using a discounted cash flow model (Economic Model). The Economic 

Model was managed by CPM, with input and review conducted by Novopro.

Novopro Projects Inc. 

The Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Net Present Value (NPV), and payback period were calculated based on 

100% equity financing, although it is anticipated that CPM would pursue debt financing alternatives for the 

Project. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the impact of variances in the Project's Capital and 

Operating Costs, revenues, inflation, and discount rate to demonstrate the effects of these variances on 

Project economics.  

For the determination of the LoM, only Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves were used. No Inferred, 

Indicated, or Measured Mineral Resources were utilized in the economic analysis. 

The results of the economic analysis were positive. The nominal NPV, at an 8% discount rate, is $900 million 

USD on a pre-tax basis, and $730 million USD on a post-tax basis. The nominal IRR is 23.0% on a pre-tax basis, 

and 20.8% on a post-tax basis. Based on the free cash flow generated by the Project, the payback period on a 

post-tax basis is estimated to be approximately 4.5 years from first production of saleable product.  

1.17 Risks 

Towards the conclusion of engineering and estimation of the FS, a joint risk review and quantification 

workshop was chaired by Novopro and held on September 7, 2017 in Salt Lake City, Utah. The list of risks 

submitted from all parties was compiled into a master register for assessment during the workshop. At the 

conclusion of the FS Close-Out Risk Review Workshop, a total of 98 risks and opportunities were tabulated. 

A Monte Carlo simulation was performed based on the identified risks resulting in the determination of a P50 

Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) Risk estimate of $8,138,759 USD and P50 Operating Expenditure (OPEX) Risk 

estimate of $3,106,900 USD/yr, both of which have been carried forward in the respective Project cost 

estimates.  

Risk is fairly evenly distributed between construction and operations. The even distribution is due to the on-

going mine expansion related to the Project after the construction phase. 60% of the Project's cost-related 

risks are attributed to the Playa and ponds (i.e., the extraction and recharge trenches and the evaporation 

ponds). According to the risk analysis, approximately 12.5% of the Project risks demonstrate transferability 

(i.e., mitigation of risks by transferring to another party who is better positioned to mitigate that risk). 

1.18 Project Execution Plan  

CPM and Novopro developed a Project Execution Plan. Once expanded during the Bridge Engineering phase 

of the Project, the Project Execution Plan will serve as a preliminary strategy to de-risk the key items 

identified during the FS including risks to Project capital, timelines, contracting and construction.  

The need for a high level of confidence in CAPEX, combined with the nature of the Project, has driven the 

Project Execution plan to split the scope into categories where the contracting strategy will be executed in 

the appropriate manner. At this time, the Project can be split between three main contract types where each 

would be developed depending on their nature and current level of definition.  

 Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) would require the contractor to take 

responsibility for engineering, procurement, and construction, essentially providing a fixed price for 

the installed area. This contract type will be applied to the Rail Loadout Facility and rail line, and the 

electrical supply system.

Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 13 

Novopro Projects Inc. 

 Unit Rate would be based upon a Unit Rate, for cubic feet of earthworks for trenches, pond berms, 

roads, underground services, etc. The contract would be based upon an estimated quantity, with 

formulas for the addition or removal of quantities from the base quantity. This contract type will be 

applied to trench construction, pond construction, and brine transfer pump stations. 

 Engineering, Procurement, Construction, and Management (EPCM): would require the contractor 

to perform the engineering, and to manage the works on behalf of the Owner. This approach, in 

essence, does not provide any price certainty besides the quality of the engineering and the estimate 

that the contractor prepares ahead of the works. This contract type will be applied to the Processing 

Plant, Product Loadout, a portion of utilities supply and infrastructure, and the Fresh Water 

Production Wells. 

1.19 Conclusions of the Feasibility Study 

The conclusions to the FS can be stated as follows: 

 The FS process design succeeded in effectively converting the PFS processing route from a high-

temperature, forced-evaporation route, to a simpler and more energy efficient low-temperature 

route. 

 The ponds and process design change succeeded in reducing the energy demand by 97%, increasing 

production by 13% via the addition of MOP, increasing recovery by 11%, and decreasing pond area 

by 12%.  

 A total Measured plus Indicated in-place brine Mineral Resource is estimated to be 6.777 million 

short tons (6.148 million metric tonnes) from which K
+
 concentrations create a Measured plus 

Indicated in-place potassium Resource of 17.09 million short tons (15.51 million metric tonnes). 

Converting to K2SO4 provides an estimated Measured plus Indicated in-place Mineral equivalent 

Resource totaling 38.08 million short tons (34.55 million metric tonnes) for the Project.  

 Measured plus Indicated potentially extractable equivalent K2SO4 Resource from the Measured plus 

Indicated brine is calculated to be approximately 10.5 million short tons (9.538 million metric 

tonnes), based on the in-place K
+
 Resource. This assumes recovery by specific yield only (Canadian 

Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, 2012). The in-place Mineral Resources do not include 

the additional K
+
 that becomes available through Mineral Reserves produced through the recharge 

and mass transfer processes. 

 The FS has demonstrated that the Project is economically viable. As a result of the favorable 

economic results presented in the FS, in-place Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources have been 

upgraded to Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. 

 Numerical groundwater flow and transport models have been developed that integrate 

hydrogeologic information collected over the last several years to improve the understanding of the 

groundwater flow and transport components of the conceptual model of the Playa aquifer system. 

Only in-place Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources were used in this determination. These 

integrated groundwater flow and transport models accommodate the specific yield, recharge, and 

mass transfer processes, and provided a numerical framework to support the development of the 

mine plan and the estimation of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves.  

 The forecast simulations completed as part of the numerical groundwater flow and transport 

modeling exercise indicate that the proposed mine plan, with the noted configuration and modeling

Novopro Projects Inc. 

assumptions, could meet the brine-extraction targets for approximately two-thirds of the 30-year 

LoM. It is anticipated that the brine grade will decline by approximately 5% per year for the 

remaining simulation period. The expected brine grade decline in the pond feed brine has been 

accounted for in the pond and process design and projected pond and process efficiencies by 

Novopro and is accounted for in these estimated Available Mineral Reserves of potassium.  

 Resultant Proven and Probable K2SO4 Available Mineral Reserves total 8.525 million short tons 

(7.734 million metric tonnes) of K2SO4. Conversion from K
+
 to K2SO4 production is based on a ratio of 

2.2285 (rounded) based on atomic weights. Proven and Probable potassium sulfate Produced 

Mineral Reserves total 6.803 million short tons (6.171 million metric tonnes) of K2SO4. 

 Site-specific environmental studies and surveys within the Project area have either been completed, 

or are in the process of being completed, to evaluate the existing environmental conditions in order 

to assess permitting and regulatory requirements, and to support permit applications. The Project 

will present opportunities for new jobs in rural Utah and revenue for state, local, and federal 

governments. A Project of this scale represents a substantial economic opportunity for Millard 

County and the towns of Delta and Milford. Coordination with the federal, state, and county 

authorities was performed, and will continue during the next phases of the Project. Representatives 

of Millard County have expressed strong support for the Project.  

 Rocky Mountain Power has confirmed that they are able to provide the 18 MW requested for the 

Project, which has a total utility demand load of 14.8 MW. Electrical Consultants Inc. (ECI) has 

performed preliminary engineering and demonstrated the feasibility of routing a 69kV overhead 

power line from the Black Rock Substation to the Processing Plant main substation 

 The aquifer and borehole testing program executed for the Project indicate high-quality 

groundwater is present in the Prospect Mountain Quartzite (PMQ) that can be used to serve site 

process water demands. Hydrologic modeling demonstrates that drawdown is limited to the 

southern Playa Basin, with minimal impact over the LoM to existing fresh water wells used by local 

third parties in the area. 

 Based on the modeled pond mineralogy, bench-scale testwork confirmed the production of on-spec 

SOP product via the planned processing route consisting of crushing, conversion, flotation, leaching 

and SOP crystallization at the nominal combined recovery of 79.79% for the ponds and process. The 

nominal unit grade and recoveries of each unit operation were confirmed by bench-scale testwork, 

which also demonstrated robustness with respect to mineralogical changes in the Plant feed and 

operating temperatures. The process also demonstrated a good degree of seasonal robustness as 

analyzed via the seasonal process sensitivity analysis (a modeling exercise combined with a review of 

climatic data). 

 The Playa brine contains six times the excess sulfate in relation to SOP. MOP addition into the SOP 

crystallizer was demonstrated in the bench scale testwork to provide an SOP production increase of 

50%. 

 Total SOP production over LoM is 10.19 million short tons (9.244 million metric tonnes), with 

6.791 million short tons (6.161 million metric tonnes) from Playa-sourced brine and 3.397 million 

short tons (3.082 million metric tonnes) produced through MOP reaction. 

 The Project's post-tax (nominal) IRR at the FS close was 20.8%. The Project's post-tax (nominal) IRR 

at the FS close was $730 million USD. The economics demonstrated by the Economic Model indicate 

a strong Project with low sensitivity to OPEX and CAPEX. The Project is most sensitive to SOP price. 

The Project is commercially viable and delivers robust project metrics.

Novopro Projects Inc. 

 A Project Execution Plan was developed that proposed utilizing three main contract types, namely; 

EPC, Unit Rate, and EPCM, where each type would be developed depending on their nature, and 

current level of definition. 

 The Owner's team is required to lead the Bridge Engineering and development phases until packages 

are handed over to the respective parties. After this point, the Owner's team's role will be 

overseeing and assisting the contracts/contractors as well as carrying out activities that directly 

require the Owner's direct intervention.  

1.20 Recommendations 

In order to continue to de-risk the Project, maintain Project schedule, and advance the Project in preparation 

for implementation, the execution of a Bridge Engineering phase, field investigations, and additional 

processing testwork is recommended. The following sections outline these recommendations. 

1.20.1 Bridge Engineering 

This phase includes activities involving site investigations, advancing the design of the areas identified to be 

on the critical path, and engaging contractors to provide greater cost certainty for CAPEX and OPEX. The 

Bridge Engineering phase is planned to occur over a period of 12-months, beginning in January 2018 with 

completion in December 2018 for a total estimated cost of approximately $11 million USD, including all 

testwork, field investigations, and contractor/equipment commitments.  

1.20.2 Field Investigations 

Complete several field investigations to further advance the design of the Playa and ponds along with de-

risking specific technical items of the Project. This includes gathering constructability and productivity rates 

to be included in the Project CAPEX, along with continued environmental studies and surveys within the 

Project area according to the authorities that have jurisdiction. 

1.20.3  Process Testwork 

Conduct additional testwork to validate the viability of the process employed by the Project with actual 

Playa-brine-generated salts. The testwork plan focuses on testing all major unit operations. The testwork will 

also provide data and information useful for specifying and selecting the process equipment.  

1.21 Recommendations for the Construction Phase 

The construction of the Playa extraction and recharge trenches will continue throughout the four-year 

construction period. During that time, the Playa will generate a significant amount of real-time data that will 

allow for optimization of the Playa construction work plan. It is recommended that the real-time data be 

utilized during the construction phase to mitigate risk and maintain schedule.

ITEM 4: PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Location 

The Project property is in southwestern Utah, situated in the central portion of Millard County and is defined 

by the geographical boundaries of the Sevier Playa with approximate center at latitude 38°57'59.88" N and 

longitude 113°07'4.33" W, or at 4313105N, 314505E using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) World 

Geodetic System, 1984 (WGS84) coordinates. The general location of the property is illustrated in Figure ‎4-1. 

The property is situated approximately 140 miles (225 kilometers) southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, generally 

between the towns of Delta, Utah (29.83 miles or 48 kilometers to the northeast) and Milford, Utah, 

(24.85 miles or 39.99 kilometers to the south-southeast). The Playa covers an area of approximately 

130,000 acres (52,609 hectares) and is approximately 26 miles (41.84 kilometers) long by an average of 

8 miles (28.96 kilometers) wide. 

The mineral deposits described in this report occur over the entire lakebed of the Sevier Playa and immediate 

shoreline areas. The Playa is dry for most of the year, but portions are occasionally covered with shallow 

meteoric water during certain months. The Playa was originally fed with water from the drainage of the 

Sevier River watershed. Reservoir management and appropriation of Sevier River water for upstream crop 

irrigation normally consumes virtually all the river water before it reaches the Sevier Playa. Episodic climatic 

cycles of above-average precipitation and runoff result in periods of standing water, as occurred in 2011. 

During the summer and fall months when the Playa is in a drier state, it can be traversed by foot or by 

specialized wide-track vehicles. 

4.2 Property Mineral Control 

The leased lands for the Project are predominantly federal lands, administered by the BLM, with isolated 

Public Land Survey System (PLSS) grid sections approximately 640 acres (259 hectares) in size belonging to 

the state of Utah, and managed by SITLA.  

The leases are controlled by the following three entities: 

 Peak Minerals Inc. (Peak Minerals) 

 Emerald Peak Minerals, LLC (Emerald Peak) 

 LUMA  

A small amount of land along the outer margins of the Playa that is desirable for mining operations has not 

been leased, but it can be leased once the Project is an ongoing mining operation. Figure ‎4-2 shows the 

location of the various mineral tenure areas. 

Table ‎4-1 summarizes the relationship of the entities that control the potash leases involved with the Project. 

CPM controls, has financial investments in, or has entered into agreements with each of the entities.

These investments and agreements provide for operational control of the leases by CPM, as described below 

and presented in Table ‎4-2 through Table ‎4-4: 

 BLM potassium leases issued to Peak Minerals: On June 1, 2011, Peak Minerals leased federal 

potassium leases covering 95,801.76 acres (38,769.66 hectares) of land on the Sevier Playa by 

competitive bid from BLM. Peak Minerals is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary and the United States 

operating company for CPM. 

 SITLA potash leases issued to Emerald Peak: On September 2, 2008, Emerald Peak leased state of 

Utah potassium leases covering 6,409.48 acres (2,593.83 hectares) of land on the Sevier Playa by 

competitive bid from SITLA. Peak Minerals owns a 40% membership interest in Emerald Peak and has 

a Commercial Services Agreement that grants Peak Minerals development and operational rights on 

these lands. 

 BLM potassium leases issued to LUMA: On June 1, 2011, LUMA leased federal potassium leases 

covering 22,011.79 acres (8,907.03 hectares) of land on the Sevier Playa by competitive bid from 

BLM. Peak Minerals has a Cooperative Development Agreement, dated July 15, 2011, with LUMA 

that provides Peak Minerals with development and operational control of LUMA's federal potassium 

leases on becoming an operating entity. CPM executed a 12-month extension of the LUMA 

agreement on June 27, 2012, effective as of June 15, 2012. CPM executed a second 12-month 

extension of the LUMA agreement on June 5, 2013, effective June 15, 2013, thereby extending its 

term to June 15, 2014. CPM has since executed four additional annual extensions, the latest 

becoming effective on June 15, 2017, and extending the term of the agreement until June 15, 2018. 

Peak Minerals and LUMA entered into the Cooperative Development Agreement on July 15, 2011. The 

agreement is intended to develop the joint leases as a combined property, similar to the way an oil and gas 

field can be unitized between several different leaseholders. The agreement establishes the goal of working 

to create this unit with the regulating federal and state agencies. While there has been no decision by the 



NI 43-101 Technical Report Summarizing the Feasibility Study for the Sevier Playa Potash Project, Millard County, Utah 
Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 34 

Novopro Projects Inc. 

agencies formally creating a Unit Agreement, it is likely to be successfully adopted given that BLM was the 

originator of the unitized approach to the liquid mineral commodity and it is supported by BLM, SITLA, 

Emerald Peak, CPM, and LUMA.

With the support of BLM, SITLA, Emerald Peak, and LUMA, Peak Minerals intends to unitize the leases and 

operate and develop them under a Unit Agreement designed to, among other things, obligate the lessors and 

the lessees to a development and production allocation arrangement that would grant Peak Minerals sole 

rights to develop and operate the potassium and other associated Mineral Resources on the Sevier Playa. 

Work has begun on this agreement, and CPM anticipates that an executed Unit Agreement will be in place in 

2018.

Currently, Peak Minerals owns a 100% leasehold interest in federal potassium leases comprising 95,801.76 

acres (38,769.66 hectares). The leases grant full rights of access and rights to use the surface for leasehold 

mining activities. The terms of the leases are 20 years from the date of issuance (June 1, 2011) and 

thereafter, as long as Peak Minerals complies with certain rental, minimum royalty, and other terms and 

conditions of the leases. Minimum production and minimum royalty requirements commenced in the sixth 

lease year. The leases are subject to readjustment at the end of each 20-year term. 

The same terms described previously also apply to the federal potassium leases in which record title is held 

by LUMA. Peak Minerals will have development and operational control of these leases under the terms of its 

Cooperative Development Agreement dated July 15, 2011, but extended through June 15, 2018; and under a 

Unit Agreement or similar agreement, and an Operating Agreement that will be entered into by Peak 

Minerals, LUMA, and Emerald Peak. 

The state of Utah potash leases are owned 100% by Emerald Peak. They grant full rights of access and rights 

to utilize the surface and subsurface for uses "reasonably incident to the mining of leased substances." The 

terms for all of the leases are for 10 years from the effective date of September 8, 2008, and for so long 

thereafter as leased substances are being produced in paying quantities; or if CPM is engaged in diligent 

operations, exploration, or development activity, as well as making a substantial financial investment. Peak 

Minerals owns 40% of the membership interest in Emerald Peak and also has the contractual commitment 

from Emerald Peak to enter into a Unit Agreement or similar agreement, as well as an Operating Agreement. 

These agreements will name Peak Minerals as operator and give Peak Minerals the sole right to develop and 

operate the SITLA leases along with the BLM leases. The Emerald Peak agreement commits Peak Minerals to 

pay Emerald Peak the greater of $40,000 USD/yr or a 7.5% overriding royalty on all potash production 

allocated to the SITLA leases. 

The LUMA potassium leases are subject to the same federal royalty rates as the Peak Minerals federal 

potassium leases. The LUMA agreement also commits Peak Minerals to pay LUMA a 1.25% overriding royalty 

on all production from, or allocated to, the LUMA leases. This agreement also grants LUMA the right, in 

addition to the overriding royalty, to elect either (1) a cash-only payment of $2 million USD, or (2) the 

number of shares in CPM equal in value to $1 million USD, plus $1 million USD cash at closing. The closing is 

conditioned on and subject to (1) all necessary approvals of Peak Minerals and/or CPM's shareholders and 

Board; (2) all necessary approvals of United States and Canadian governmental authorities, including but not 

limited to those of securities and exchange and environmental regulatory bodies, BLM, and SITLA; and (3) all 

applicable stock exchange rules, regulations, and approvals.  

The authors have reviewed the BLM and SITLA mineral lease documents and find that they appear valid and 

reasonable for the operation of potash extraction within lease boundaries. No formal legal review or further 

due diligence has been performed. 

4.2.1 Property with Bureau of Land Management Leases 

Potash is defined by regulation under Code of Federal Regulations (43 CFR 3500) and The Mineral Leasing Act 

of 1920 as a solid "leasable" mineral. BLM issues leases in two different ways for solid leasable minerals, 

other than coal and oil shale – competitive issues in areas where there is a mineral deposit and competitive 

leases through a bidding process.

Through Peak Minerals, CPM was awarded its leases under the competitive bidding process. A review of the 

lease documents determined that the following rents, royalties, and stipulations apply to the Peak 

Minerals leases: 

 Production royalty on gross value of potassium and other associated mineral compounds free on 

board (FOB) to market 

o Lease Years 1 through 5 = 2.0% 

o Lease Years 6 through 20 = 5.0% 

 Minimum production/minimum royalty 

o Minimum royalty = $3.00 USD per 1 acre (0.405 hectare) beginning in Year 6 

o If minimum production royalties do not exceed requirements in Year 6, the minimum royalty is 

paid 

 Rental and royalty 

o Lease Year 1 = $0.25 USD per 1 acre (0.405 hectare) (or fraction thereof) 

o Lease Years 2 through 5 = $0.50 USD per 1 acre (0.405 hectare) (or fraction thereof) 

o Lease Years 6 through 20 = $1.00 USD per 1 acre (0.405 hectare) (or fraction thereof) 

 Lease term 

o Perpetuity, provided lessee complies with terms and conditions of lease. 

o Terms and conditions of lease renegotiated every 20 years. 

 Diligence requirements 

o Cancellation of lease pursued at end of 20-year lease term if potassium compounds are not 

being produced in paying quantities. 

The leases stipulate that the greater amount between rent and royalty is to be paid. Other stipulations 

carried by the leases were reviewed and found to be standard regulations pertaining to protection of the 

environment and human health, property reclamation, and reporting requirements. BLM requires that an 

exploration plan and environmental assessment (EA) be submitted prior to the commencement of any 

exploration activities, as well as an approved Notice of Intent (NOI) from the Utah's Division of Oil, Gas and 

Mining (DOGM). Mining operations on the lease will require an approved Plan of Operations from BLM and a 

mining permit approval from DOGM. 

4.2.2 Property with Utah State Mineral Leases 

The Utah State mineral leases managed by SITLA are owned 100% by Emerald Peak and are effective for 10-

year terms from the effective date of September 8, 2008, and for so long thereafter as leased substances are 

being produced in paying quantities. Annual maintenance fees are $4.00 USD per 1 acre (0.405 hectare). 

State royalties payable to SITLA are 5% gross value FOB the mine. The leases held by Emerald Peak stipulate 

that mineral production must commence by September 1, 2018.

4.2.3 Property Environmental Liabilities 

An EA of the leaseholds was conducted in 1987 by BLM. The CPM development and operational plans were 

reviewed and the leasehold area surveyed for such environmental concerns as wildlife habitat, threatened 

and endangered species, cultural/archaeological resources, and impact to recreational opportunities. A 

Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was issued in October 1987; the result being that the Project would 

not require an EIS to proceed. 

Recently, the area has undergone two EAs conducted by BLM. The first was performed prior to the lease sale 

in 2011 to determine the potential impacts from leasing the minerals for development. No significant impacts 

were identified, and the leases were offered for bid. As a follow up to the leasing EA, BLM completed a 

second EA to assess the impacts of exploration drilling. Again, no significant impacts were identified, and the 

exploration program was successfully initiated and completed. No known encumbrances or environmental 

liabilities are associated with the property at the time of this Technical Report.

ITEM 5: ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Property Access 

Major airline access to the property is via the Salt Lake City International Airport. Daily commuter flights are 

available to Cedar City, Utah, approximately 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) to the south of the town of Milford. 

Access by vehicle from Salt Lake City is south via Interstate 15 for approximately 85 miles (136.0 kilometers) 

to the town of Nephi, Utah, then via State Route (SR) 132 for approximately 85 miles (136.0 kilometers) to 

the town of Lynndyl, Utah, then following United States Highway 6 to the city of Delta. The northern margin 

of the Playa is accessed by traveling southwest approximately another 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) along 

United States Highway 6. 

The southern end of the Project can be accessed by traveling north from Cedar City, Utah, on SR 130 and 

then SR 21 for approximately 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) to the town of Milford. North from Milford, SR 257 

travels a distance of approximately 23 miles (37.0 kilometers) to the Black Rock railroad siding of the Union 

Pacific Railroad (UPRR). The southern end of the property is accessed by traveling west from Black Rock on 

secondary improved gravel roads for approximately an additional 13 miles (20.9 kilometers) to the Playa. 

Two secondary north-south-trending improved gravel roads run along the west and east sides of the 

property. On the west, Steamboat Pass Road is a graded, native surface (dirt) Class B county-maintained 

road. On the east of the Playa, Headlight Canyon Road is a rough, two-track native surface (dirt) road that 

runs from SR 257 Cutoff Road to Crystal Peak Road. Numerous unimproved roads and trails, suitable for four-

wheel drive vehicles, lead from these north-south-trending routes to the edge of the Playa. The ability to 

travel on the Playa varies seasonally depending on the amount of moisture on the saltpan. The margins of the 

Playa can support a pickup truck in places, but use of normal vehicles is risky due to their weight and the 

likelihood of becoming mired in the relatively soft Playa sediments. Playa travel is best approached with all-

terrain or tracked vehicles and has been creatively addressed by the use of snow cats with extra-wide treads. 

Recent exploration activities, being performed during a period of unusually wet playa conditions, used marsh 

buggies commonly employed in the bayous of the southern United States as rig platforms, as well as air-

propelled boats for personnel and equipment transport. 

5.2 Climate 

The Project area is semi-arid with 8.03 inches (204 millimeters) of annual precipitation (Gwynn, 2006). 

Vegetation consists of low brush and sage on the margins of the Sevier Playa, while the Playa surface itself is 

devoid of vegetation due to periodic flooding and the resulting formation of a salt crust on the surface from 

the evaporation of the mineral brine. 

Regional climate statistics from nearby towns and weather stations show an average maximum temperature 

of 66.4°F (19°C), ranging between a high in July of 93.0°F (33.9°C) and a low in January of 40.2°F (4.6°C). 

Minimum temperatures averaged 33.5°F (0.8°C), ranging between a high in July of 55.9°F (13.3°C) and a low 

in January of 13.8°F (-10.1°C).  

According to the Western Regional Climate Center, extremes range from the maximum ambient temperature 

of 105°F (40.6°C), to the minimum (non-extreme) is -7°F (-21.7°C). The annual evaporation rate (fresh water) 

is 0.094 in/d (2.39 mm/d)
 
as measured during the field testwork described in Section ‎13.3.1: Field Test 

Programs.

Novopro Projects Inc. 

The climate of the Project area is important in that proposed harvesting of the brine minerals is through the 

use of large-scale, shallow solar evaporation impoundments. The ideal conditions for this type of process 

occur in an area that is arid, relatively hot, and windy. The early developers of the Project established two 

weather stations that recorded climatic conditions at the Playa for a period during the late 1970s. Data from 

the period of late June through early September 1979 (Gwynn, 2006) showed daytime temperatures to 

average approximately 86°F (30°C) and night-time temperatures approximately 54°F (12.2°C). Wind speeds 

recorded during spring through fall averaged 15 to 20 mph (24 to 32 km/h). In 2017, six Class A standard 

evaporation pans were installed on the Sevier playa for empirical measurement of the site-specific fresh 

water and brine solar evaporation rates. Over the evaporation period from April to October 2017, 

evaporation measurements were taken twice weekly as part of the solar ponds design of the Sevier project. 

Exploration activities can be conducted year-round, as proven by the 2011/2012 program, which conducted 

drilling activities from November through April on federal Leases. Potential mining operations will likely face 

climatic challenges related to decreased solar evaporation during winter months; however, it is envisioned 

that management of multiple pond systems at varying stages of development would provide sufficient feed 

stockpiles to maintain operations throughout the year. 

5.3 Local Resources 

The nearby towns of Delta and Milford are small material supply centers and sources of local labor. Milford's 

population in the 2010 census was 1,357 and Delta's population was 3,509. Both towns are on the UPRR line 

connecting Salt Lake City, Utah, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Milford has UPRR facilities for its workers, since it is 

the halfway point between the two major cities. The proximity of the railroad and the Black Rock siding is 

attractive from a market access standpoint. 

Labor would likely be recruited both locally and from throughout Utah and the Rocky Mountain west. The 

southwest Utah region has a history of mining for precious and base metals, alunite, and uranium, and likely 

would be a source for both skilled and unskilled labor. The operations producing both potash and halite from 

brine at the Great Salt Lake as well as Intrepid Potash Inc.'s (Intrepid's) Wendover, Nevada, facility suggest 

the ready availability of personnel skilled in the crystallization, harvesting, and processing aspects of brine 

mineral production. 

5.4 Infrastructure 

The property has undergone a limited amount of development with no known mining or commercial mineral 

harvesting having taken place to date. Largely in an undisturbed natural state, the property had no 

permanent dwellings or structures until CPM recently constructed a warehouse and storage area near the 

southern end of the Playa. Two completed operational water supply wells, managed by BLM for stock use, 

are located just off the Playa with small storage tanks at the wellheads. The road connecting the southern 

portion of the Playa to SR 257 has been upgraded with road base in anticipation of the future siting of a 

minerals Processing Plant in that area. Figure ‎5-1 shows the local infrastructure surrounding the Project with 

topography and satellite image, respectively. 

Development work within the Playa is limited to the excavation of a 4.8-mile (7.72-kilometer) long brine 

collection canal in the late 1980s, which was dug into the lakebed sediments approximately 20 feet (6.10 

meters) deep, and bermed along the edges several feet above the Playa surface, as well as several 

evaporation ponds that were to be fed by the canal via a series of feeder dikes. The canal, ponds, and feeder

Novopro Projects Inc. 

dikes remain in place in the south-central margin of the Playa, although the canal has been largely silted-in 

since brine collection and evaporation ceased in 1993. 

Infrastructure components such as electric power and the minerals Processing Plant siting are discussed in 

detail in ‎Item 18: Project Infrastructure. To summarize, access routes to power sources suitable for a 

commercial processing operation have been determined and negotiations for take-off have commenced with 

the local power company. Plant siting has been located at the southern end of the Playa due to its proximity 

to road and rail transportation. The relatively flat valley-bottom south of the Playa provides sufficient area for 

facilities, waste, and product storage. 

The Sevier Playa area has no perennial streams and water that collects on the Playa comes from precipitation 

and the Sevier River. Water to support the processing of minerals crystallized from the brine would have to 

be sourced from groundwater. CPM has obtained sufficient groundwater rights from the State Engineer's 

office.

Three types of tailings are anticipated to be generated by the evaporation ponds and processing facility: 

 Type 1: tailing salts generated in the pre-concentration ponds. Type 1 tailing salts would be stored in 

the pre-concentration ponds, and the berms would be continuously raised over the LOM to increase 

storage capacity. 

 Type 2: purge brine would be removed pre-harvest from the final evaporation pond stage. Type 2 

tailings would be pumped from the final production ponds to the waste product storage facility's 

purge brine storage ponds, located on the Playa, west of the production ponds. 

 Type 3: tailings generated from the Processing Facility would be solid salt tailings removed during the 

filtration and scrubbing steps of the process. Type 3 tailings would be trucked, as a filtered solids 

material, from the processing facility flotation circuit to the waste product storage facility's tailings 

storage facility. 

5.5 Physiography 

The property encompasses the Sevier Playa. The Playa is in western Utah's Sevier Desert, in a broad valley, 

10 to 15 miles (16 to 24 kilometers) wide. The Playa is bounded on the east by the Cricket Mountains and on 

the west by the Black Hills portion of the House Range. The San Francisco Mountains lie to the south of the 

Playa and the Wah Wah Mountains to the southwest, with the Wah Wah Valley between them. The dry Wah 

Wah Playa is located within the Wah Wah Valley and is 5 miles (8.1 kilometers) south of Sevier Playa with 

similar physiographic conditions. To the north of Sevier Playa is the gently south-sloping surface of the Sevier 

Desert. The Playa covers an area of approximately 130,000 acres (59,609 hectares), at an altitude of 

approximately 4,514 feet (1,376 meters) above mean sea level (AMSL). The mountains east and west of the 

Sevier Playa are at an altitude of generally above 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) AMSL. 

The Sevier River is the main source of water that flows into the terminal Sevier Playa. Inflow from the Sevier 

River is unpredictable during most years because of reservoir storage and the heavy demand for irrigation 

water upstream. Satellite imagery acquired from August 1999 through August 2002 (Gwynn, 2006) indicates 

water, likely the result of local meteoric conditions, to be on the surface of Sevier Playa typically during 

November through April, though probably amounting to only several inches in depth. During the remainder 

of the year (May through October), the majority of the Playa's surface appears to be dry. 

According to Gwynn (Gwynn, 2006), water of abnormal depth was probably present on the Playa from 1913 

to 1915 and from 1922 to 1923. Additionally, during the period from 1983 through 1985, the Sevier Playa 

filled with water due to the above-average inflow from the Sevier River. At its peak, the depth of surface 

water was nearly 13 feet (4 meters) above the Playa, as reported by Larry Sower of Crystal Peak Minerals 

Corporation (CPMC)(Gwynn, 2006). From 1986 through 1988, inflow to the Playa was reduced significantly 

and the depth of the water declined. 

Record snowfall and precipitation through the winter and spring of 2011 caused unusually high-water levels 

in the numerous reservoirs along the course of the Sevier River. Consequently, water management 

authorities found it necessary to release retained water during the fall and early winter of 2011 rather than in 

the spring when it is used for irrigation and consumed before reaching the Playa. The exploration activities 

conducted from November 2011 to April 2012 had to deal with surface water ranging from 1 to 2 feet (0.30 

to 0.60 meters) in depth.

ITEM 6: HISTORY 

As early as the late 1800s, various topographic surveys were conducted in the Sevier Playa region. In 1869, 

the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) led by First Lieutenant, George M. Wheeler, determined 

the true position of the Playa(Gwynn, 2006). Between 1869 and 1977, most mapping work in the region 

focused on improving topographical and surface geology information with scientific studies undertaken in the 

1960s for the purpose of assessing Playa mineralogy and brine chemistry. These studies served as the basis 

for more detailed exploration and bulk sampling by CPMC that started in 1977. 

6.1 CPMC Ownership 

CPMC assembled a 133,000-acre (53,823-hectare) lease position that encompassed the entire surface of the 

Sevier Playa, including the current Project area. In 1978, four holes were drilled by CPMC to depths ranging 

from 705 to 975 feet (214 to 297 meters) to test the chemical composition of the deep sediments and brine. 

During the period of 1979 to 1983, over 700, 20-foot (6.1-meter) deep auger wells were completed by CPMC 

throughout the Playa to test the composition of the brine and sediments, thickness of salt crust, and to 

characterize the mineralogy and brine content of the lakebed sediments. A deep brine test well was installed 

in 1988 to evaluate the brine composition near the 200-foot (60.1-meter) depth level. 

Weather stations were established to measure climatic conditions, and Class A evaporation pans were 

erected to determine fresh water evaporation rates. Small-scale evaporation ponds were constructed on the 

floor of the Playa to determine brine evaporation rates and to study the phase chemistry of evaporating 

brine and precipitated salts. The flooding of the Sevier Playa between 1983 and 1988 proved a major setback 

to the Project as up to 13 feet (4 meters) of water covered the Playa surface, destroying the weather stations 

and some of the experimental ponds, and delaying work on the Project. 

After this period of flooding, CPMC resumed its work on the Playa. A 3.5-mile (5.63-kilometer) long protective 

dike, separating the Playa into a north half and a south half, was designed but never constructed. This dike 

would have been located at Needle Point. Interior dikes for 3,000-acre (1,214-hectare) solar evaporation 

pond systems were constructed; a north trending, 4.8-mile (7.72-kilometer) long brine collection canal was 

dredged, and roads and a campsite were constructed. The solar evaporation pond system was completed in 

1987 and it was reported that more than 1 million short tons (907,185 metric tonnes) of salt was precipitated 

from the brine to create permanent salt floors in the ponds of sufficient thickness to support heavy salt-

harvesting equipment. Salt and high-magnesium chloride brine were produced in 1989 and 1990, and test 

ponds operated to produce low-grade potash salts. In addition, engineering designs for salt washing, drying, 

bagging, and load-out facilities were completed, and CPMC developed a flow sheet for the future production 

of SOP. 

The demise of the Project came with the death of Mr. W.D. Haden, the Project's financier. On Mr. Haden's 

death, funding for the Project was terminated. In May 1993, representatives of CPMC filed the 

"Relinquishments on Federal Potassium Leases" papers. CPMC performed the required reclamation work, 

after which the Sevier Playa Project was abandoned.

6.2 CPMC Tonnage Estimates 

Godbe (1984), representing CPMC, estimated the potential tonnages of halite, salt cake, potash, and bitterns 

that could be produced from salts resulting from solar evaporation of brine collected from the first 20 feet 

(6.1 meters) of sediment below the Sevier Playa surface. CPMC estimated the theoretical tonnages of 

precipitated potassium, magnesium, sodium, chloride and sulfate from the average brine chemistries and 

then used the molecular mass of these ions to calculate tonnages. The following potential products were 

estimated from these ions: 

 Halite (NaCl) 

 Salt cake (Na2SO4) 

 Potash (KCl or K2SO4) 

 Bitterns (MgCl2, MgSO4) 

The average brine chemistries used for the tonnage estimates appear to be derived from analyses of brine 

samples collected from CPMC drill holes and the brine collection canal. Given that the data available at the 

time of this report are from unverifiable historical documents, lack documentation of sampling or laboratory 

methods, and were reported prior to current industry and security exchange guidelines being established, 

these estimates are considered historical and should not be used as current Mineral Resource or Reserve 

estimates. The historical tonnage estimates provided by Godbe (1984) should be viewed as providing a 

theoretical basis for the potential to produce potash and/or other salt products from the Sevier Playa. 

Although the past work was significant, CPM intentionally did not pursue a validation of historical data, but 

moved forward with a plan to define a current Mineral Resource using new drilling and sampling data under 

current standards. 

The leases controlled by CPMC nearly covered the entire Sevier Playa, and Godbe's (1984) tonnage estimates 

for the first 20 feet (6.1 meters) of the Playa best illustrate the entire Playa's potential to produce a range of 

salt products from the brine. Godbe's product tonnage estimates are based on the assumptions outlined in 

Table ‎6-1 and the tonnage estimates are listed in Table ‎6-2. 

Based on the available data that have been reviewed, the assumptions used by CPMC appear to be 

conservative, with the exception of the 140,000-acre (56,656-hectare) areal estimate, which is slightly larger 

than the Playa surface area of 130,000 acres (52,609 hectares). The additional 10,000 acres (4,047 hectares) 

are most likely the lateral area of the Playa between the low and high-water marks. The percent intra-

formational brine (25%) used in Godbe's calculations is less than the water saturation levels determined from 

CPMC auger samples, which suggest an average saturation level of 30%. Additionally, the brine density of 

64 lb/ft
3
 (1025.2 kg/m

3
) is less than an average of approximately 68.7 lb/ft

3
 (1100.5 kg/m

) calculated from 

brine sample data.

Differences in total tonnages for the ions and products are most likely associated with rounding errors in the 

calculations and are viewed as materially insignificant. Theoretical tonnage estimates of MOP can be replaced 

by SOP on a 1:1 ratio (Godbe, 1984). 

6.3 Salada Ownership 

Salada Minerals, LLC (Salada) assembled 15,360 acres (6,216 hectares) of federal sodium leases in 1997 

covering only the south end of the Playa. Salada also held 1,280 acres (518 hectares) in five separate sections 

of state potassium leases. Development of Salada's leaseholds also went through the EA process, culminating 

in a FONSI by BLM issued in June 1997. Historical records of the Salada project are significantly less than that 

of CPMC.

Novopro Projects Inc. 

Despite the lack of documentation, it is apparent that Salada's lease holdings were relinquished, and it is 

believed that Salada did not perform any exploration or mining activities. However, both CPMC and Salada 

did estimate potential tonnages of halite and potash, as well as other product mineral assemblages that 

could be produced from Sevier Playa brine. 

6.4 Salada Tonnage Estimates  

Salada's lease areas included only southern portions of the Sevier Playa (i.e., the area south of Needle Point). 

Rasmussen (1997), representing Salada, estimated product tonnage based on the assumptions outlined in 

Table ‎6-3 and recorded estimates derived from these assumptions are listed in Table ‎6-4. 

The assumptions used by Salada for intraformational brine ratio and density appear to be closer to the values 

determined from current sampling than the CPMC estimates. The average brine chemistries are roughly 

within expected ranges based on current brine chemical analyses as presented in Section ‎11.4.2: Brine 

Geochemical Analysis. Potassium values are comparatively high and may reflect sampling bias, both in areal 

and depth parameters. Differences in total tonnages for the ions and products are most likely associated with 

rounding errors in the calculations and are viewed as materially insignificant.

Both the CPMC and Salada tonnage estimates are not consistent with the current standards for the reporting 

of Mineral Resources and are presented for historical perspective of product tonnage estimates of the first 

20 feet (6.1 meters) below the Playa surface only. CPM is not treating these as current Mineral Resource 

estimates. A QP has not performed sufficient work to classify these estimates as current Mineral Resources 

or Mineral Reserves. 

6.5 CPM Ownership 

A change in company name occurred in June 2015, and changed from Emerald Peak Minerals Mining 

Ventures Inc. (EPM) to CPM. The following discussion uses CPM as the default company name throughout. 

Emerald Peak was granted five potash leases from SITLA in September 2008 and completed four wells in the 

southern portion of the Playa to monitor and confirm brine chemistry. Peak Minerals was granted 48 federal 

potassium leases from the BLM by competitive bid in April 2011. LUMA was granted 11 federal potassium 

leases on the same date from the BLM and entered into a Cooperative Development Agreement with Peak 

Minerals on June 1, 2011. 

CPM initiated an exploration and brine sampling program consisting of 21 holes on the SITLA leases during 

the month of August 2011. Following a lengthier federal permitting process, a full-scale program of 

exploration, brine and sediment sampling, and hydrologic well installation and testing was initiated in 

November 2011 on Peak Minerals' federal leases. The 2011/2012 drilling operations were completed in 

April 2012, followed by hydrologic data collection and analysis. Additional drilling during February and 

March 2013 provided data within the LUMA lease areas and infill on the state and other federal leaseholds. 

Further drilling and sampling of the brine and the Playa sediments were undertaken during the period from 

September to December 2015. The program included hydrologic testing of wells, trenches, and test pits that

extended into the spring of 2016. The purpose of the 2015/2016 program was to provide additional technical 

data for estimating feasibility-level brine Mineral Reserves and associated quantities of salt products.  

The CPM Project FS is a culmination of the exploration and development work conducted by CPM since 

August 2011 and documents activities, results, and conclusions from the exploration drilling, sampling, 

trenching and test pit evaluations. Current brine Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates are presented, as 

well as hydrologic characterization, mining and processing studies, and economic analysis. 

No known commercial extraction has occurred on the property. As previously stated, CPMC performed some 

limited test production, but not on a commercial scale. 

6.6 CPM Tonnage Estimates 

A Mineral Resource estimate in accordance with NI 43-101 standards has been performed for CPM and 

reported in three prior technical reports. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the past or current 

estimated Mineral Resources would be recoverable. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not 

have demonstrated economic viability. 

The first estimate was based on the results of 2011/2012 drilling performed by CPM and had an effective 

date of May 1, 2012. The initial report was produced for CPM by Norwest and was dated May 31, 2012 

(Norwest Corporation, 2012). Subsequently, the same Mineral Resources were used as the basis of a 

Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) commissioned by CPM from March Consulting Associates, Inc. of 

Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, released on (and with an effective date of) November 16, 2012 (March 

Consulting Associates Inc., 2012). The effective date of the Mineral Resource estimate delineated in the PEA 

remained May 1, 2012. 

The May 1, 2012 Mineral Resource estimate projected a total in-place Measured plus Indicated Mineral 

Resource consisting of the following dissolved cations and anions calculated from the brine Mineral Resource 

by wt% (Table ‎6-5).

These two estimates also reported an in-place Inferred potassium Resource of 4.43 million short tons 

(4.02 million metric tonnes); with an equivalent Inferred potash compound equivalent of 9.87 million short 

tons (8.95 million metric tonnes). Mineral Resources reported through the PEA report included only drilling 

and sampling results derived from the 2011/2012 programs.  

The second estimate was based on results of 2013 drilling performed by CPM, and had an effective date of 

October 25, 2013. The Mineral Resources were used as the basis of a PFS commissioned by CPM and released 

on November 18, 2013.  

CH2M, operating as prime consultant for the 2013 PFS, released the supporting Technical Report for the 

study on November 18, 2013 (CH2M Hill, 2013). The updated Mineral Resource estimate presented in the 

Technical Report included all drilling and sampling results through March 2013 and had an effective date of 

October 25, 2013. The PFS in-place Mineral Resource estimate is shown in Table ‎6-7, which presents brine 

and primary dissolved cations and anions calculated from the brine Mineral Resource by wt%.

ITEM 7: GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

The Sevier Playa is located within the Basin and Range physiographic province. The Basin and Range 

physiographic province covers over 10% of the continental United States, including all of Nevada and parts of 

Idaho, eastern Oregon, Utah, Arizona, and southeastern California. Formation of the Basin and Range 

province began during the Miocene Period, approximately 24 to 25 million years ago, during regional uplift of 

a sizeable portion of the western United States In this formative period, the east-west extension of the 

continental crust resulted in uplifted north-south trending mountains (horsts) and intervening, down-

dropped valley platforms (grabens), bounded by normal faults. Subsequent erosion of the flanking mountains 

led to sediment-filled valleys within the grabens. It is in one of these north-south-trending, sediment-filled 

valleys where the Sevier Lake endorheic, or terminal Playa was formed. 

7.1 Sedimentation and Geologic Setting 

The subsequent Pleistocene Period was characterized by the deposition of lacustrine shore deposits from 

Lake Bonneville along the high-lying areas surrounding what is now the Sevier Playa. As Lake Bonneville 

receded from its maximum extent from southern Idaho to southwestern Utah, a fresh water lake (Lake 

Gunnison) remained in the Sevier Desert Basin. Lake Gunnison emptied into the Great Salt Lake to the north 

through the Old River Bed north of the Sevier River (Rasmussen, 1997). Further decline in the Lake Gunnison 

water levels ended, with the present-day isolation of the Great Salt Lake in the north and Sevier Lake in the 

south. 

The Sevier Playa is an endorheic hydrologic system, meaning that all surface water within the Sevier Playa 

watersheds terminate at the Playa, with no exterior drainage from it. Over recent (Quaternary) geologic time 

to present, the accumulation of minerals eroded from the drainage area supplying the lake, coupled with 

persistent desert conditions, has altered the chemistry of the groundwater in the unconsolidated lacustrine 

and alluvial sediments below the Playa surface to that of a mineral-rich brine.  

Figure ‎7-1 shows that the north-south-trending mountains surrounding the Sevier Playa exposed Paleozoic 

basement rocks, as a result of uplift during the Basin and Range orogeny. The Cricket Mountains, in the east, 

expose Cambrian-age quartzites and limestones, while the Black Hills/House Range Mountains in the west 

are composed of Ordovician-age dolomites. Below the Playa, and on the lower-lying margins of the 

surrounding mountains, a layered series of sedimentary deposits and erosional features of the Pleistocene 

and Quaternary ages have been surface mapped and observed from drill cuttings. These largely 

unconsolidated sediments are composed of a mixture of clay, sand, and marl (carbonate-rich silt-sized 

sediments). The courser-grained sandy and marly layers contain saturated and semi-saturated levels of brine 

and groundwater that have accumulated in the subsurface over the dry Quaternary Period. 

As suggested by (Case & Cook, 1979), the depth to bedrock within the Sevier Playa may be as much as 

4,500 feet (1,371.6 meters). Four wells drilled by CPMC on the margins of the Playa show the basin sediment 

to be a minimum of 975 feet (297 meters) deep, given that no Paleozoic bedrock was encountered in these 

holes. CPMC drilled a hole in lake sediments to 497 feet (152 meters) in depth. Lithologic logs of these holes 

illustrate mainly fine-grained, gray-green to brown clays with minor amounts of gypsum, sand, silt, salt, 

carbonaceous, and organic material from surface to total depth.

7.2 Geologic Structure 

A detailed structural study of the region was undertaken by Case and Cook after completing a gravity survey 

in the area (Case & Cook, 1979). Their interpretation of the Sevier Playa structure is illustrated in Figure ‎7-2 

and Figure ‎7-3. Figure ‎7-4 shows an additional interpretation that incorporates some of the lithologic 

intercepts from surrounding water wells and deep lake exploration holes. Between the Playa and the Cricket 

Mountains to the east, a major north-south-trending normal fault zone exists, designated as the East Sevier 

Lake Fault Zone. There is an estimated vertical displacement of over 4,000 feet (1,219 meters), with down-

throw on the west. This fault zone forms the east margin of the east-tilted Sevier Lake graben and the west 

margin of the east-tilted Cricket Mountains horst. The Sevier Lake graben is bordered on the west by the 

West Sevier Lake Fault Zone. The graben that underlies the Sevier Playa reportedly consists of two separate 

fault blocks, designated as the northern and southern blocks. These two blocks have been displaced 

differentially with respect to each other and with respect to the adjacent mountain blocks. 

7.3 Mineralization 

Composition of the thin salt crust covering the Playa consists of evaporite minerals and is approximately 3 to 

4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 centimeters) thick, ranging up to as much as 18 inches (45.7 centimeters) in areas, as 

determined from drilling and augering data. Evaporite minerals forming the crust tend to be zoned on the 

Playa surface with halite (NaCl) being the dominant mineral in the center of the Playa, followed by glauberite 

(Na2Ca(SO4)2), and then gypsum (CaSO4) near the Playa shore (Godbe, 1984; Rasmussen, 1997). 

Soluble salts, in the sediment-hosted brine, are the target mineralization of current development work. The 

source of soluble salts is the erosion and leaching of Paleozoic-era bedrock in the Sevier and Bear River 

drainages. Observation and sampling of Playa sediments and brine have identified the following features that 

characterize the top 100 feet (30.5 meters) of the deposit: 

 Salt crust approximately 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 centimeters) thick. 

 Lateral zonation in crust mineral chemistry. 

 Vertical zonation in sediment mineral chemistry. 

 Variation in brine saturation both laterally and with depth. 

 Variation in sediment grain size distribution. 

 Artesian brine flow in some areas. 

 Elevated concentrations of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, and sulfate in the 

brine. 

These features influence, to varying degrees, the target brine extent (volume) and potential for production of 

potash, halite, and bitterns from the brine. The focus of the Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates 

presented in this report are three shallow (depths less than 100 feet [30.5 meters]) brine saturated horizons 

termed the FCZ, MCZ and SCZ, from top to bottom. Below these horizons is a dry, hard clay.

7.4 Playa Stratigraphy 

Figure ‎7-5 is a stratigraphic column of the brine aquifers illustrating the average depth and internal features 

of the three major brine-saturated horizons. The FCZ and MCZ occupy what was previously referenced in 

prior technical reports as the upper resource zone (URZ). The SCZ occupies what was previously called the 

lower resource zone (LRZ). Each of the three major horizons is discussed separately below. 

7.4.1 Fat Clay Zone 

The FCZ derives its name from its physical properties, being described predominately as plastic (fat) clay with 

low hydraulic conductivity. This dense gray clay is capped by a thin salt crust that is typically several inches 

thick over most of the Playa, but can range up to 18 inches (0.5 meters) thick in certain areas, according to 

CPMC auger logs(Gwynn, 2006). The FCZ averages approximately 12.8 feet (3.8 meters) in thickness and is 

comprised of two sub-horizons. The upper part of the FCZ consists of 9.35 feet (2.9 meters) thick 

homogenous, dense, plastic clay. This clay zone is observed to contain gypsum crystals up to 6-inches (15.2-

centimeters) in diameter. Underlying this homogenous clay is a plastic clay zone, 1.64 feet (0.5 meters) thick 

that contains abundant organic material, commonly appearing as grass mats and root structures, 

representing a dry period when the Playa surface was covered by grassy beds. This organic clay zone is an 

important marker bed that separates the FCZ from the underlying MCZ below.  

7.4.2 Marl Clay Zone 

The MCZ is described as a gray, bedded, granular clay averaging 16.67 feet (5.1 meters) in thickness. The 

granular texture arises from what is observed to be silt-size granules of smaller clay particles loosely bound 

by a soft calcareous or gypsiferous matrix. The clay zone is also observed to contain numerous gypsum 

crystals up to 6-inches (15.2-centimeters) in diameter. An unconsolidated sand and gravel bed frequently 

occurs near the top of the MCZ, but is not consistent throughout the Playa. Where present, this sandy or 

gravelly zone averages a thickness of 18 inches (45.7 centimeters).  

A dense zone of stiff clay averaging approximately 3.3 feet (1 meter) thick occurs approximately 2.9 feet 

(0.9 meters) below the sand and gravel bed, where present. It has been identified, in those exploration holes 

where handheld penetrometer readings have been taken, at regular intervals, in the core samples and used 

as a rough guide to determine the overall hardness of the Playa sediments. Penetrometer readings for the 

stiff clay zone of the MCZ range from between 1.5 to 3.0 st/ft
2
 (1.5 to 3 kg/cm

2
). For comparison, the 

surrounding marl clay has penetrometer readings between 0 to 1.25 st/ft
2
 (0 to 1.25 kg/cm

2
) The overlying 

fat clay has penetrometer readings between 0 and 0.5 st/ft
2
 (0.5 kg/cm

2
), and underlying siliceous clay has 

penetrometer readings ranging from 0.75 to 1.25 st/ft
2
 (0.75 to 1.25 kg/cm

2
) as shown in the right-hand 

column of Figure ‎7-5. 

Below the stiff clay bed is a further 9.8 feet (3 meters) of marl clay that transitions rapidly into predominantly 

siliceous clay, the underlying SCZ. The contact between the marl clay and underlying siliceous clay is easily 

supported by the sediment mineralogy and carbonate content test results from XRD mineralogy analyses. 

The average carbonate contents derived from drill core samples are illustrated in the stratigraphic column 

shown in Figure ‎7-5.

7.4.3 Siliceous Clay Zone 

The SCZ is identified as an olive gray, quartz-rich clay with a relatively low carbonate content, averaging 

approximately 30% carbonates noticeably lower than the overlying MCZ. Four sand and gravel beds have 

been identified within the SCZ from drillhole records, but are not consistent throughout the Playa. The 

thickness of these sand and gravel units decreases from the margins of the lakebed toward the center of the 

Playa, where these beds are often missing from the drillhole records. Average thicknesses of the sand and 

gravel beds, where present, vary from 1.6 to 2.9 feet (0.5 to 0.9 meters). The base of the siliceous clay unit is 

marked by the presence of a dull red, dry, hard clay with hand-held penetrometer readings exceeding 5 st/ft
2
 

(5 kg/cm
2
). 

Drilling to date is insufficient to accurately determine a brine Mineral Resource potential below these three 

shallow aquifers.

ITEM 8: DEPOSIT TYPES 

The deposit type of the Sevier Playa is a terminal lakebed (playa) brine deposit. The brine deposit is 

sedimentary in origin and composed of the natural concentration of mineral salts in groundwater found in 

the Playa. The brine is contained within the unconsolidated Playa sediments, composed primarily of clay and 

marl, a lime or calcium-rich clay. While the sediments may play a role in the mineral occurrence, 

development efforts to date have focused primarily on the mineral content found in the brine. The 

extractability of the brine Mineral Resource and the interaction between the brine mineralization and the 

potential for recharge by water flowing through the Playa sediments is part of this investigation, and an 

integral part of the determination of total extractable Mineral Reserves of SOP and other potential mineral 

compounds. 

Most of the world's potash occurrences are found in subsurface bedded salt deposits that can yield high-

grade ore amenable to underground mining or in-situ recovery methods. The Playa lakes of Utah and "salars" 

of South America, a similar physiographic environment found along the eastern Andes region of Chile and 

Argentina, are areas where vast resources of brines have been identified. These mineral brines are sought 

not only for their potash, but also for other valuable minerals such as lithium (Li) and bromine (Br). 

The market generally refers to two primary types of potash—MOP and SOP. Whereby 88% of the potash used 

in fertilizer is in the form of MOP; the remainder is primarily from SOP, which typically commands a premium 

price. SOP rarely occurs naturally; most is produced synthetically or through beneficiation and processing. 

Brine deposits rich in sulfates are more likely to produce SOP than chloride-rich brine. 

Figure ‎8-1 shows the location of the Sevier Playa in relation to the other two mineral brine occurrences in 

Utah, the Great Salt Lake waterbody and the Great Salt Lake Desert, where Great Salt Lake Minerals 

Corporation (GSLMC) and Intrepid, respectively, are producing potash products. The two operations both 

produce potash; however, GSLMC produces SOP by solar evaporation of the brackish surface waters of the 

Great Salt Lake, while Intrepid produces MOP through solar evaporation of brine collected as groundwater 

through trenches and production wells, channeled through a canal system leading to its solar evaporation 

ponds near the town of Wendover, located on the Utah-Nevada border. The Intrepid operation is the closest 

corollary to the Sevier Playa, in that the brine occurs as groundwater hosted in fine-grained sediments and 

evaporites. However, the brine chemistry at Intrepid's Wendover operation is more suitable for MOP 

production due to its lack of sulfates.

Numerous exploration programs and scientific studies have focused on the Sevier Playa, investigating its 

climate, sediment and brine characteristics, and potential for production of potash and related minerals. 

Prior to 2011, these works are considered historic and have only marginal context to the objective of defining 

a current Mineral Resource for the Property. Several prior Technical Reports describe past (pre-2011) 

exploration and development work in some detail, as well as in rather more depth (Gwynn, 2006). The focus 

of this section is on exploration activities, i.e., non-drilling related data collection and analysis, conducted 

since CPMC began project development efforts in 2011. 

Key exploration items and field-related activities relevant to this study are discussed below and in other 

sections of this Technical Report. These items include:  

 Gravity surveys 

 Topography surveys 

 Playa boundary surveys 

 Brine aquifer boundary surveys 

 Direct push borehole program 

 Mini-sonic borehole program 

 Brine geochemical sampling 

 Hydrologic characterization program 

 Geotechnical characterization program 

Exploration drilling, specifically the direct push and mini-sonic borehole programs, is discussed in ‎Item 10: 

Drilling. The geochemical, hydrologic, and geotechnical characterization programs, having components 

related to the exploration and data acquisition stages, are discussed in the sections below; however, the 

analytical and modeling/interpretation components of each of these categories bridge into successive 

sections of this Technical Report. Further discussions of these components are found in the following 

sections: 

 ‎Item 11: Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

o Brine sampling and analysis for geochemical characterization, and Mineral Resource and 

Reserve estimation. 

o Lakebed sediment sampling and analysis for geochemical characterization, bulk density and 

moisture content determination for Mineral Resource and Reserve estimation. 

o Hydrogeological sediment samples retrieved by Shelby tube for analysis of geochemical 

transfer from sediment to brine solution (solute transport).

model parameters. 

o Geotechnical sediment samples retrieved by Shelby tube for soil strength and other 

parameters used in trench and dike design. 

o Cone Penetrometer Test (CPT) data collection for geotechnical considerations.

9.2 Gravity Survey 

The 1979 gravity survey by Case and Cook was performed with the intention of delineating the potential 

depth of basin sediments (Case & Cook, 1979). Their interpretation of the Sevier Playa structure is illustrated 

in Figure ‎7-3 and Figure ‎7-4, located in ‎Item 7: Geological Setting and Mineralization.  

Starting in 1976, a total of 970 gravity field measurement stations were employed, covering an area of 772 

mi
2
 (2,000 km

2
), including and surrounding the Sevier Playa. The interpretations of the gravity survey 

indicated a major north-south normal fault zone, or graben as illustrated in Figure ‎7-3 and Figure ‎7-4. Case 

and Cook concluded that the Sevier Lake graben contained up to 4,500 feet (1,371.6 meters) of alluvium, and 

this valley-fill material acts as a reservoir for potentially valuable brines and soluble salts within the 

sedimentary basin formed by the graben (Case & Cook, 1979). 

Other than the Case and Cook gravity survey, there is no documentation of other ground or aerial 

geophysical surveys having been performed prior to the development work initiated by CPMC in 2011.

9.3 Topography Survey 

Between 2011 and 2013, various topographic surveys were undertaken by Sunrise Engineering (Sunrise) 

using a total station Global Positioning System (GPS). The purpose of these topographic surveys was to 

determine the extent of the Playa boundary, locate collars of the boreholes drilled during the 2011 to 2013 

exploration programs, and to obtain additional spot elevation measurements of the lakebed surface for 

geological modeling and Mineral Resource definition. 

These initial surveys were supplemented by a detailed Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) topographic and 

imaging survey conducted in 2015 by Aero-Graphics Inc. (Aero-Graphics), over the entire Playa. Between 

June 8, 2015 and June 17, 2015, Aero-Graphics acquired both digital 4-band stereo imagery and high-

resolution LiDAR data over approximately 330 mi
2
 (100.58 m

2
) of ground surface covering and surrounding 

the Playa. 

For this Project, the LiDAR acquisition was performed with an Optech ALTM Orion H300 LiDAR sensor. Using a 

Cessna 2016 flying at an average altitude of 7,054 feet (2,150 meters) above ground surface (ags), the data 

acquisition averaged 1.4 points per square yard with 50% overlap. The Non-Vegetated Vertical Accuracy 

(NVA) results for the LiDAR survey were estimated by Aero-Graphics to be 4.63 feet (1.41 meters), at the 95% 

confidence level.  

Stereo image acquisition was performed using the Microsoft/Vexcel UCE digital camera system. The imagery 

acquisition platform was a Piper PA-146 Malibu aircraft, operating at an altitude of 9,593 feet (2,924 meters) 

ags.  

Aero-Graphics also used Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) base stations and statically-

collected survey data at strategic points throughout the Project area to ensure that the LiDAR and image data 

maintained its true geographic integrity. Additional technical information pertaining to the LiDAR survey can 

be found in the Sevier Playa Aerial Survey report (AeroGraphics, Inc., 2015). 

All Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates outlined in this Technical Report are limited to the surface 

topographic elevations as delineated by the 2015 Aero-Graphics LiDAR survey. 

9.4 Playa Boundary Surveys 

The Playa boundary used, in the current and prior geologic models, is sourced from the public domain 

Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC) website (see AGRC.utah.gov). A Playa boundary survey was 

completed in 2011 by Sunrise using a total station GPS. The mapped Playa boundary survey points tracked 

the AGRC boundary without any materially significant differences; a careful comparison determined only 

0.7% difference in the Playa area between the AGRC data and the Sunrise-mapped boundary. The initial Playa 

boundary was also compared with the 2015 LiDAR survey data, and was found to be very closely aligned, with 

significant topographic change evident where surrounding non-Playa terrain transitions into the relatively flat 

Playa surface between 4,528 and 4,534 feet (1,380 and 1,382 meters) elevation AMSL.  

All Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates outlined in this Technical Report are limited to within the same 

Playa boundary as outlined in the 2013 PFS report as validated by the 2011 Sunrise GPS survey and 2015 

Aero-Graphics LiDAR survey.

9.5 Brine Aquifer Boundary Surveys 

The 2013 PFS Technical Report limited the extent of the brine aquifer to the Playa surface boundary, and 

exploration drilling to that date did not find a lesser thickness in brine-saturated clays from the center 

towards the margins of the Playa. As part of the larger geotechnical program, a series of CPT holes were 

completed on or near the Playa boundary. A total of 17 holes were completed in four fence lines, generally 

perpendicular to the Playa boundary, ranging from 428 to 761 feet (130 to 232 meters) in length. Each fence 

line included four to five holes, and depth of refusal ranged from 35 to 80 feet (11 to 24 meters). Pore 

pressure dissipation (PPD) tests were performed at nine locations and at varying depths. The locations of the 

CPT drill sites are illustrated in Figure ‎9-1.

The interpretation of the CPT and PPD data provides a high-resolution indication of geotechnical properties 

such as settlement and shear strength, as well as soil stratigraphy. The soil types identified by the tests range 

from clay to a gravelly sand, although most soils were fine-grained in nature, primarily clayey silt and silt. The 

results of the PPD tests indicate a range of soils from clay to coarse-grained soil. However, seven of the nine 

tests demonstrated a high initial increase in pore pressure; following by a relatively slow dissipation of 

pressure, as is typical of fine-grained soils. 

The overall and dominant litho-type, based on the CPT results, indicates the Playa sediments near the Playa 

boundary to be mostly clay and silt down to an average refusal depth of 50 feet (15.2 meters) bgs. However, 

the sediment profiles from the CPT drilling cannot be easily correlated with sediment horizons identified from 

the exploration drilling and incorporated into the Playa hydrostratigraphic model. The lack of correlation is 

interpreted to result from the rapid change from pure lakebed sediments to overlapping coarse clastic 

outwash from surrounding terrain. The characteristics of the clastic outwash are very localized and can vary 

significantly in thickness, areal extent, lithologic composition and grain/clast size. Coarse-grained layers 

occurring in the FCZ and MCZ, at 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) or thicker rarely extend more than 500 feet 

(152.4 meters) into the Playa, with the exception of one persistent course-grained horizon typically occurring 

at approximately 15 feet (4.3 meters) bgs. There are few CPT penetrations of what would be interpreted as 

the SCZ and no correlations with the SCZ sand and gravel layers are evident. 

The conclusion from the interpretation of the CPT drilling is that the brine aquifer clay sediments do extend 

beyond the Playa boundary, interfingering with the layers of clastic outwash, and that the absolute limit of 

these brine-saturated sediments beyond the Playa boundary has yet to be determined. As such, the brine 

aquifer boundary of this study is limited to the same physiographic Sevier Playa boundary as originally 

outlined in the 2013 PFS, as adjusted to the 2015 LiDAR survey.  

Assessment of the vertical limits of the brine Mineral Resource utilized groundwater level measurements 

obtained from completed wells across the Playa for the upper boundary and lithologic interpretation of the 

base of the SCZ where it contacts the dry, hard clay as the brine Mineral Resource base. Water level 

measurements show the majority of the Playa exhibits mild artesian conditions, and the lowest water 

readings to be less than 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) bgs, realizing a net potentiometric surface slightly above 

the Playa's topographic elevation. 

9.6 Surface Water Characterization Program 

The surface water characterization program consisted of three primary components: 

 Evaluation of annual Sevier River flow. 

 Evaluation of annual surface water runoff from the Sevier Playa Basin watersheds. 

 Evaluation of annual surface water ponding due to direct precipitation on the Sevier Playa. 

A summary discussion of these areas follows below. 

9.6.1 Sevier River 

Sevier River surface water flow was evaluated using multiple methods, including a combination of historical 

flow estimation and Sevier River hydraulic modeling, discussed in detail in the Water Balance Model Report 

(CH2M Hill, 2017d).  



NI 43-101 Technical Report Summarizing the Feasibility Study for the Sevier Playa Potash Project, Millard County, Utah 
Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 68 

Novopro Projects Inc. 

The historical flow estimation was performed using records provided to CPMC by the Sevier River Water 

Users Association (SRWUA), Water Master for the lower Sevier River. Using the SRWUA records from 1985 to 

2015, a 31-year history of estimated flow released from the Gunnison Bend Reservoir to the Sevier River was 

calculated and are presented in the Water Balance Model Report (CH2M Hill, 2017d). 

The July 2017 Evaluation of Sevier River Transmission Losses and Discharge Report (CH2M Hill, 2017a), 

provides quantification of transmission losses (i.e., losses resulting from infiltration of water into channel 

sediments) from the Gunnison Bend Reservoir to the Sevier Playa. To quantify transmission losses, this reach 

of the Sevier River was modeled using a Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-

HMS). Field data were used to validate the HEC-HMS model parameters; the field data included discharge 

and hydrograph data from 10 Sevier River gauging stations (installed in July 2012), sediment characterization, 

and hydraulic conductivity analysis from 16 thin-wall soil samples (collected in September 2016), as well as 

estimation of cross-sectional areas for four Sevier River stream gauging stations locations. 

9.6.2 Sevier Playa Basin Watersheds 

A 31-year history of the annual volume of surface water runoff from basin watersheds to the Sevier Playa was 

reconstructed and evaluated using the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM), as detailed in the Surface 

Runoff Analysis for the Mountain Watersheds Surrounding the Sevier Lake Playa Report (CH2M Hill, 2017b). 

The primary model input parameters included precipitation, infiltration, and evaporation. To refine the 

precipitation input parameter, 30 years of precipitation data from eight different meteorological stations 

were merged and weighted. To refine the infiltration input parameter, 40 soil samples were collected across 

the catchment areas for sediment characterization and hydraulic conductivity testing. To refine the 

evaporation input parameter, updated reference evapotranspiration values from the Utah Climate Center 

(UCC) for Delta, Utah were used. 

9.6.3 Sevier Playa Ponded Precipitation 

A 31-year history of the volume of water that ponded on the surface of the Sevier Playa due to precipitation 

was reconstructed and evaluated using a Hydrus-1D model, as detailed in the Technical Memorandum, 

Results of a Numerical Analysis of Potential Surface Ponding Resulting from Direct Precipitation at Sevier Lake 

Playa, Millard County, Utah (CH2M Hill, 2017c). The primary objective of the Hydrus-1D model was to 

compute the ponding depth at the Playa surface as a function of historical meteorological conditions, 

including precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET), and soil hydraulic properties. The precipitation 

data set used in the Hydrus 1D model was the same precipitation data set described above in Section ‎9.6.2: 

Sevier Playa Basin Watersheds. The PET data set was from a meteorological station located in Delta, Utah. 

The sediment hydraulic properties used in the Hydrus-1D model were based on laboratory‐determined soil 

moisture retention curves from three sediment cores collected from the upper 12 feet (3.7 meters) of the 

Sevier Playa. The saturated hydraulic conductivity used on the Hydrus-1D model was based on the results of 

16 laboratory permeability tests of soil samples collected within 12 feet (3.7 meters) of the Sevier Playa 

surface. 

9.7 Groundwater Hydrology Program 

A series of wells and trenches were completed for the purpose of hydrologic characterization of the brine 

Mineral Resource and recoverable Mineral Reserve. Wells were completed for pumping tests and other

hydrologic investigations, as well as monitoring wells around trench testing sites and trench/well cluster 

pairings. A summary of relevant field work and data collection on the Sevier Playa follows. A description of 

the laboratory testing for hydrologic characterization, and the analysis and results of the hydrologic modeling 

determined from the acquired hydrologic data, is described in ‎Item 14: Mineral Resource Estimates and ‎Item 

15: Mineral Reserve Estimates, respectively.  

In Figure ‎9-2, the locations of the trench-to-trench (TtT) and well-to-trench (WtT) test sites are shown. The 

overall objectives of the hydrogeological program were to: 

 Assess hydraulic and solute transport properties of the MCZ. 

 Assess flow of brine from trenches under long-term pumping conditions. 

 Assess ability to recharge MCZ with fresh water through trenches. 

9.7.1 Water Level Data 

A comprehensive water level survey of the on- and off-playa wells was performed in July 2015. The 

results of the study recorded the following items: 

 Well ID  

 Elevation at top of casing 

 Depth-to-water 

 Potentiometric surface elevation 

 Relative position to the Playa boundary (on-, off-, margin)

9.7.2 Well Aquifer Testing Program 

9.7.2.1 Overview 

Hydrologic testing of selected wells was conducted by CH2M in 2011 and 2013; the data from these wells 

were used in the PFS (CH2M Hill, 2013). To further expand the database for Playa sediment hydraulic 

properties, a series of the 2015 exploration boreholes were converted to hydrologic monitoring and test 

wells. Some of these wells were matched with previously developed wells and others in areas not yet 

evaluated. These wells were used to determine and expand the areal distribution of knowledge of hydraulic 

parameters across the Playa, gain a better understanding of the interaction between the MCZ and SCZ, and 

to determine the hydraulic and geochemical relationship within the various zones of Playa materials. 

The sections below summarize the various well configurations, the test methods used, the data collected, 

and the analysis of the data utilized to determine the hydraulic conductivity and storage values of the Playa 

materials. Additional discussions of the results in the geohydrologic modeling are presented in ‎Item 14: 

Mineral Resource Estimates and ‎Item 15: Mineral Reserve Estimates. 

9.7.3 Well Configuration 

Based on the lithologic and water occurrence logs, the wells were divided into an upper zone (generally 

shallower than 40 feet (12 meters) bgs, essentially representing the MCZ and a lower zone (generally deeper 

than 40 feet (12 meters) bgs, essentially representing the SCZ).  

Three of the borings were completed as 6-inch (15.2-centimeter) wells to allow evaluation of pump stress on 

more productive zones. The remaining wells were completed as 4-inch (10.2-centimeters) wells. Typical 

completion of the piezometers consisted of: 

 5 feet (1.5 meters) of solid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) threaded casing with end cap to act as a sump. 

 Variable lengths of slotted PVC threaded screen with a #10 slot aperture. For SCZ, 40 to 60 feet 

(12 to 18 meters) depending on the bottom of the lower zone. For the MCZ, 20 feet (6 meters) of 

screen. 

 Variable lengths of PVC threaded blank casing to approximately 2 feet (0.6 meters) of stick-up ags. 

 Filter pack of pea gravel placed from the bottom of the hole to a point above the top of the screened 

interval, depending on the zones where water was encountered. 

 3 to 5 feet (1 to 1.5 meters) of 10/20 sand from top of pea gravel, to minimize seepage of cement 

grout. 

 Cement grout from the top of the 10/20 sand to a point approximately 2 feet (0.6 meters) bgs. 

 PVC casing extended between 2 and 3 feet (0.6 and 1 meter) ags with lid. 

Figure ‎9-3 presents diagrams of typical MCZ and SCZ piezometer completions. 

Following the completion of the piezometer installations, each piozemeter was cleaned by a combination of 

bailing and pumping. The standing water in the piezometer was surged and evacuated to remove any 

remaining drilling fluid and standing water. For most wells, the drawdown was rather rapid, and the flow 

rates were low. The water level for these wells was drawn down to just above the pump intake, and then the 

pumping was stopped to allow the water level to recover. This process was repeated several times, and then

the pumping was continued at a lower rate. When the pumped water was relatively clear, it was determined 

that the well was adequately developed. One well (SN4-15-002) was dewatered within 20 minutes of start of 

development pumping and did not recover within three days following development pumping. Therefore, it 

was assumed to not be representative of the Playa sediments. Following development, the wells were 

allowed to stand for a period of at least three days before any additional work was undertaken to allow the 

water levels to equilibrate. 

The initial data collected from the piezometers included water levels, hydraulic analyses, and water quality 

sampling of the water bearing zones. Static water levels were obtained using a 0.01 foot (0.003 meters) 

sounding tape.

9.7.3.1 Subsurface Samples 

During the drilling of the wells, over every 5-foot (1.5-meter) interval on the majority of the core holes, a bulk 

sample was collected for moisture content. Additionally, a series of 3.5- or 5-inch (9- or 13-centimeter) 

diameter Shelby tube samples were collected at selected points for moisture content (select samples), 

geotechnical, and column testing purposes. 

9.7.3.2 Aquifer Test Methods 

A series of different aquifer tests were conducted following the development activities. These included 

standard aquifer drawdown testing for single and multiple wells, injection and withdrawal testing between 

two wells, and push-pull testing for a single well. 

In December 2015 and January 2016, aquifer tests were performed to measure hydraulic properties of the 

upper and lower zones from 25 piezometers spread across the Playa. They consisted of 13 tests at new wells 

in the upper zone, 16 tests at new wells in the lower zone, and 6 verification well tests at pre-existing wells. 

Figure ‎9-4 presents the location of the tested wells. Table ‎9-1 presents the wells tested, the zones tested, 

and the duration of the tests.

9.7.3.2.1 Aquifer Testing – Data Collection 

Observations recorded during testing included the flow rate, drawdown, and duration of pumping. Pumping 

duration ranged from 0.03 to 120 hours, depending on well production. Following the pumping phase, the 

pump was shut in and the water level recovery was recorded. Typically, the short-term pumping was 

commenced in the early morning, the pumping phase was run during the day, pumping discontinued in the 

evening, and recovery was allowed to occur over night. When water levels returned to 90% of drawdown 

recovery, the testing was discontinued. Additionally, barometric pressure was recorded in hourly increments 

for the Playa area to allow the long-term testing data to be adjusted for atmospheric pressure changes. The 

water level data were downloaded from the transducers and barometric data from the Playa meteorological 

station operated by CPM. For each aquifer test, drawdown data were adjusted for barometric pressure 

changes over the period of the test. This adjustment was required for the long-term tests. 

All hydraulic analyses for the standard single and multiple well aquifer tests were performed with 

AQTESOLV 4.5 or MLU software. For the AQTESOLV analysis, this method resulted in the best data fit and was 

used in all cases. Detailed numerical analysis from the sands and gravels and lower zone clays were evaluated 

using the MLU software. These analyses determined hydraulic conductivity variations between the sands and 

gravels and the clays. Table ‎9-2 presents the aquifer test results.  

Nested well tests and column tests determined the vertical hydraulic conductivity. These were used to 

determine the vertical gradients and determine potential connections, if any, between the MCZ and SCZ 

zones.

9.7.3.2.2 Aquifer Testing – Injection Testing 

A series of well-to-well (WtW) injection and single well push-pull tests were conducted at selected wells. WtW 

injection tests were conducted at wells 15-01-RR-7, 15-03 – SN3-260, and 15-12 – 15-12A in the SCZ, and wells 

WW-1A – WW-1B, WW-2C – WW-2B, WW-3A – WW-3B, and WW-6A – WW-6B in the MCZ. Since no 

breakthrough was identified at wells 15-01 and 15-12, the WtW injection test was converted to push-pull 

tests. 

For the WtW tests, the tasks consisted of injecting fresh water under pressure while monitoring the change in 

flow rate and pressure at the well head of the injection well and monitoring water level and conductivity at 

the adjacent well. These tests were conducted to determine the standard aquifer hydraulic parameters, to 

assess the potential duration for fresh water breakthrough, and the mixing potential within the aquifer.  

The push-pull tests consisted of injecting a known quantity of fresh water into the brine aquifer and allowing 

the water to stand for a variable period of time. Each push-pull test was conducted for differing periods for a 

minimum of four days to several months. The wells were pumped at a known constant rate, the discharge 

flow conductivity was monitored, and samples were collected to assess the change in the water quality. 

Sampling procedures, protocol, and key results are presented and discussed in ‎Item 11: Sample Preparation, 

Analyses and Security. 

9.7.3.2.3 Aquifer Testing – Column Testing 

Selected samples from the Shelby tubes for the upper and lower zones were used for small scale testing of the 

flow of fresh water through the aquifer materials, under controlled conditions. Nine column tests were 

conducted to evaluate the vertical hydraulic conductivity in different materials, assess brine/matrix break-

through relationships, and potential for mass transfer.  

The 5-inch (12.7-centimeter) Shelby tube samples were connected to a pressurized de-ionized fresh water 

source, and the flow rate and pressure of the inflow water was monitored and recorded along with the 

specific conductivity of the water/brine discharged from the tubes. Also, incremental composite samples of 

discharge water were collected to assess the changes in brine concentration over time. This testing assisted in 

monitoring the potential for fresh water breakthrough and calculation of the hydraulic conductivity and 

drainable percentage of the various samples were determined and are presented in Table ‎9-3. Location of the 

tested sample locations are depicted in Figure ‎9-5.

9.7.3.2.4 Aquifer Testing - Centrifuge Testing 

Selected samples from the Shelby tubes for the upper and lower zones were used for centrifuge testing. The 

tests were based on gravity extraction (ASTM D425) methods of in-situ samples to determine the percentage 

of water remaining in the sample at various pressures. This provides an indication of the drainable percentage 

of the various materials used to determine the Mineral Reserve base and extractability. Nineteen tests were 

conducted and used with the percent moisture to determine the brine extraction volume. The results of these 

analyses are also presented in Table ‎9-3. Concerns were raised regarding the high drainable porosity 

determined from this testing which are more indicative of a sand and gravel matrix rather than the clay and 

marl matrix of the samples. For these reasons, these results were not used in the planning or modeling. 

9.7.3.2.5 Aquifer Testing – Relative Brine Release Capacity Testing 

To verify the results of the centrifuge testing, selected samples from upper and lower zone Shelby tubes were 

used for Relative Brine Release Capacity (RBRC) determinations made by DB Stephens & Associates soil 

laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico (DB Stephens lab). This method predicts the volume of solution that 

can readily be extracted from an unstressed geologic sample.  

The RBDC tests consist of obtaining an intact sub-sample from each Shelby tube sample by gently advancing a 

testing ring approximately 2.5-inch diameter x 1.5-inch length (6.35 centimeters diameter x 3.81 centimeters 

length) into the original sample. The undisturbed samples from the site were saturated in the laboratory using 

site-specific brine solution.  

Once the samples were saturated, the samples were weighed. The volumetric moisture (brine) contents were 

calculated using the client-provided brine solution density of 0.0408 lbs/in
3 

(1.13 g/cm
3
). The particle density 

of each sample was calculated based on the assumption that the sample was 100% saturated after the 

saturation stage of the test procedure. The calculated particle density was then used to calculate the total 

porosity of the sample. 

The bottoms of the sub-sample rings were then attached to a vacuum pump using tubing and permeable end 

caps, and subjected to a suction of 4.83 psi (33.3 kPa) for 18 to 24 hours. The top end cap was fitted with a 

one-gallon air bladder, which allows sufficient drainage while inhibiting continuous atmospheric air flow. 

Post-testing, each sub-sample was first oven dried at 140°F (60°C) for three days, weighed, and then again 

oven dried at 230°F (110°C) for two days and weighed again. This double treatment was to assess the fine clay 

fraction to determine if there were any differences. Density, moisture content, and porosity calculations based 

on both the 140°F (60°C) oven dry mass and the 230°F (110°C) oven dry mass are presented in the Laboratory 

Report from the Daniel B. Stephens and Associates, Inc. (DBS&A) laboratory (Daniel B. Stephens and 

Associates, Inc., 2016).  

Based on the density of the brine, the sample mass at saturation, and the sample mass at 'vacuum dry,' the 

volumetric moisture (brine) contents of the samples are calculated. The difference between the volumetric 

moisture (brine) content of the saturated sample and the volumetric moisture (brine) content of the 'vacuum 

dry' sample is the "relative brine release capacity." Table ‎9-4 presents the results for samples dried at both 

140°F (60°C) and 230°C (110°C). As can be seen, there is no difference between the results.

9.7.3.2.6 Brine Sampling 

Initial water quality samples were collected following development of the sonic wells and were used to 

characterize the brine concentration and geochemical characteristics. For the MCZ, a sample was collected 

from each of the WtW sites. For the SCZ, a series of three samples from most of the SCZ wells were collected 

to characterize the brine vertically. Well SN4-15-03 was not sampled because injection testing was 

inadvertently conducted before the well was sampled for brine concentrations. However, the adjacent SN3-

260 well was sampled in its place. These samples provided a description of the changes in brine chemistry 

both within the different aquifer zones and spatially across the Playa. 

Since it was necessary to obtain relatively undisturbed brine samples from the vertical profile of the strata, the 

standard protocol of removing three borehole volumes from the SCZ piezometers before sampling was not 

used because it would create a composite of the brine from various layers. Instead a low-flow sampling 

protocol was utilized. This consisted of lowering the sampling pump to the depth to be sampled and extracting 

brine at a low flow rate representative of the flow into the screen at that portion of the aquifer. The discharge 

continued until both the volume of the discharge line was removed, and then until the pH, conductivity and 

temperature values of the brine discharge stabilized. This sampling was repeated at the top, middle, and 

bottom of the screen interval. These samples were then analyzed for the parameters shown in Table ‎9-5. 

The water quality samples were submitted to ALS in Salt Lake City, Utah, for analysis. Analytical results were 

tabulated and compared to determine differences in the brine for various areas of the Playa and water bearing 

zones. To assist in verifying the laboratory results, duplicate samples were collected and submitted for 

analysis.

9.7.3.3 Trench-to-Trench Test Program 

A field-scale test of the proposed mine plan trench concept was initiated in 2015, as shown in Figure ‎9-6. For 

the TtT test, three trenches 100 feet (30.5 meters) in length were excavated through the FCZ and into the MCZ 

to a depth of 20 feet (6.1 meters) bgs. The three trenches were cut parallel to each other with their 

centerlines spaced approximately 100 feet (30.6 meters) apart, as shown in Figure ‎9-6. The trenches were

excavated with side wall slopes of 0.5:1 (horizontal to vertical), and trench bottoms that were approximately 

4 feet (1.2 meters) wide. The test concept was to monitor water levels and chemistry while brine was pumped 

from the extraction trench and fresh water (from the Lakeview Well) was supplied to the recharge trenches. 

During the trench excavations, groundwater did not enter the excavation until the interface between the FCZ 

and MCZ was breached. Once trench depths were below the bottom of the FCZ, brine levels within the trench 

rose to within approximately 1 foot (0.3 meters) bgs. Thus, under natural conditions during trench testing, the 

brine aquifer beneath the FCZ was artesian.

The center trench was originally designed as an extraction trench, and the two outer trenches were originally 

designed as recharge trenches. Prior to the start of the TtT test, the brine within the two outer recharge 

trenches was replaced with fresh water from the Lakeview Well. Next, the brine level in the extraction trench 

was drawn down and maintained near the bottom of the trench to create a driving force for the fresh water in 

the recharge trenches to move through the MCZ toward the extraction trench. Brine that was pumped from 

the extraction trench was conveyed via flexible piping approximately 1,000 feet (305 meters) from the TtT site, 

where it was discharged onto the Playa surface. A recording totalizer, installed in-line within the discharge 

piping, logged the cumulative brine volume extracted over the duration of the test.  

A total of 16 monitoring-well pairs were installed around the trenches to monitor potentiometric levels and 

brine chemistry during testing (Figure ‎9-6). These wells were designed to provide information on the timing of 

the fresh water "front" as it moved from the outer recharge trenches toward the center extraction trench.  

The monitoring-well pairs consisted of an upper well screened from approximately 10 to 25 feet 

(3 to 7.6 meters) bgs and a lower well screened from 26 to 41 feet (7.9 to 12.5 meters) bgs. In addition to the 

monitoring wells, a stilling well was installed in each trench to monitor water levels inside the trenches. A 

subset of the wells was instrumented with AquiStar datalogging sensors that monitored pressure (i.e., brine 

level), water temperature and electrical conductivity in the wells. Furthermore, brine levels and electrical 

conductivity were manually measured at all monitoring wells throughout the test period. Water samples were 

also collected throughout the testing period for laboratory testing to determine major ion chemistry and 

stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen.  

The initial TtT test began on September 1, 2015. However, unplanned downtime beginning September 4, 2015 

forced the cancellation of this test. Once water levels had recovered and equipment issues had been resolved, 

a second TtT test was started on September 8, 2015. The second phase of TtT testing lasted for 17 days. The 

total volume of brine removed from the extraction trench over the second phase of the test was 

approximately 994,000 gallons (4,519 m
3
). This equates to an average pumping rate of approximately 41 gpm 

(223.2 m
3
/d) during the test.  

The total volume of fresh water that was recharged by the two trenches was on the order of 100,000 gallons 

(455 m
3
). Although drawdowns in the monitoring wells were measured, significant reductions in the electrical 

conductivity were not detected in either the AquiStar or the manual measurements. However, after one week 

of pumping, water levels in the recharge trenches had declined by approximately 4 feet (1.21 meters) from the 

starting level and no indication of fresh water had been measured in any of the monitoring wells. This suggests 

that either the fresh water front had not arrived at the closest monitoring well during the week the test was 

performed, the fresh water that had been drawn into the brine aquifer had been assimilated before reaching 

the nearest monitoring well, or the less-dense fresh water was more buoyant than the dense brine and flowed 

near the interface between the FCZ and MCZ above the monitoring depths. After one week of pumping, 

significant sloughing of the side walls had occurred within the extraction trench and the trench geometry had 

been compromised. The decision was made to terminate the test.  

The trench configuration at the TtT site was redesigned in a final attempt to induce fresh water flow into the 

MCZ aquifer. The redesign included switching the locations of recharge and extraction trenches so that the 

outer trenches became extraction trenches and the center trench would become a recharge trench. Initially, 

extraction occurred at all three trenches in an effort to suppress the potentiometric surface prior to 

introducing the fresh water recharge. However, sloughing of the trench side walls and heaving of the trench 

bottoms precluded the recharge phase. The final TtT testing ended on October 26, 2015. Between September

26, 2015 and October 26, 2015, extraction occurred for a total of 11 days, with approximately 1.3 million 

gallons (5,910 m
3
) of brine removed. 

Important observations drawn from the TtT test are as follows: 

 Large volumes of brine can be extracted by pumping trenches. 

 Significant artesian pressures limited fresh water recharge at the recharge trenches within the 

available timeframe for conducting the test. 

 A more comprehensive dewatering phase to depressurize the brine aquifer would likely be required 

to create gravity-recharge capacity at the recharge trenches. 

 Significant sloughing of trench side walls made it difficult to maintain trench geometry. 

 Alternative trench designs should be considered. 

The drawdown and extraction rate data collected during the TtT test were used to estimate hydraulic 

properties of the brine aquifer. 

9.7.3.4 Well-to-Trench Test Program 

Given the difficulties associated with the TtT test coupled with the onset of colder and wetter weather, a 

smaller-scale, WtT test was performed approximately 2,320 feet (707 meters) northeast of the TtT site (Figure 

‎9-7). One of the most problematic issues with the TtT test was that artesian pressures could not be reduced 

sufficiently within the given timeframe to test gravity-recharge of fresh water into the brine aquifer at the 

recharge trenches. Thus, the WtT test was designed so that fresh water could be injected under pressure 

directly into the MCZ using a line of five injection wells (Figure ‎9-7). For this test, five monitoring wells were 

installed between the injection wells and the extraction trench. The test concept was to monitor water levels 

and chemistry while brine was pumped from the extraction trench and fresh water was supplied to the 

injection wells. 

The extraction trench was 60 feet (18.3 meters) long and 20 feet (6.1 meters) deep. Given the side-wall 

sloughing observed at the TtT test, the extraction trench at the WtT test had reduced side-wall slopes of 

approximately 1:1 (horizontal to vertical). The five injection wells were installed parallel to the trench and 60 

feet (18.3 meters) from the trench centerline. Injection wells were spaced 10 feet (3.04 meters) apart from 

one another (Figure ‎9-7). Monitoring wells were installed parallel to the trench and 35 feet (10.66 meters) 

from the trench centerline. The monitoring wells were also spaced 10 feet (3 meters) apart. All injection and 

monitoring wells were screened from 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6.1 meters) bgs.  

A pump was placed near the bottom of the extraction trench and operated on a near continuous basis for a 

two-month period. Extraction rates were in the range of 30 to 50 gpm (160 to 270 m
3
/d). Flow from the trench 

was monitored continuously using a totalizer and a datalogger. The extracted brine was discharged 

approximately 1,000 feet (305 meters) from the test site.  

Fresh water was supplied to the injection wells from the Lakeview Well. Each injection well was instrumented 

with a totalizer. The five injection wells operated intermittently over the course of the test and at a range of 

injection rates less than 1 to 4 gpm (5.5 to 21.8 m
3
/d). The intermittent nature of the injection was largely due 

to freezing in the injection lines.

All five of the monitoring wells were instrumented with AquiStar datalogging sensors that monitored pressure 

(i.e., brine level), water temperature, and electrical conductivity in the wells. Furthermore, brine levels and 

electrical conductivity were manually measured at all wells throughout the test period. Water samples were 

also collected during the testing period for laboratory testing to determine major ion chemistry and the stable 

isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen. Electrical conductivity profiling was also performed at each monitoring 

well once or twice per week, where an electrical conductivity probe was slowly moved downward through the 

screened interval and manual measurements were taken at regular intervals. This was performed to detect 

potential chemical stratification in the water column. 

The WtT test was conducted for two months and consisted of two separate injection phases. Trench 

extraction started on October 30, 2015, and the first phase of injection began on October 31, 2015. Injections 

continued intermittently for approximately two weeks until November 18, 2015 when the lines and valves on 

the injection system had completely frozen. Extraction from the extraction trench continued during the period 

that the injection wells were inoperable. A variety of improvements were made to better insulate the injection 

system, and, on December 9, 2015, injections were restarted. Injections continued intermittently until 

December 24, 2015 when the injection system had again completely frozen. Extraction continued at the WtT 

test until January 4, 2016. During the 66-day WtT test, approximately 174,000 gallons (659 m
3
) of fresh water 

had been injected and 3.6 million gallons (13,639 m
3
) of brine had been extracted.  

Important observations drawn from the WtT test include: 

 Significant decreases in the potentiometric elevation, electrical conductivity, and K
+ 

concentration 

were measured at all monitoring wells in comparison to static, pretest conditions.  

 Fresh water from the Lakeview Well was successfully injected into the MCZ at five injection well 

locations and successfully extracted from a nearby trench; thereby demonstrating that the mixing of 

Lakeview Well water with in-situ brine in the MCZ did not result in measurable adverse hydraulic 

effects.  

 The brine aquifer rapidly assimilated the injected fresh water indicating that the mass-transfer 

process was active.  

Data from the WtT test were used to estimate aquifer hydraulic and solute transport parameters. Section 

‎15.3: Conceptual Model Overview describes how select data from the WtT test were used to support mine 

planning. A variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport model was used to simulate the WtT test. 

In this model, potentiometric surface elevations and K
+
 concentrations measured, at the five monitoring wells 

during the two-month test period were used as calibration targets. Along with other site data and professional 

judgment, selected parameters estimated from this test were used to help parameterize the PGFM and PSTM. 

9.8 Geotechnical Program 

The geotechnical programs included the following tests and surveys: 

 Trench design and construction  

 CPT surveys 

 Test pits for permeability testing 

 Sevier River diversion assessment

9.8.1 Trench Design and Construction Tests 

A series of trench construction options were evaluated. These included various slope-sided trenches, vertical 

wall trenches and step-sided trenches. Based on these tests, the slope sided and vertical wall trenches all 

failed due to floor heave once the trenches reached a depth of between 15 and 19 feet (4.6 and 5.8 meters) 

bgs. The step-sided trenches did not exhibit the failure behavior. This configuration remained open and stable 

for the length of the test period.  

9.8.2 Data for Infrastructure Design 

A preliminary geotechnical site investigation was completed in 2013 at the Processing Plant site. This 

investigation consisted of four borings and four CPTs. A series of laboratory tests were conducted on the 

collected soil samples including index testing, compaction testing, strength testing and consolidation testing.  

The September 2015 investigation was conducted by Norwest and included a series of test pits along the Playa 

edge as well as test pits in the Playa near the planned production pond. CPTs were performed near the Playa 

edge in four regions of the lake. Infiltration test sites were installed and monitored to characterize field scale 

permeability. Soil samples from the test pit program were tested to provide data for future site 

characterization and geotechnical engineering design purposes. A series of laboratory tests were conducted 

on the samples, including index testing, carbonate content, compaction testing, strength testing, consolidation 

testing, and permeability testing. 

The geotechnical investigation data reports from the 2011/2012 and 2013 investigations were intended to 

provide site soil characteristics for the PEA, and for the development of the PFS(CH2M Hill, 2013). 

Additional work was carried out in 2016 as part of the FS field program. The 2016 site investigation was carried 

out by Norwest with field support and laboratory testing provided by IGES. The investigation consisted of test 

pitting, borehole drilling, trench excavations, CPT, and infiltration testing. The laboratory tests conducted on 

the samples consisted of index testing, strength testing, consolidation testing and hydraulic conductivity 

testing. 

Norwest personnel were on-site during major portions of the field program. The field program took place over 

several months, starting in early August 2016 and concluding in early November 2016. The purpose of the 

2016 investigation was to characterize the foundation conditions at Sevier Lake as well as to support feasibility 

level design in the brine trench, pre-concentration, production and tailings storage facility areas. Work was 

also completed to support efforts by other parties on the Processing Plant Facilities. The investigation 

consisted of a field and lab program, and the compiled data resulting from the tests was used in the 

geotechnical foundation model and design specifications for trenches, dykes, and waste dump design. Further 

geotechnical testing is planned during the implementation phase of the Project and will focus on the Plant and 

Facilities sites. 

9.8.3 Sevier River Diversion Assessment 

The Sevier River diversion structure site was evaluated to assess the geotechnical conditions. These tests 

included standard gradations, strength tests, consolidation, etc. for use in seismic design and slope stability 

analyses involved with the study.

ITEM 10: DRILLING 

10.1 Historic Drilling 

The majority of historic drilling was conducted by CPMC between 1979 and 1983 with over 700 auger holes 

completed during that period. The holes extracted lakebed sediments down to a depth of 20 feet 

(6 meters) bgs and the 4.5-inch (11.4-centimeter) diameter holes were cased with 2-inch (5-centimeter) 

diameter slotted PVC pipe to the total depth of each hole. Attempts were made by CPMC to auger every 

quarter section; however, the program was unable to cover the entire Playa before the Project was 

discontinued. Composite samples containing brine and sediment were extracted from those holes and taken 

at 5-foot (1.5-meter) intervals. These sediment and brine samples were used for the following purposes: 

 Mapping of surface crust. 

 Mapping of surface mineral chemistries. 

 Determining sediment mineralogy. 

 Testing of brine geochemistry. 

 Measuring sediment sample water saturation levels. 

 Determining depth and extent of brine within 20 feet (6.1 meters) of the surface. 

 Performing particle size analysis of sediment samples. 

CPMC drilled additional deeper exploration holes, and several additional wells were completed by other 

parties between 2003 and 2008. The past exploration is significant in providing a historical baseline for brine 

chemistry, and for identifying the potential for developing the property into a shallow aquifer SOP operation. 

CPMC considered a validation program that might use the CPMC drill results but determined that a current 

data collection program would provide the accuracy and level of characterization required for current Mineral 

Resource and Reserve reporting. 

10.2 CPM Drilling 

10.2.1 CPM 2011 to 2013 Program 

CPM began planning and implementing its initial drilling program in the spring of 2011, after the federal 

leaseholds were awarded. Exploration permits for the SITLA leases were approved in 2011, and an initial phase 

of exploration drilling commenced on those leases in August of that year to test program methodology, 

procedures, and protocol. The BLM leases were later approved for exploration activities, and drilling 

commenced on those leases in November 2011. A total of 404 exploration holes were drilled on SITLA and 

BLM leases in 2011 and 2012, with drilled penetration totaling 15,866.3 feet (4,757.6 meters). An additional 

10 wells were drilled as vertically-nested well completions on BLM leases bringing the total holes drilled during 

the exploration phase to 414. During the months of February and March 2013, 17 additional mini-sonic 

exploration and infill holes were added on the SITLA and BLM leases bringing the total number of holes to 431, 

with a total of 18,306.4 feet (5,579.8 meters) drilled. 

Exploration holes drilled by CPM from 2011 through 2013 used a combination of direct-push and mini-sonic 

coring techniques. A drill plan was developed using hole spacing of approximately 3,000 feet (900 meters) for 

the federal lease areas. This planned hole spacing was determined after statistical analysis using brine

chemistry data and a preliminary model of select ion concentrations that indicated that 3,000 feet 

(900 meters) and 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) radius from brine sample locations could be used for delineating 

Measured and Indicated assurance areas, respectively. Drilling generally progressed from the south end of the 

Playa northward. 

Statistics for all drilling from 2011 through 2013 are presented in Table ‎10-1 and Table ‎10-2. Locations of the 

various well types are illustrated in Figure ‎10-1. All holes drilled during the CPM program were of vertical 

orientation.

10.2.2 CPM 2015 Drilling Program 

Starting in September 2015, CPM commenced an infill exploration and hydrologically-focused drilling program 

on their BLM and SITLA leases. The primary purpose of the 2015 program was to acquire sufficient geologic 

and hydrologic field data to support a brine-hosted potassium Resource and Reserve estimate in accordance 

with NI 43-101 Technical Report standards. A total of 29 wells were completed between September 10, 2015 

and December 5, 2015. Mini-sonic coring methods were used for the 29 vertically-oriented holes. A total of 12 

of these holes were cored into the top of the hard, dry clay zone representing, at the base of the brine-

saturated SCZ, approximately 79 feet (22.9 meters) bgs. They were targeted as SCZ exploration wells, with a 

primary objective of characterizing the SCZ brine-hosted Mineral Resource and determining the horizon's 

hydrologic properties for Mineral Reserve estimation.

Locations of the 2015 CPM program holes are illustrated in Figure ‎10-2 and a summary breakdown of the 

number of holes and overall purpose is provided in Table ‎10-3. Also, labeled in Figure ‎10-2 are the hole 

identifications for the twin holes used for hydrologic testing. These twin hole depths are not reflected in the 

hole depth summary statics listed in Table ‎10-4.  

Drilling techniques and data collection methodologies were similar to the previous CPM sonic programs. The 

new sonic holes were logged in the field by Norwest geologists. The lithologic core descriptions from these 

field logs, together with moisture content sample results, were used to further delineate brine horizon 

characteristics and the basal surface of the brine Mineral Resource. Brine samples were collected from all 

holes at three different depths in each hole, and core samples from ten of the 2015 holes were selected for 

ICP assay. Additionally, four holes were selected for semi-quantitative XRD to further characterize the 

mineralogical constituents of the Playa sediments. 

10.2.3 CPM Drilling Methods 

10.2.3.1 Direct Push Drilling Method 

Direct-push drilling is a method where the coring tools are "pushed" or percussively driven into the ground; no 

rotation is involved, so all the samples are retrieved uncontaminated from the hole. The main application for 

this method is for drilling various soils, clays and sands, both consolidated and unconsolidated. Direct-push 

holes generally penetrated 50 feet (15 meters), with mechanical refusal typically occurring at the base of the 

marl clay horizon or top of the siliceous clay horizon. Direct-push drilling services were provided by two local 

Salt Lake City area contractors, Direct Push Services, LLC (DPS) and Earthprobe Environmental Field Services, 

Inc. (Earthprobe). DPS provided a Geoprobe 7730DT, while Earthprobe utilized a similar unit, a Geoprobe 

7822DT.

The direct-push rigs completed a 3.26-inch (8.3-centimeter) diameter hole and produced a 2-inch (5.1-

centimeter) diameter soil core in a plastic sample tube. Initially, the core was removed from the plastic sample 

tube and logged at the well site by a Norwest geologist. The majority of the direct-push core samples were not 

removed from the plastic sleeves, but were logged at the well site through the sleeve. Pocket penetrometer 

measurements were taken at core sleeve ends at 2.5 feet (0.8 meter) intervals; the plastic sleeves were then 

labeled with top and bottom depths and sealed at the tubing ends. This procedure was implemented to 

accommodate laboratory moisture content analysis without losing moisture from the core due to generally 

adverse atmospheric conditions at the well site. The core was later opened, photographed and logged in the 

IGES laboratory prior to moisture content analysis. IGES is an independent geotechnical engineering firm and 

rock mechanics laboratory, and is certified with accreditation by the AASHTO Materials Reference Laboratory 

(AMRL). 

In the early stage of exploring the SITLA leases, direct-push holes were completed as wells with 2-inch  

(5.1-centimeter) slotted PVC casing. The majority of the 2011-2012 exploration holes were completed with a 

1-inch (2.5-centimeter) casing to prevent sidewall smearing, but in both instances running slotted casing from 

total depth to within 3 to 10 feet (1 to 3 meters) of the Playa surface. A filter sock was secured to the open-

bottom end of the casing to prevent sediment incursion. A blank casing section was run from the top of the 

screened interval to 2.5 feet (0.8 meters) above the Playa surface. A surface seal was obtained by pushing a 

solid piece of 4-inch (10-centimeter) Schedule 40 PVC through the halite surface crust surrounding the

1-inch (2.5-centimeter) casing to a depth of 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 meter) below the Playa surface, and cement 

was placed in the annular space between the casings. Cementing was discontinued after the initial SITLA 

program since the 4-inch (10.2-centimeter) surface collar was sufficient to prevent surface water 

contamination from the Playa. Figure ‎10-3 and Figure ‎10-4 are photographs showing the installation of casing 

and an example of a completed well from the SITLA program.

10.2.3.2 Sonic Drilling Method 

Sonic drilling employs the use of high-frequency, resonant energy to advance a core barrel without rotation. It 

is used primarily for sampling unconsolidated sediments. The majority of CPM's mini-sonic
2
 drilling was able to 

penetrate all three major brine aquifers to a nominal depth of approximately 85 feet and a maximum depth of 

497 feet (151.5 meters). A LS250™ mini-sonic rig was utilized throughout the CPM sonic programs, due to its 

light weight compared to a full-sized sonic rig. Mini-sonic services for the 2011 to 2013 programs were 

provided by Boart Longyear's environmental division in Salt Lake City, Utah. Cascade Drilling Services of 

Woodinville, Washington, was used for the 2015 operations. 

The mini-sonic rig ran a 6-inch (15.2-centimeter) advancing casing and 4-inch (10.2-centimeter) core barrel 6-

 by 4-inch (15.2 by 10.2 centimeters) configuration, drilling a 6-inch (15.2-centimeter) hole and producing a 

nominal 3.5-inch (8.9-centimeter) core. Three holes, designated for larger-diameter casing and high-volume 

hydrologic pump testing, were drilled as 10-inch (25.4-centimeter) holes and were completed with 6-inch 

(15.2-centimeter) PVC casing. Core samples from the exploration holes were laid out for logging by a Norwest 

geologist; photographed, logged, and tested at intervals with a pocket penetrometer. Moisture content 

samples were removed and sealed. 

The mini-sonic exploration holes were then completed with either 2- or 4-inch (5- or 10-centimeter) slotted 

PVC, depending on whether they were used for pumping or for observation. The sonic holes were completed, 

at a range of targeted horizons, for further hydrologic testing. Planned test wells were gravel packed through 

target intervals and otherwise grouted to the surface. 

10.2.3.3 Field Conditions 

Drilling during the late 2011 and 2012 field season faced some unique challenges in operations and 

transportation of personnel and equipment due to a buildup of surface water at the north end of the Playa. 

This situation was caused by the unusual influx of surface water from the Sevier River. Standing water 

reaching 1 to 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 meter) in depth was present in the north throughout most of the period and 

required the rigs to be mounted on amphibious marsh and cargo buggies with haulage to and from the drill 

locations performed by air boat. Figure ‎10-5 and Figure ‎10-6 portray some of the conveyance methods used 

during this period.

10.3 Summary and Conclusions 

The main objective of the CPM drilling programs was to obtain sufficient samples of the lakebed brine to 

characterize it as a brine Mineral Resource, with potassium concentrations mostly in the Measured plus 

Indicated assurance category for the ultimate objective of defining a brine-hosted potassium Reserve. The 

characterization of the sediments through drilling was done primarily to identify the volume and density of the 

brine-saturated sediments, and to quantify its saturation through moisture content analyses. The drilling 

program is judged to be successful in these objectives after completion of modeling and statistical analysis of 

the acquired data.  

It is the author's opinion that the exploration completed to date is sufficient to estimate brine Mineral 

Resources appropriate for this level of study and to the degree of assurance necessary to form the basis for 

the further reporting of Mineral Reserves.

ITEM 11: SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Overview 

The Project sampling program is separated into the following categories: sediment and brine geochemical 

analysis, brine density and viscosity determination; certain related sediment geomechanical property testing, 

and brine bulk sampling for processing evaluations. Sampling related to metallurgical and process testing is 

discussed in depth in the metallurgical testing ‎Item 13: Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing. 

Sampling during the 2011 through 2015 exploration drilling programs involved both unconsolidated sediment 

core samples, sediment Shelby tube samples, and samples of the liquid brine. Sediment core samples were 

taken primarily to quantify their level of saturation and mineralogy. The Shelby samples were obtained for 

drainable porosity determination and column testing for RBRC, and the brine samples were obtained to 

characterize geochemical composition and brine density. The objective of these sampling efforts was to both 

identify the in-situ Mineral Resource quantity of ions required to produce SOP and associated mineral 

compounds through fractional crystallization and to develop geomechanical and hydrologic parameters for 

use in modeling efforts utilized in Mineral Reserve estimate determination. 

11.2 Sampling Methods and Approach 

11.2.1 Sediment Sampling 

The sediment sampling methodology was developed during the initial 2011 SITLA drilling program and was 

refined prior to the commencement of the main drilling effort that started in November 2011. New 

procedures were implemented in recognition of the need to acquire accurate moisture content and sediment 

density data, minimizing moisture loss to the samples in the field to the greatest possible degree. Sediment 

sampling protocols and procedures were developed and performed by Norwest geologists. Sampling was 

performed in two ways, depending on whether the sample was taken from a direct-push rig or from a sonic 

hole.  

11.2.1.1 Direct Push Core Sampling 

Direct-push core was captured downhole and retained in the plastic sample sleeves. A precursory lithologic 

description was made from the open tube ends and from features visible through the plastic sleeve walls. 

Initially, the tubes were cut in half, each 2.5 feet (0.8 meters) in length. Later, the procedure was modified to 

work with the full, uncut 5-foot (1.6-meter) core section. Core loss was noted and logged where it occurred. 

Field measurements of sediment compaction were taken at the tube ends using a pocket penetrometer and 

were recorded on the core logging forms. 

Immediately after logging, the core tubes were sealed with plastic core caps obtained from the tubing 

manufacturer. Red- and black-colored caps were used to confirm top and bottom of the core run. The caps 

were then sealed with tape and top and bottom depths were marked on the tube in permanent marker. 

Sample identifications were marked on the core tube, and the hole name and depth interval were recorded 

and documented on the well site log and on the chain of custody (COC) form. 

The sealed core was boxed and checked against the COC form. The sealed core boxes were then transported 

directly to the IGES laboratory in Salt Lake City, Utah by Project personnel (predominantly Norwest staff) with

original COC forms that were signed by laboratory personnel on receipt. As noted earlier, IGES is an 

independent geotechnical engineering firm and rock mechanics laboratory and is certified with accreditation 

by the AMRL
3
. 

11.2.1.2 Sonic Core Sampling 

Initially, sampling of Playa sediment, on a sonic rig site, was targeted at providing moisture content data below 

the typical 30 to 50 feet (9.1 to 15.3 meter) range of the direct-push rigs in order to characterize the 

saturation of the SCZ. During this early stage of the sonic program, a 5-foot (1.5-meter) longitudinal slice of 

core was sampled at successive intervals below 50 feet (15 meters) bgs and sealed in one-gallon plastic bags 

that were labeled with unique field-sample identifications. The procedure was modified later in the 2012 and 

2013 programs to acquire 10-foot (3-meter) samples from surface to total depth using methodology described 

previously. For the 2015 program, the procedure reverted back to acquiring 5-foot (1.5-meter) samples from 

surface to total depth using methodology described previously. A number of individual sample bags, 

approximately 10 to a group, were then double-sealed in a Lexan sonic core tube, labeled, and transported to 

the IGES laboratory.  

Shelby tube sampling for hydrologic and sediment composition analysis was added as part of the 2015 drilling 

program. This included selecting representative strata from which to obtain undisturbed samples via the 

Shelby tube for the duel purposes of determining specific yield (drainable porosity) of the various Playa strata 

as well as determining the RBRC of the various sediments through column testing. Column tests were 

performed by GSH of Salt Lake City, Utah, and were used in determining the quantity of un-drained brine that 

could be liberated through the introduction of fresh water into the previously freely-drained sediment 

column. 

In all instances, final transportation of the samples to the appropriate laboratory was performed by Project 

personnel, predominantly Norwest staff members, with direct COC sign-off at the laboratory. 

11.2.2 Brine Sampling 

The brine sampling procedures and protocols from exploration holes were developed by CH2M, in 

consultation with CPMC and Norwest, as part of their role as project consultants responsible for the sample 

well installations and further hydrologic characterization of the brine aquifer. CH2M personnel performed 

brine sampling after the well installation was completed and after a minimum 48-hour stabilization period had 

elapsed. Prior to sampling, the water level and total well depth were documented using an electronic 

sounding tape. Low-flow peristaltic pumps were used for sampling the wells. The wells were purged prior to 

sampling. Polyethylene tubing, attached to a weight, was lowered down the well to specified depths. Because 

the intention was to collect samples representative of conditions after re-equilibration and to minimize 

disturbance of the water column, the wells were sampled with the minimal amount of purging deemed 

necessary. 

 The procedure for purging and sampling included the following instructions: 

o Slowly lower a peristaltic pump tube to the uppermost sampling interval. 

o Purge the well at a flow rate of between approximately 0.02 and 0.11 gal/ft (100 and 500 mL/m).

o Purge until the turbidity has visually improved, not to exceed 15 minutes (note that the upper 

interval is often fairly clean and the necessary purge time is often less than 15 minutes). 

o Collect samples at the same flow rate of between 0.02 and 0.11 gal/ft (100 and 500 mL/m). 

o Lower the pump tubing to the next sampling interval and repeat the above steps (note that for 

most direct-push wells, there were generally two sampling intervals). 

For wells where it was suspected that a volume greater than approximately 1 gallon (3.78 liters) of surface 

water may have entered the top of the well boring or casing during drilling and well construction, additional 

well purging was performed before sampling with the peristaltic pump. At least two borehole volumes were 

purged from these wells using a submersible pump. To minimize clogging of the filter pack material and 

collapse of formation around the filter sock and well screen, pump rates no greater than approximately 1 gpm 

(3.8 L/m) were used. After this purging, the well was allowed to re-equilibrate for at least 24 hours before 

sampling according to the peristaltic pump procedures above, or after the well had returned to 90% of its 

initial volume (not exceeding 48 hours from purging). 

At the beginning of the 2011 program, samples were collected at approximate 25-foot (7.6-meter) intervals, 

with at least three intervals sampled in each well. Later, during the 2012 program, the number of intervals was 

reduced since review of the assay results showed low variability of the brine column. The nominal 50-foot 

(15.2-meter) direct-push wells were then sampled at two horizons, typically at depths of 10 and 35 feet (3 to 

10.7 meters). The sonic holes drilled on the LUMA leases during the 2013 program, were sampled at one 

depth within the respective well's screened interval. Sample intervals for the 2015 program were increased 

back to three samples per hole located typically 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters) apart in the top, middle, and 

bottom half of the screened intervals. Duplicate samples were also collected as part of the Quality 

Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program. 

11.3 Sample Preparation, Handling, and Security 

11.3.1 Sediment Samples 

Sample preparation and security for sediment samples is discussed previously in Section ‎11.2.1: Sediment 

Sampling. 

11.3.2 Brine Samples 

Sample preparation, handling, and security protocol for brine samples was designed by CH2M, with the 

collaboration of CPMC and Norwest. Samples were collected in two 8.4535-ounce (250-milliliter) bottles for a 

total sample volume of 0.11 gallons (500 milliliters). The cation sample bottles contained nitric acid to 

preserve metal speciation, and the anion bottles contained no preservative. The samples were labeled 

according to the well, depth interval, date, and time. 

Blind field duplicates were submitted, at the rate of one per 10 samples, as part of the programs QA/QC 

measures. Brine samples collected during the 2011 to 2013 campaigns were sent to AWAL, an independent 

laboratory located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Brine samples collected during the 2015 campaign were sent to ALS. 

For internal QC, both laboratories ran method blanks, laboratory control samples, and Matrix Spike/Matrix 

Spike Duplicates (MS/MSDs), at the rate of one per 20 samples for AWAL and one per four samples for ALS. 

The internal QC programs were necessary to conform to National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation

Program (NELAP) certification. For external QC, six brine check samples were sent to SGS during the 2015 

campaign, an independent laboratory located in Denver, Colorado. 

All samples were kept in portable coolers and iced to maintain a temperature between 32°F (0°C) and 42.8°F 

(6°C). Samples remained in the sole possession of the sampler until delivered to AWAL/ALS or securely stored 

to prevent tampering. COC forms were used to document the handling of the samples, custody seals were 

placed on the cooler lids, and the coolers were wrapped with security tape to discourage unauthorized 

handling of the samples. Final transportation and delivery of the samples to AWAL/ALS was performed by 

CH2M or Norwest samplers who obtained direct COC sign-off at the laboratory. Iced containers were used to 

ship the checked samples overnight to the SGS Colorado facility. 

11.4 Analytical Program 

The selected analytical program for brine Mineral Resource determination was primarily focused on 

measuring the gravimetric moisture (water) content of the sediments samples, the concentrations of five 

major ions in the brine, and brine SG. The suite of five major ions included:  

 Potassium (K
+
)  

 Magnesium (Mg
2+

)  

 Sodium (Na
+
)  

 Chloride (Cl
-
)  

 Sulfate (SO4
2-

)  

Additional measurement of physical parameters relevant to the brine Mineral Resource evaluations included 

sediment carbonate content, solid particle specific gravity, direct measurement of sediment porosity and 

sediment mineralogy. Brine from selected holes underwent a more extensive suite of tests for other minerals 

of potential economic interest, including lithium, bromine, and boron.  

Analytical methods for these parameters are discussed below. 

11.4.1 Sediment Gravimetric Moisture Content 

Sediment samples were analyzed by IGES for water content in accordance with American Society for Testing 

and Materials (ASTM) Standard D2216, which is the determination of water content by reduction in mass by 

drying. Due to the quantity of gypsum identified in the sediments, the modified temperature of 140°F (60°C) 

was used in the drying process instead of the normal, higher-drying temperature of 230°F (110°C). This is done 

in instances where hydrous minerals, such as gypsum, render their hydrous component as water at the higher 

testing temperature, thus skewing the reported water content. Analysis of water content data at both 

temperatures was compared for splits of the first sediment samples to be processed and showed the higher 

drying temperature yielded an average moisture content 3% higher than the lower temperature. The lower 

temperature results were used in the Mineral Resource model dataset.

11.4.2 Brine Geochemical Analysis 

Analyses of brine sampled from the Playa wells were performed by AWAL at its Salt Lake City Facility from 

2011 to 2013. Brine sample analyses sampled from the wells in 2015 were performed by ALS at their own Salt 

Lake City facility. AWAL and ALS laboratories are accredited by NELAP and all analyses were performed in 

accordance with NELAP Institute protocols. The laboratories were engaged by CPM, on a contractual basis, 

and are independent of CPM. 

Duplicate brine samples were prepared by CH2M for the 2012/2013 programs for internal check assays, and 

by Norwest in the 2015 program for external laboratory testing at SGS. A total of 861 unique brine analyses 

had been completed as part of the Playa exploration and were used in the Mineral Resource model. Of these 

samples, an additional 85 blind duplicate samples were completed by AWAL and another six blind duplicate 

samples were completed by ALS and SGS, in 2015. These blind duplicate analyses were not used in the Mineral 

Resource modeling data set. 

Table ‎11-1 lists the analyses included in the CPM analytical program for brine Mineral Resource estimation.

Comparison of original AWAL samples to AWAL blind field duplicates shows a slight, but acceptable, range of 

deviation for potassium assays, as illustrated in Figure ‎11-1. The area of greatest difference is in the higher 

potassium levels possibly exhibiting a slight nugget effect at these higher concentrations. This may be caused 

by the logistics of obtaining a repeat sample of a liquid material as opposed to a solid. The repeatability, 

however, is generally good with a coefficient of determination (R
2
) of 0.84.

Figure ‎11-1: Brine Analyses and Methods 

 

 

Figure ‎11-2, showing brine chemistry QA/QC charts, compares blind duplicate results completed at ALS and 

SGS, with the original ALS test results. There is reasonable repeatability of sample results; however, there are 

some notable differences with respect to sulfate, sodium and specific gravity test results. An explanation for 

these differences in results is due to the potential for precipitation of salts in the sample bottles during 

transport from the field to the laboratories and during sample storage. In addition, minor brine turbulence in 

the well from the use of a peristaltic pump may result in inconsistencies in concentration of major ions 

between collecting the original and blind duplicate samples. Given the potential for precipitation of salts 

between field sampling and testing, and the possibility for brine turbulence during field samplings, the 

repeatability of the brine chemistry test results is interpreted to be reasonable.  

11.4.3 Sediment Carbonate Content 

Expressed as a percentage of samples, the carbonate content of the sediment samples has been tested by 

IGES using ASTM Standard D4373, the geometric method for the rapid determination of carbonate content of 

soils. Carbonate content testing was performed in 2012 by IGES, on 97 direct-push and trench samples in 2012 

by IGES. The average carbonate content (calcite equivalent) for these samples was 41% (Green & Seely, 2012) 

appeared to indicate a decrease in carbonate content with depth. The carbonate content for 132 samples 

extracted from surface to total depth in 13 exploration holes was tested in 2015 to determine any significant 

change in sediment geochemistry between the three main brine aquifers (FCZ, MCZ, and SCZ).

11.4.4 Solid Particle Density 

Sediment particle density measurements were undertaken by IGES in accordance with ASTM Standard D2216 

for the purposes of calculating the porosity of the brine-saturated clay aquifers. A total of 43 core samples 

representing a reasonable spatial and lithologic spread across the Playa were subjected to particle density 

measurements.  

11.4.5 Sediment Porosity Measurements 

Direct measurement of sediment porosity from 18 Shelby tube core samples taken during the 2015 hydrologic 

testing program were undertaken by IGES, in accordance with ASTM Standard D2216. These porosity 

measurements were used to validate the sediment porosity calculations used for brine Mineral Resource 

determinations, as well as for estimating the sediment RBRC of sediments for brine Mineral Reserve 

determinations.

11.4.6 Sediment Mineralogy Testing 

Six clay core samples, collected by CH2M in 2012, were sent to the Terra Tek LLC, an independent testing 

laboratory (now a division of Schlumberger Limited) in Salt Lake City, Utah, for determination of basic 

sediment mineralogy. A total of 82 core samples collected by Norwest in 2015 were sent to DCM
4
 , an 

independent laboratory in Wheat Ridge, Colorado for the same purpose. Both laboratories performed XRD 

mineralogical analysis on the submitted core samples. The core samples were selected from holes 

representing a reasonable spatial and lithologic spread across the Playa and were analyzed from surface 

through total depth. The purpose of mineralogical analysis was to gain an understanding of potentially 

important characteristics of the Playa sediments of relevance to both the brine Mineral Resource and brine 

Mineral Reserve, which include: 

 Varying hydrologic properties of the host sediments based on mineralogy. 

 Potential correlation of varying levels of permeability based on mineralogy. 

 Presence of clay minerals with high potassium contents for estimation of solute transport potential. 

 Geotechnical parameters with respect to trench and dyke stability. 

 Potential brine leakage rates from solar evaporation ponds. 

The results of the mineralogical testing program are discussed in ‎Item 13: Mineral Processing and 

Metallurgical Testing. 

11.4.7 SRC ICP Testing 

Sediment samples from 10 holes drilled during the 2013 program were also analyzed, primarily using ICP 

methodology, for a comprehensive suite of metals and mineral compounds at the Saskatchewan Research 

Council (SRC). SRC's Geoanalytical Laboratory is a respected laboratory in potash and related minerals due to 

its working relationship with Canada's large potash deposits. The results indicated that the sediments contain 

no current economically recoverable minerals; however, the analyzed sediments exhibit levels of potassium 

and sulfate that may support mineral recharge of circulating groundwater through leaching.  

The author is satisfied that the sampling methodology, protocols and preparation employed during the various 

drilling campaigns are of high standards and presented representative samples into the analytical component 

of the programs. After review of the original analytical data and blind brine sample comparisons, the author is 

of the opinion that the analytical methods used by ALS and IGES are satisfactory for determination of the brine 

geochemistry, especially for the cation concentrations that determine the quantity and quality of Mineral 

Resources and Reserves. Some adjustments to anion concentrations were required to establish proper ion 

balance in the samples, as described in ‎Item 14: Mineral Resource Estimates, but these are not considered 

material to the estimation of K2SO4 Resources and Reserves. The moisture content and sediment density 

analyses performed by IGES are believed to be of sufficient accuracy for the determination of in-place brine 

volume for the purposes of the FS. Security measures are found to be of a high standard and do not 

compromise the results used in this technical evaluation.

ITEM 12: DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Qualified Person Data Verification 

As defined by NI 43-101 and related companion documents, an independent QP has been responsible for the 

oversight of data collection, analysis, QA/QC procedures and results, data modeling and interpretation, and 

the procedures and methodologies involved in producing the Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates 

presented in this Technical Report. As stated in their Certificates of Qualification, each QP as required has 

performed a site visit to the Project site, with some QPs visiting the site numerous times throughout the 

course of Project development. Each QP has taken the responsibility for data verification in each of the 

sections specified in the introduction to this Technical Report. The data verification procedures employed, the 

existence of any known limitations to the data employed, and the QP's opinion on the adequacy of the data 

are presented in the following discussion. 

12.2 Project QA/QC 

12.2.1 Drilling and Sampling Methods 

Norwest geologists, under the direct supervision of the QP for Mineral Resources, have been active in assisting 

CPM with its Sevier Playa field drilling and sampling programs starting on August 1, 2011, and ending with the 

last campaign of Mineral Resource drilling in December 2016. During that period, the QP for Mineral 

Resources observed the field data collection procedures, which included drilling methods, core logging, 

multiple methods of sediment sampling and handling, and borehole brine sampling and handling. Additionally, 

Norwest personnel assisted in the transportation of the sediment samples from the Project site to laboratories 

located in Salt Lake City, Utah. The locations of 25% of the drill holes were independently verified in-situ by 

Norwest field geologist using a handheld GPS device. 

12.2.2 Surface Mapping 

Norwest evaluated the Playa boundary mapping completed by Sunrise Engineering in April 2011 and used the 

Playa boundary sourced from the public domain AGRC website (AGRC.utah.gov) in the geologic model. The 

CPM-mapped Playa boundary tracked the AGRC boundary without any materially-significant differences. 

There was only a 0.7% difference in the Playa area between the AGRC data and the CPM-mapped boundary. 

The initial Playa boundary used in the prior Technical Reports and Mineral Resource estimates was compared 

with the 2015 Aero-Graphics LiDAR survey data and was found to be very closely aligned with significant 

topographic change evident where surrounding non-Playa terrain transitions into the relatively flat Playa 

surface between 4,528- and 4,534-feet (1380- and 1382-meter) elevation AMSL.  

All Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates outlined in this Technical Report are limited to within the same 

Playa boundary as outlined in the 2013 PFS report with minor adjustments made based on the 2015 LiDAR 

survey.

12.2.3 Database 

All field exploration data were entered into Microsoft Excel worksheets onsite or at lodging near the Project. 

Norwest was actively involved in compiling field data on a daily basis as field activities progressed. Assay data 

received from the respective laboratories were supplied in digital and printed form and were reviewed by 

project personnel. Comparisons were conducted by Norwest between the digital and printed assay certificates 

and no errors or omissions were observed. Where several instances of possible errata in the data were 

identified, the laboratories quickly confirmed or corrected the suspect values. Both field and laboratory data 

were integrated into a single Excel database that was used for statistical validation, geostatistical analysis, 

geologic modeling, and ultimately for the estimation of Mineral Resources and in the Mineral Reserve 

determination process. 

12.2.4 Brine Analyses 

The two primary brine testing facilities, AWAL and ALS laboratories, have their own internal QA/QC 

procedures. As required for NELAC certification, these laboratories complete method blanks, laboratory 

control samples, and MS/MSDs, at the rate of one per 20 samples. Common control limits for the relative 

percent difference is ±20% or ± the reporting limit. 

Norwest selected SGS as the independent laboratory for analyzing the brine check samples from the 2015 

drilling and sampling program. Reasonable repeatability of sample results between SGS and the primary 

laboratory (ALS) was observed. For external QA/QC during the 2011 through 2013 exploration programs, blind 

field duplicates were submitted at the rate of 1 per 10 samples and no significant deviation of repeatability 

was observed.  

12.2.5 Sediment Analyses 

The sediment sampling facilities at IGES laboratories employ their own internal QA/QC procedures. The 

relatively low-nugget effect observed in the geostatistical analysis of their sample results indicated that the 

sample values are repeatable within laboratory detection limits. Splitting of sediment samples for duplicate 

testing was determined to be impractical due to the unconsolidated nature of the sample material. 

Comparison between the sediment moisture content reported from IGES with drill core field logs did not yield 

any contradictory results. For example, low moisture content samples were described as either dry or only 

slightly moist in field logs.  

12.2.6 Bulk Sample versus Exploration Drilling 

Comparison between bulk sample test results with average brine tested from surrounding exploration wells 

yielded similar results, particularly for anions (Na
+
, Mg

2+
, K

+
). The largest deviation in analytical values 

occurred in the sulfate and chloride (cation) results. Both of these analytes were determined by ion 

chromatography at AWAL and ALS laboratories, as opposed to the more repeatable barium precipitation 

method used by Hazen for bulk sample testing. Since potassium is the key element concentration controlling 

in-situ Mineral Resource quantity (sulfate occurs in quantities over six times the amount required for SOP 

crystallization), the effects of these variations are deemed to be insignificant to the Mineral Resource estimate 

for SOP. However, adjustments to sulfate and chloride concentrations were made by Norwest for an improved 

ion balance between cation and anion concentrations overall.

12.2.7 Data Adequacy for the Determination of Mineral Resources and Reserves 

Norwest QPs, and staff under their supervision, were directly involved with the majority of data collection that 

forms the basis of Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates disclosed in this Technical Report. All reasonable 

attempts have been made to assure that the data utilized in these estimates is accurate and does not 

misrepresent the quantities or grades of potassium sulfate components occurring in-place within the Playa, or 

that which might be reasonably expected to be extracted for delivery to the solar evaporation pond system. 

Further validation of data utilized in the estimation of recoverable SOP from the solar evaporation ponds and 

of marketable product after processing has been performed by the Novopro QPs and the staff under their 

supervision. The author is of the opinion that the base data used in the determination of Mineral Resource 

and Reserve estimates, included in this Report, are of sufficient adequacy and accuracy for the purposes of 

this Report. No limitations constrained the authors in the determination of the Mineral Resource and Reserve 

estimates presented herein.

ITEM 13: MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The design of the overall process was developed through using computer modeling, and integrated the results 

of both a field testing program and a bench-scale testwork program. These testwork programs were executed 

to confirm the operating parameters of the main unit operations, including: 

 Pond evaporation field program 

 Pond chemistry and precipitation of salts field program 

 Conversion testing 

 Flotation testing 

 Mineral leach testing 

 SOP crystallization testing  

13.1 Bench-Scale Program 

The various test data obtained from the laboratory bench-scale testwork program allowed for the definition of 

the main process parameters such as: 

 Conversion: extent of reaction, and residence time and temperature. 

 Flotation: grade and recovery, conditioning time, flotation time, reagents dosage, circuit 

configuration. 

 Mineral leach: extent of reaction and residence time. 

 SOP crystallization: water-to-feed ratio, extent of reaction (crystallization rate) and reaction time. 

 MOP addition: conversion ratio, maximum addition rate. 

Execution of the testwork program and the process development were interactive processes that led to the 

development of Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs). As the testwork program and modeling progressed, the 

addition of MOP into the SOP crystallization system was also introduced and tested.  

The conversion testwork confirmed that the incoming salts from the harvest ponds could be converted into a 

single potassium-bearing salt. The testwork also concluded that the conversion reaction and circuit can 

successfully operate at multiple temperatures.  

Flotation testwork confirmed that a suite of reagents can effectively beneficiate potassium-bearing solids from 

gangue material. Further to this, optimal reagent dosages were developed, as well as optimal flotation time. 

The recovery is acceptable. 

Mineral leach testwork confirmed the concentrate generated through flotation can be purified to contain 

potassium-bearing salts that can then be sent to the SOP crystallization system.  

The crystallization process was tested in both semi-continuous and batch reactions where the main 

parameters studied included the water-to-potassium-mineral ratio and the impact of MOP addition on this 

ratio. During the crystallization testwork, the optimal water-to-potassium-mineral ratio was determined to 

allow for optimum SOP crystallizer recovery. Furthermore, the addition of MOP to the SOP crystallization 

system was successfully demonstrated in the testing program to increase the SOP crystallizer recovery.  

All of the bench-scale testwork was performed at Hazen Research Inc. in Golden, Colorado.

13.2 Process Modeling 

METSIM™ and PHREEQC™ modeling tools were used for design development on the process and to tie 

together all the unit operations. The process unit operations were modeled in METSIM™ to determine the 

flow rates as well as the process mass balance. This included all the main process sections: evaporation ponds, 

harvest ponds, conversion, flotation, mineral leach, SOP crystallization, and MOP addition. PHREEQC™ and 

METSIM™ models for the Project can be seen in Figure ‎13-1.  

The phase chemistry data in METSIM™ was deemed not accurate enough by itself to support the design of the 

process since it does not include all of the phase equilibria present in the process. The Project includes a 

number of different brines and various reactions involving different sulfate salts and different operating 

temperatures. For this reason, the PHREEQC™ software was used for all of the phase chemistry calculations as 

well as to simulate the brine reactions throughout the process. By inputting the different brine compositions 

and mixtures in the software, all the brine chemistry reactions within each unit operation could be predicted. 

These events include: salts precipitation in the ponds, conversion of chloride potassium salts to sulfate 

potassium salts, mineral leach, tailings leach, and SOP crystallization. The results from PHREEQC™ were tested 

during the testwork phase and found to be accurate representations of the salt systems. Adjustments to the 

models were made based on the testwork data obtained. Data obtained by the modeling with PHREEQC™ was 

used as inputs for the METSIM™ model. The METSIM™ model was then used to model all the unit operations, 

with input from PHREEQC™ for the equilibrium values, to generate a mass balance on the entire process. All 

the unit operations were modeled, and the impacts of the recycle streams were studied due to the capabilities 

of the METSIM™ software. This enabled the generation of the mass balance for the entire process. 

Furthermore, the chemistry and mineralogy in the ponds were determined by correlating the brine 

evaporation data from the Gwynn (2006) report with the PHREEQC™ software data.

13.3 Field Test Programs 

The field tests performed for the Project aimed at gathering evaporation rate and brine chemistry data. Two 

field test programs were carried out: the pan evaporation program and the pilot pond program. 

13.3.1 Pan Evaporation Testing 

The objective of the on-site pan evaporation testing was to measure the evaporation rates of brines at 

different concentrations as well as fresh water evaporation. This was performed by using evaporation pans in 

a controlled setting and measuring the amount of water evaporated at a specified measuring interval. 

Evaporation rates of brines were measured by filling the pans with a brine of known composition to a fixed 

level in the pan and then periodically refilling the pan with fresh water back to the fixed level. The data 

gathered was then used to generate an evaporation rate curve that was used for pond modeling purposes. 

13.3.1.1 Test Pans Set-up 

Six pans in total were tested, with five pans on the south Playa and one pan on the north Playa. The locations 

of the pans were chosen based on accessibility of the site from a pre-existing road. These pans included one 

fresh water pan on both the north and south Playa and four brine pans on the south Playa with various brine 

concentrations. The pans that contained fresh water were used to compare the fresh water evaporation rate 

between the south and the north Playa.

All pans used for this program were standard Class A evaporation pans. The fresh water pans were installed 

above ground on wood pallets, with the remaining four pans recessed 8 inches (20.3 centimeters) into the 

ground. Water and brine levels in the pans were determined using a stillwell. Bird guards were placed on the 

fresh water pans to prevent any wildlife from drinking the water in the pans. The evaporation measurement 

station also included a rain gauge and shaded ambient air thermometer that recorded daily minimum and 

maximum temperatures. Photographs of the setup are shown in Figure ‎13-2 and Figure ‎13-3.

13.3.1.2 Modeling Evaporation Rate Curve  

The site evaporation curve for the Project location was estimated from historical evaporation data for the 

areas surrounding the Playa, in association with David Butts, a specialist in evaporation pond modeling. 

Evaporation data gathered for the period of October 2016 to May 2017 was used in June 2017 to update the 

Project evaporation rate curve. The evaporation rate curve, based on historical data and evaporation data 

from the Playa from November 2016 to May 2017, is presented in Figure ‎13-4.

13.3.2 Pilot Pond Campaign  

The objective of the pilot pond program was to produce pond solids representative of the salts that will be 

produced in the commercial operation as well as to test and validate the brine concentration path under field 

conditions. The pilot pond program was developed to be as close as possible to the commercial ponds 

conditions to produce salts that would be similar to commercial pond salts. The campaign was designed to 

capture one complete evaporation season. Monitoring the brine concentration path during the program 

provided information about the evaporation pathway of the brine as well as details on the brine chemistry 

during evaporation. The four pilot ponds were located at the southern end of the Playa, and were labelled 

sequentially P1, H1, H2 and H3 for Pre-Concentration Pond 1, Harvest Pond 1, Harvest Pond 2, and Harvest 

Pond 3.

The first and largest pond was used as a pre-concentration pond (P1), where predominantly halite 

precipitated, while the harvest ponds were used to precipitate combinations of various potassium-bearing 

minerals, magnesium sulfate, and halite. Just over one million gallons [3,785.4 m
3
] of brine sourced directly 

from a trench developed on the Playa was used in the pilot pond program. Brine was allowed to evaporate in 

the pre-concentration pond up to potassium saturation. The brine was transferred sequentially to the 

subsequent ponds based upon the target brine composition. Once the brine was at the target, the brine was 

transferred to the next pond. Figure ‎13-5 and Figure ‎13-6 show Pilot Ponds operations.

The H1 and H2 ponds were drained and salt was harvested using a small loader with low pressure tracks. 

The salt pile was transferred into 55-gallon (0.2-m

) drums.

Pond H3 was harvested without being drained in order to avoid precipitating minerals from additional water 

evaporation from the brine. A total of 75 drums of pilot salts were recovered. They will be used for further 

process testwork in the next phase of the Project. 

13.3.3 Field Test Conclusions 

Evaporation pan data collected and analyzed up to May 2017 was used to produce a more accurate site 

evaporation rate curve. The remaining evaporation data collected from June 2017 to October 2017 will be 

analyzed in the Bridge Engineering Phase to further improve the accuracy of the site evaporation curve. 

The pilot pond program demonstrated that, under field evaporation conditions, the brine may require more 

evaporation within the ponds to reach the desired potassium recovery. The evaporation area of the 

production ponds would have to be increased by 8% to meet this additional evaporation load. This potential 

increase in area was not integrated into the design, but instead was captured and monetized as a potential 

source of risk in the Project. The pilot pond program generated sufficient potassium-bearing salts to allow 

further phases of the Project to conduct additional testing on more realistic salts, as required. As the pilot 

ponds were operated in a batch process and did not include the process recycle brine as in the commercial 

design, the salts produced slightly differed from that predicted by the commercial model. Qualitative mineral 

analysis results confirmed that the minerals precipitated in the pilot ponds were in agreement with the 

minerals predicted in the commercial pond model and expected in the commercial pond operations. 

The impact of brine chemistry on pond design should be revisited following a thorough review of the pilot 

pond data in the pilot ponds and pans report. This Report should include the analysis of the complete 

evaporation data, a comparison of the evaporation between the north and south Playa, and a quantitative 

analysis of the minerals in the pond salts. This analysis will enable the completion of the pond design by 

providing more accurate data on the mineralization of solids expected in the ponds and more accurate 

evaporation rates and will be conducted in the Bridge Engineering phase of the Project.

ITEM 14: MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Overview 

The brine Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by Norwest's Project Manager, Derek Loveday, P.Geo., Pr 

Sci. Nat.; under the supervision of Norwest's Vice President Geologic Services, Lawrence Henchel, P.Geo., PG. 

Mr. Henchel is the QP responsible for the Mineral Resource estimate. 

Brine occurrences are not "solid mineral deposits," as defined under the CIM definition standards (Canadian 

Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, 2003). However, there are sufficient similarities to mineral 

deposits that the guidelines published by CIM and referenced in NI 43-101 and related best practice addenda 

to provide a guide to brine estimation reporting. Norwest used the principle of the NI 43-101 disclosure 

standards, and the format of Form NI 43-101F1 in preparing this Technical Report disclosing Mineral Resource 

estimates, and considered recommendations in CIM best practice guidelines for lithium brines
5
 (Canadian 

Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, 2012), specifically the application of specific yield values for 

reporting potentially extractable brine quantities, in the preparation of the estimates. 

The brine Mineral Resource estimate was developed using Carlson
©

 and MineSight® modeling software. The 

geological model from which the brine Mineral Resources are reported is based on the analyses and 

descriptions of brine and aquifer sediment samples taken at regular depth intervals from vertically-oriented 

drill holes collared on the Playa surface. 

The Mineral Resource estimates define the quantity of in-situ brine within the aquifers as well as the 

concentration of major ions in the brine available for extraction and delivery to the solar evaporation pond 

system via surface trenches and Production Wells. The Mineral Resource estimates further define the 

likelihood of extraction by applying recovery factors in the form of an estimated value for specific yield from 

each aquifer. Past Mineral Resource estimates for the Project have reported in-place Mineral Resource values 

only, as the hydrologic data required for estimates of specific yield were still being developed. Best practice 

guidelines adopted by the CIM for the reporting of Mineral Resources from lithium brines (Canadian Institute 

of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, 2012) eventually established the concept of applying estimated specific 

yield values to the in-place brine Mineral Resource quantities, representing what might be potentially 

extractable by gravity drainage.  

It is important to recognize that the method of applying specific yield to the in-place Mineral Resource does 

not account for the introduction of recharge water contemplated through the mine development process at 

the Project, nor does it consider the effects of mass transfer. For these reasons, the potentially extractable 

Mineral Resources do not include the additional potassium that becomes available through the tonnage 

produced in the recharge and mass transfer processes that are considered a part of the Mineral Reserve.  

The recovery of the available brine from trenches and Production Wells is described and defined under the 

Mineral Reserve estimates presented in ‎Item 15: Mineral Reserve Estimates; and the extraction methods are 

further described in ‎Item 16: Mining Methods.

And associated extractable minerals contained in brines.

14.2 Model Database 

The geologic model database comprises three components— drill hole data, topography, and surface 

mapping. Each component is described in the discussion that follows. 

14.2.1 Drill Hole Data 

The following principal brine Mineral Resource parameters were acquired from drill hole sampling of brine and 

host sediments: 

 Lithologic observations 

 Sediment carbonate content 

 Penetrometer measurements  

 Gravimetric moisture content  

 Specific gravity (SG) of brine and host sediments 

 Cation content in brine for ions magnesium (Mg
+2

), sodium (Na
+
) and potassium (K

+
) 

 Anion content in brine for ions chloride (Cl
-
) and sulfate (SO4

-2
) 

Each of the above principal Mineral Resource parameters are discussed below, with a number of the 

parameters having been graphically illustrated in Section 7.4: Playa Stratigraphy, Figure ‎7-5. 

14.2.2 Lithologic Observations 

Field observations of drill cores were used to identify three brine-saturated Mineral Resource horizons, or 

brine aquifers. These zones are identified, with increasing depth from surface, as the FCZ, MCZ, and SCZ. 

Underlying these three main horizons is a dry, hard clay that is excluded in the geologic model as a contributor 

to the brine Mineral Resource estimates. The number of partial and complete penetrations of the three brine 

aquifers and univariate thickness statistics interpreted from drill hole records are outlined in Table ‎14-1. These 

three brine aquifers are described in detail in Section 7.4: Playa Stratigraphy.

14.2.3 Sediment Carbonate Content 

Carbonate content of the sediment samples, expressed as a weight percentage of the sample, has been tested 

for 222 sediment core samples. The significant decrease in carbonate content from approximately 45% in the 

FCZ and MCZ to approximately 30% for the SCZ is consistent with changes in drill core lithology from marl-like

clays to siliceous clay, at approximately 30 feet (9.1 meters) from the surface. The carbonate content, though 

not used directly in the estimation of brine Mineral Resources, is an important sediment chemistry marker in 

both validating and identifying the gradational change from a marl clay aquifer to a siliceous clay aquifer. 

14.2.4 Penetrometer Measurements 

The penetrometer results provided an indirect and relative field measure of moisture content. The lower 

values, ranging from (0 to 2 st/ft
2
 [2 kg/cm

2
]) generally represented intervals of elevated moisture content. 

The higher values of (2 st/ft
2
 [2 kg/cm

2
]) and above generally represented intervals of low moisture content of 

approximately 30 wt% or less. Penetrometer results, together with lithologic descriptions, were used for field 

assessment of relative moisture content and corroboration of assayed values prior to modeling. Penetrometer 

measurements, along with lithologic descriptions and carbonate content, were used to determine the 

transition from the MCZ to SCZ, and to delineate the bottom of the total brine aquifer at the base of the SCZ. 

14.2.5 Moisture Content 

The gravimetric moisture content was measured for all sediment samples and is considered to be an 

equivalent measure of porosity given that all Playa sediment samples were observed to be 100% saturated. 

The univariate statistics for modeled moisture content are listed in Table ‎14-2.

14.2.6 Specific Gravity 

SG of the brine was measured for all brine samples following the cation and anion analyses. The dry SG of the 

host sediments was not determined for all samples and was limited to a representative group randomly 

distributed across the property. The univariate statistics for laboratory values for brine and sediment SG is 

listed in Table ‎14-3.

The laboratory-determined brine SG was identified to be varying significantly when compared to 

concentration of major ions such as sodium, as evidenced from Figure ‎14-1, depicting a scatter plot of brine 

SG versus sodium content. Furthermore, the lowest brine SG value reported from laboratory assays, reflected 

in the minimum value in Table ‎14-3, is slightly less than 1.0, less than pure water without any dissolved solids. 

These results were discussed with the laboratories. After repeat assay checks, it was jointly concluded that the 

high variability in brine SG values was due to laboratory testing method precision limitations and/or possible 

precipitation of salts between measurement of major ion concentrations and the SG analyses.  

To improve the accuracy of the SG measurements, and knowing that halite (NaCl) is by far the primary salt 

that precipitates out of solution from the brine, it was determined that the concentration of Na
+
 in brine be 

used to calculate a theoretical SG. In doing so, the brine SG would increase in linear proportion to the Na 

concentration of brine. Equation 14.1 was used to calculate SG from sodium: 

      
         

          
             (14.1) 

Where: 

BSGC = brine specific gravity (calculated) 

Na
+
 = sodium concentration in brine in mg/L 

The formula above was derived from salometer reference charts (Alkar RapidPak, Inc., 2017) where measured 

SG of brine is compared with the corresponding Na
+
 concentration in halite at 60

o
F (15.5

o
C). The univariate 

statistics for calculated brine SG are listed in the second row of Table ‎14-3 and indicate a slight overall 

increase in brine SG values. The distribution of calculated versus laboratory-determined brine SG results is 

illustrated in scatter plot of brine SG versus sodium content.

+
 versus SG

14.2.7 Cation and Anion Analyses 

The purpose of measuring the most commonly occurring cations and anions in the brine samples is for use in 

determining the theoretical salt products, including potash as either potassium sulfate or potassium chloride 

that could be precipitated from brine in solar evaporation ponds. The major ions used to determine the 

theoretical salt products from the Mineral Resource are cations: K
+
, Mg

+2
, Na

+
; and anions: Cl

-
 and SO4

-2
. 

Ancillary elements are present, but in very low concentrations relative to these five primary salt-forming 

elements.  

The ratio of total cations to anions, referred to as the ion balance, was identified in many brine samples from 

the exploration drill hole data set to be outside the expected ion balance range when using environmental 

water sample standards as a reference. Industry guidelines suggest that an ion balance ratio (cations-to-

anions) for water samples should be between 0.95 and 1.05 relative to a median standard of 1.00. Prior to 

modeling, adjustments to the reported anion concentrations were deemed necessary to ensure that the 

cation-anion balance fell within an acceptable range for accurate downstream modeling of salt concentrations 

and prediction of other precipitate compounds in the solar evaporation pond system. 

Chloride concentration was identified to be the major contributor to those brine samples where the major ion 

balance fell out of range. Chloride concentration was adjusted in the model data set to reflect the ion ratio for 

halite using the corresponding sodium concentration for the sample. This change brought the majority of the 

sample results to within the 0.95 to 1.05 range. The remaining samples outside of the 0.95 to 1.05 range were 

brought to an acceptable ion ratio range (0.95 or 1.05) by adjusting the sulfate content.  

The reasons for these adjustments to the anionic constituents are outlined below: 

 Norwest's comparison of the major ion ratios between Hazen laboratory's bulk sample test results 

and the test results (Pepper, 2013) from exploration hole samples indicated that the latter's chloride 

to sodium ratios showed a greater range than the Hazen results, where the former were noted to 

have an acceptable ion balance
6
.  

 Hazen used a more accurate, but significantly more expensive and time consuming, gravimetric 

method for testing the major brine anions (Cl
-
 and SO4

2-
) (Pepper, 2013). Whereas the brine samples 

used in the Mineral Resource model
7
 used ion chromatography (EPA 300.0/SW 9056) testing methods 

for anions that are less expensive and time consuming, but also inherently less accurate.  

 Halite is expected to comprise more than 80% of potential salt precipitated from the brine Mineral 

Resource. Accordingly, chloride concentration trends should be closely aligned with sodium. However, 

this was not observed in many of the brine sample results from the explorations holes due to possible 

precipitation of halite crystals in the sample between testing for cations (e.g., Na
+
) and for anions 

(e.g., Cl
-
). 

 Cation analyses performed using ICP methods are believed to be very accurate, as confirmed by 

statistical analysis and comparison between different laboratories. Therefore, this method provides a 

more reliable basis for the adjustment of related anions. Univariate statistics for the modeled and ion 

balanced cations and anions are listed in Table  14-4.

Prior brine and SOP Resource investigations, culminating in the PFS estimate (CH2M Hill, 2013), used 

laboratory-derived ion concentrations that did not factor a total ion balance in the reported results, ion 

balance results that might be desired for detailed studies of related salt behavior in evaporation pond 

modeling. The variance in total ion balance of the exploration assays was identified in the PFS Report and was 

investigated further during the current study. The variance was further evaluated for the cause and the 

potential impacts to the accuracy of major ion concentrations affecting the SOP Resources and Reserves 

presented in this Technical Report. It has been determined that the driving elemental concentrations, the 

cation salt elements, K
+
, Na

+
, and Mg

+
, have been validated and are deemed of sufficient accuracy for 

estimates of Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates of SOP and related compounds, as well as estimates of 

precipitation of non-commercial compounds involved with the operation of solar evaporation ponds and 

process engineering for a commercial SOP product.  

The exploration brine sample results for K
+
 are on average closely aligned with the Hazen bulk sample test 

results. The Detailed Engineering required in support of the FS has necessitated that the estimated brine 

chemistry derived from the Mineral Resource model have balanced cation and anion concentrations. As such, 

the total K
+
 concentration is not impacted by the ion balance adjustments and, overall, there are no significant 

material impacts on the brine Mineral Resource and potash production potential following these anion 

adjustments. 

14.3 Database Verification 

Prior to modeling, the master database was subjected to the following standard checks for inconsistencies: 

 Drill hole sample depth intervals and survey locations 

 Drill hole collar elevations against LiDAR surface topography data 

 Lakebed boundary mapping versus regional public domain lakebed mapping 

 Anomalous values in moisture content, SG and brine chemistry 

 Comparison between penetrometer results and moisture content 

 Comparison between laboratory assay certificates and electronic records 

All observed inconsistencies and apparent errata were resolved following checks of the base data or after 

consultation with the concerned parties.

14.4 Geological Model 

Brine Mineral Resources were reported from a gridded surface model (GSM) that covers the extent of the 

Sevier Playa boundary. There are two identical geologic models used as the basis for reporting brine Mineral 

Resources: 

 Metric GSM for reporting in metric units (meters). 

 State Plane GSM for reporting in United States customary units (feet). 

The State Plane GSM uses the source Central Utah North American Datum of 1983 State Plane coordinate 

system. The metric grid model uses the UTM Zone 12 WGS84 datum coordinate system. 

14.4.1 Spatial Correlation 

The stratigraphy of the brine aquifer horizons was determined from the correlations of drill hole lithologic 

descriptions, penetrometer results, carbonate content and moisture content measurements and has been 

presented in Section 7.4: Playa Stratigraphy, Figure ‎7-5. The brine aquifer is confined to within the boundary 

of the lakebed surface, and Mineral Resource estimates to within controlled lease boundaries.  

Along the lakebed boundary, there is a clear transition from surface soil to a gypsum-halite duricrust. The 

horizons below the duricrust, encompassing the FCZ, MCZ and SCZ have been correlated, as well as sub-

horizons within these major units. The contact between all three clay aquifers can be distinguished 

lithologically; however, from a hydrologic and brine chemistry perspective, the contacts are interpreted to be 

gradational. 

The FCZ has generally high moisture contents, typically between 45% and 50%, with penetrometer readings 

near or below the minimum detection limit. The underlying MCZ has a slightly lower moisture content, 

between 40% and 45%, with penetrometer readings between 0 to 1.25 st/ft
2 

(1.25 kg/cm
2
). There is a 3.4-foot 

(1.04-meter) stiff clay interval within the MCZ where the penetrometer readings are as high as 3 st/ft
2 

(3 

kg/cm
2
). The lower zone, comprising the SCZ aquifer, has slightly lower moisture content than the MCZ above, 

typically between 35% and 45%, with penetrometer readings between 0.75 to 1.5 st/ft
2
 (0.75 to 1.5 kg/cm

2
). 

The basal contact of the SCZ is identified by the presence of a hard, dry clay where penetrometer readings 

typically exceed 5 st/ft
2
 (5 kg/cm

2
). Further details regarding the above three brine aquifers are described in 

detail in Section ‎7.4: Playa Stratigraphy.  

14.4.2 Brine Aquifer Interpolation 

The thickness and depth from surface of the three major brine aquifers' was interpolated into a 2D GSM from 

drill hole intercepts. The surface topography grid was used as the reference surface from which to stack grid 

estimates of brine aquifer thickness for calculating horizon top and base elevations into the model. The 

Carlson
©

 GSM setup and estimation parameters are outlined in Table ‎14-5. Source LiDAR data was de-

cluttered to 65.6 feet by 65.6 feet (20 meters by 20 meters) grid spacing prior to the Mineral Resource 

estimates for efficient data processing. The surface topography grid data was smoothed after de-cluttering in 

areas of recent surface disturbance, such as along historical canals and dykes in the south of the Playa. The 

smoothing was performed to ensure that the modeled brine aquifers maintain their original geologic locations 

across areas of man-made disturbance.

Cross-sections illustrating the subsurface extent of the three major brine aquifers are illustrated in Figure 

‎14-2. The vertical scale in the cross-sections has been increased to 25 times the horizontal scale to best 

illustrate the spatial variability of the brine aquifer. The cross-sections illustrate the extent of the three 

modeled saturated brine aquifers, videlicet fat clay, marl clay and siliceous clay. The underlying dry clay zone 

has not been modeled, but is illustrated in the cross-sections to extend to a maximum depth of 520 feet 

(158.5) bgs (400 feet elevation [121.9 meters]). This illustrated surface is 20 feet (6.1 meters) below the 

maximum exploration hole depth of 500 feet (152.4 meters) from drill hole SN2-400, which did not penetrate 

any solid basement rock formations. As such, the dry clay zone may extend well beyond the depth limit as 

illustrated in the cross-sections. 

Color contour plots of brine horizon thickness are illustrated in Figure ‎14-3, and brine horizon floor elevations 

are illustrated in Figure ‎14-4. Observation of these plans and cross-sections indicate an overall increase in 

thickness and depth from the margins of the lakebed to the center of the lakebed. However, exploration 

drilling and CPT drilling both indicate a significant thinning of lakebed sediments at the Playa boundary.

14.4.3 Moisture and Brine Grade Interpolation 

The estimation of moisture content and brine grade (cations and anions) into the MineSight® 2D grid model 

was influenced by the results of geostatistical analyses of the source drill hole sample data as well as by 

differences in sampling methods and results between direct-push and sonic holes.  

Frequency distribution plots (histograms) of sample moisture content and brine chemistry were used to 

identify outliers in the sample data. The moisture and brine grade histograms are illustrated in Figure ‎14-5. 

The distribution of the source sample data indicates an overall normal-type distribution, with no materially-

significant outliers, and no top cuts were applied to the sample data used for modeling.  

Two-dimensional (2D) uni-directional semi-variogram charts, from composite brine aquifer intervals in the 

drill hole records, are illustrated in Figure ‎14-6. The best-fit experimental variograms from the charts 

illustrated in Figure ‎14-6 indicates a maximum range to sill of approximately 9,842 feet (3,000 meters) 

beyond which the relationship between sample grade pairs is viewed as random or inferred. 

Figure ‎14-7 outlines the moisture and brine grade estimation methods used for estimating sediment 

moisture content and brine grades into the MineSight® model.  

The brine Mineral Resource classification is influenced by the results of the semi-variogram analysis of the 

brine cation and brine anion sample data. The search ranges outlined in Table ‎14-7 are also used to tag the 

block estimates as Measured (first pass), Indicated (second pass), or Inferred (third pass). All grade and 

moisture content estimates used lithologic matching. To reduce the potential for dilution of upper zone brine 

samples from SCZ brine, the upper zone brine grade estimation has been limited to the samples sourced from 

direct push holes that typically only penetrate the FCZ and MCZ aquifers.

The distribution in estimated gravimetric moisture content composited across each of the three brine 

aquifers is illustrated in Figure ‎14-7. The moisture content in the brine aquifers shows a slight decrease from 

the center of the Playa towards lakebed margins. Moisture content is also highest in the FCZ when compared 

to the underlying MCZ and SCZ.

The concentration of potassium in the brine is the primary ion of interest since its concentration is the 

limiting constituent in the production of SOP potash. The distribution of brine cation and anion estimates for 

the three brine aquifers is illustrated in Figure ‎14-8 through Figure ‎14-12. The brine grade plans illustrate 

increasing concentrations from the Playa boundary towards the center of the Playa, where concentration of 

potassium, for example, exceeds 3,000 mg/L. The lowest concentrations of potassium in all three clay 

aquifers are in the northeast and eastern shoreline, where the concentration of potassium is mostly less than 

2,500 mg/L. In general, brine sampled from the SCZ in the northern half of the lakebed has lower potassium 

concentration (less than 3,000 mg/L) than the overlying MCZ and FCZ brines. Overall, the potassium 

concentrations for brine samples taken from the southern half of the Playa for all three clay aquifers show a 

greater concentration of potassium over a wider area than that observed for brine samples taken from the 

north.

14.4.4 Brine Aquifer Porosity Calculations 

The brine aquifer porosity percentage is used as a measure of volume (or percentage) of the aquifer volume 

that contains brine (the brine volume) in the saturated sediments. Equation 14.2 is used: 

    
             

            
 

               
 
        (14.2) 

Where: 

BV= brine volume (m
3
), also referred to as porosity in saturated brine clays 

AV= aquifer volume (m
3
) reported from geologic model 

MT= in-place gravimetric moisture content (wt%/100) reported from model 

SGS = dry sediment solids SG, a constant set at 2.84
8
 g/cc 

The calculated brine Mineral Resource tonnes, using the above formula is: 

BT = BV × BSG  

Where: 

BT = brine tonnes 

BSG = brine SG reported from the geologic model 

Using the above formula, IGES has compared the reported porosity with direct measurements of porosity in 

18 Shelby tube samples. Average direct measurement of porosity from the 18 samples was 52.9%. The 

average calculated porosity for the same samples using the above formula was 54.6%. This absolute 

difference of 1.7% between the two results is considered sufficient validation of the porosity formula given 

the potential for compression of the sediments during sampling that would result in an underreporting of 

porosity when compared to in-place (undisturbed) porosity.  

14.4.5 Geologic Model Validation 

The block model estimates were validated against the source drill hole sample database by comparing the 

drill hole sample data against the nearest grid estimates. This comparison is best illustrated with the aid of 

swath plots that compare the mean drill hole sample grades with mean grid estimates at regular intervals 

across the model area.  

The west-to-east oriented swath plots are illustrated in Figure ‎14-13, and south-to-north orientated swath 

plots are illustrated in Figure ‎14-14. No overestimation or underestimation trends were observed in any of 

the plots.

 Derived from average of 43 clay sediment samples, prior PFS estimates used 2.88 SG from 25 clay samples.

14.5 Mineral Resource Statement 

Brine Mineral Resource estimates were derived from the GSM of the Playa that was created using CPM's 

current drilling and analytical data. The estimated in-place brine Mineral Resources and related major 

dissolved cations and anions for the FCZ, MCZ, and SCZ brine aquifers are presented in Table ‎14-8 through 

14-11. The effective date of the estimated Mineral Resources is January 11, 2018. 

 A total Measured plus Indicated in-place brine Mineral Resource is estimated to be 6,777 million short tons 

(6,148 million metric tonnes), from which K
+
 concentrations create a Measured plus Indicated in-place 

potassium Resource of 17.09 million short tons (15.51 million metric tonnes). This represents a slightly 

greater in-place Mineral Resource when compared to the PFS, which reported a total Measured plus 

Indicated category of 15.54 million short tons (14.10 million metric tonnes) of in-place K
+
.  

Elements differentiating the current Mineral Resource estimate from the PFS estimate are primarily the 

drilling of 12 strategically placed exploration holes on the Playa during the 2015 drilling campaign, notably 

bringing a higher level of Measured plus Indicated assurance to the SCZ. Other, though less significant, 

impacts on the in-place Mineral Resource estimates between the PFS (CH2M Hill, 2013) and FS include: 

 Changes in modeling setup from 3D block model to GSM model. 

 Modification in porosity calculation formula to account for precipitated salts. 

 Brine SG adjustments to reflect major ion concentration trends.

Past Mineral Resource estimates for the Project have reported in-place Mineral Resource values only since 

the hydrologic data required for estimates of specific yield were still being developed. Best practice 

guidelines adopted by CIM for the reporting of Mineral Resources from lithium brines (Canadian Institute of 

Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, 2012) eventually established the concept of applying estimated specific 

yield values to the in-place brine Mineral Resource quantities, representing what might be potentially 

extractable by gravity drainage. It is important to recognize that the method of applying specific yield to the 

in-place Mineral Resource does not account for the introduction of recharge water contemplated through

the mine development process of the Project, nor does it consider the effects of mass transfer. For this 

reason, the potentially extractable Mineral Resources do not include the additional potassium that becomes 

available through the tonnage produced in the recharge and mass transfer processes that are considered a 

part of the Mineral Reserve.  

The potentially extractable Mineral Resource outlined in Table ‎14-13 and related compounds in Table ‎14-14 

incorporates specific yield values representative of the various lithotypes within the hydrostratigraphic units 

and report Mineral Resource quantities based on the brine tonnages calculated as extractable. Table ‎14-14 

estimates conceptual tonnages of mineral equivalent compounds that could be produced from the 

potentially extractable cations and anions in the total brine Mineral Resource as presented in the preceding 

tables.

Measured plus Indicated potentially extractable equivalent K2SO4 Resource from the Measured plus Indicated 

brine is calculated to be approximately 10.5 million short tons (9.538 million metric tonnes), based on the 

potentially extractable K
+
 Resource. An Inferred potentially extractable K

+
 Resource is estimated at 273,000 

short tons (248,000 metric tonnes); with a K2SO4 equivalent of 609,000 short tons (553,000 metric tonnes). 

Mineral equivalent compounds are calculated based on atomic weights of the constituent elements and their 

molecular ratios. Mineral Resource plans illustrating the distribution of brine Mineral Resources by levels of 

assurance for the three brine aquifers are illustrated in Figure ‎14-15.  

The accuracy of Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity of 

available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Given the data available at the 

time this Technical Report was prepared, the estimates presented herein are considered reasonable. 

However, they should be accepted with the understanding that additional data and analysis available

no guarantee that all or any part of the estimated Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves will be recoverable.  

The ability to produce the estimated quantity of Mineral Reserves derived from the Mineral Resources above 

is dependent upon the successful execution of the Cooperative Development Agreement between Peak 

Minerals and LUMA. While there has been no decision by the agencies formally creating a Unit Agreement, it 

is likely to be successfully adopted given that BLM was the originator of the unitized approach to the liquid 

mineral commodity and it is supported by BLM, SITLA, Emerald Peak, CPM, and LUMA. Peak has worked for 

numerous years on the permitting process for the Project and has progressed to the point of triggering the 

required Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Project. Additional discussion of project risks is 

included in Section ‎15.7: Summary and Conclusions.

ITEM 15: MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

15.1 Overview 

The FS has demonstrated that the Project is economically viable and is presented in ‎Item 22: Economic 

Analysis. As a result of the favorable economic results presented in the FS, in-place Measured plus Indicated 

Mineral Resources described in ‎Item 14: Mineral Resource Estimates have been upgraded to Proven and 

Probable Mineral Reserves, respectively, and will be discussed in this section of the Report. A Mineral 

Reserve estimate has been developed for the Project by CPM's groundwater modeling consultant team 

(Norwest and CH2M) who have co-developed an integrated PGFM and PSTM of the Sevier Playa. This section 

describes the construction and application of these numerical models in developing the mine plan and 

Mineral Reserve estimate. Norwest was responsible for developing the mine plan and directed the overall 

mine planning approach with CH2M supporting Norwest in this effort. Examples of support from CH2M 

included providing initial estimates of aquifer hydraulic and mass-transfer parameter values from field tests 

conducted by CH2M, creating pre- and post-processing tools to help manage the simulations, helping 

troubleshoot problematic simulations, and participating in discussions to help complete the model 

development and calibration process. In addition, CH2M was responsible for development and 

implementation of the solute transport aspects of the integrated model including the conceptualization 

approach to establish the basis for the modeled solute transport parameters and processes.  

The integrated numerical groundwater model simulates more complex subsurface processes than are 

included in typical numerical groundwater models. This is because the economic viability of the anticipated 

mining Project will be constrained by specific and complex subsurface hydraulic and transport processes such 

as density- and viscosity-dependent flow, and mass-transfer of target ions between mobile- and immobile 

porosity zones. Considerable effort was spent to account for these and other important subsurface processes 

that will influence the extractability of high-grade brine from the Playa. The model was developed using the 

MODFLOW-SURFACT (MFSF), Version 4 code (Hydrogeologic Inc., 2011) in conjunction with Groundwater 

Vistas Version 6, which served as the primary pre- and post-processing graphical user interface. MFSF is a 

physically-based, spatially-distributed numerical modeling code that simulates 3D density-dependent 

groundwater flow and solute transport. This Technical Report section presents a statement of Mineral 

Reserves for the Project and describes how the Mineral Reserve estimates were determined using the model 

results. Norwest's Manager, Water Resources, Richard Reinke, P.Geo., is the QP responsible for the Mineral 

Reserve estimate. 

15.1.1 Background 

Brine is extracted from Playa sediments during the mining phase and concentrated in ponds via solar 

evaporation. Extraction occurs via a trench network that targets the marl clay, with a trench depth of 20 feet 

(6.1 meters) and a vertical extraction well network that targets a depth interval between 20 feet (6.1 meters) 

bgs and 100 feet (30.5 meters) bgs. Construction and operation of the trench network is divided into 21 sub-

areas across the Playa. Extracted brine is conveyed by a system of trenches and canals to a series of pre-

concentration ponds. These ponds concentrate the minerals in solution and begin the precipitation of 

unwanted salt compounds. Downstream from the pre-concentration ponds, the potassium-rich concentrated 

brine is precipitated in production ponds, harvested and processed in a crystallization plant to produce 

saleable SOP and associated products.

Prior to developing the FS and NI 43-101 reports, several evaluations had to be completed including, but not 

limited to, recharge water availability, pond sizing and brine extractability from the Playa. These evaluations 

included the development and use of diverse types of computer models to develop forecasts to be included 

in the FS and NI 43-101 Reports. The computer models and simulations described in this section are related 

to the evaluation of brine extractability from the Playa. 

15.1.2 Modeling Objectives 

The modeling objectives associated with the evaluation of brine extractability from the Playa were developed 

collaboratively among Norwest and CH2M, and are as follows: 

 Integrate hydrogeologic information collected over several years during the various field programs 

into numerical groundwater flow and solute transport models to improve the understanding of the 

groundwater flow and transport components of the conceptual model of the Playa aquifer system. 

 Provide a numerical framework to support developing the brine-extraction components of a 30-year 

mine plan by forecasting the configuration of trenches and extraction wells, along with the 

sequencing of this infrastructure that may be needed to achieve SOP-production targets over a 30-

year mine life. 

 Help inform, along with other site data and professional judgment, estimates of Mineral Reserve. 

 Aid in identifying additional data that, if collected, would help reduce uncertainty in model forecasts. 

15.2 Hydrogeologic Model 

15.2.1 Model Assumptions and Limitations 

The spatial scale and complex physical and chemical environment at the Playa present some specific 

challenges and limitations. Although a significant amount of field data has been collected over the past 

several years to help develop a Conceptual Basin Model (CBM), the Playa covers a geographic area of 

approximately 200 mi
2 

(518 km
2
). The vast spatial scale of the Playa necessitates interpolation of field data 

over distances of hundreds to thousands of feet. Thus, various degrees of uncertainty exist in the distribution 

of K
+
 Resource and the hydraulic and chemical transport properties across the Playa.  

The primary function of PGFM and PSTM is to help develop a 30-year mine plan that, if implemented, would 

have the best chance of achieving the brine flow and grade targets necessary to support production. 

However, predictive simulations extending three decades into the future inherently include significant 

predictive uncertainty. Thus, future mining performance could be different than what has been forecast with 

PGFM and PSTM. Furthermore, PGFM is designed to simulate average hydrologic conditions. As such, the 

modeled hydrology does not change through time. This means that seasonal hydrologic influences on 

Mineral Resource extractability have not been evaluated. 

An additional source of uncertainty is introduced because PGFM and PSTM do not simulate surface water 

processes. PGFM and PSTM are numerical groundwater models. As such, they do not address issues of 

surface water routing and conveyance.  

Given these sources of uncertainty, PGFM and PSTM should be viewed as insight tools rather than definitive 

predictors of future flow and grade during a 30-year mine operation. PGFM and PSTM output should be

Novopro Projects Inc. 

scrutinized and used in conjunction with observational site data and professional judgment. These models 

should be periodically updated with new data as they become available to improve their utility. 

15.2.1.1 Numerical Assumptions 

PGFM and PSTM, and similar numerical groundwater models, are based on the assumptions that Darcy's Law 

is valid (i.e., laminar subsurface flow conditions prevail) and that the aquifer's "behavior" at practical spatial 

scales (i.e., tens to hundreds of meters in this case) is equivalent to that of a porous medium for both flow 

and transport. All model layers are treated as vertically-integrated layers to facilitate accurate simulations of 

3D groundwater flow and K
+
 transport conditions. PGFM and PSTM accommodate the standard suite of 

groundwater flow and solute transport model boundary conditions. 

More specifically, PGFM and PSTM conceptualize the Playa aquifer as a variable-density and variable-viscosity 

subsurface flow regime that is simulated using the concept of equivalent fresh water heads to determine the 

flow field. PGFM and PSTM also include density- and viscosity-coupling of hydraulic conductivity. With this 

approach, all initial-head conditions, boundary-head conditions and hydraulic conductivity values must be 

input into the models in fresh water terms. Groundwater elevations (i.e., heads) that are computed from 

groundwater-level measurements at the Playa must initially be adjusted to account for the fact that the fluid 

is a brine (i.e., a dense fluid), rather than fresh water (Hydrogeologic Inc., 2011; Guo & Langevin, 2002). 

Likewise, hydraulic conductivity values that have been estimated using field measurements that are 

indicative of brine conditions (i.e., no fresh recharge water has been introduced in the subsurface) must also 

be adjusted so that equivalent fresh water hydraulic conductivities are input to the models (HGL, 2011). With 

all relevant input parameters converted into equivalent fresh water terms, the model can automatically 

adjust the fluid density and viscosity as the K
+
 concentration changes during the simulation using 

mathematical equations coded into the software. 

PGFM and PSTM implement the dual-domain solute transport formulation. With this type of formulation, 

both the mobile and immobile porosity and the transfer of K
+
 mass between these porosity domains can be 

simulated. The rate of mass transfer between these porosity domains is computed each time as the quotient 

of the difference in K
+
 concentration between the mobile and immobile porosity domains and a first-order 

rate constant that constrains the kinetics of mass transfer. Thus, the inherent assumption with the dual-

domain transport formulation in model code is that the mass-transfer process follows first-order kinetics. 

15.2.1.2 Limitations 

Mathematical models of groundwater systems can only approximate physical and chemical processes, 

despite their high degree of precision. A major cause of the lack of accuracy in these types of models is the 

discrepancy between the scale and coverage of measurements needed to understand subsurface conditions, 

and the scale of measurement generally made under the constraints of limited time and budget (Rojstaczer, 

1994). Thus, numerical groundwater models like PGFM and PSTM should be considered insight tools and 

qualitative predictors of future conditions. Therefore, important planning decisions that are informed by 

output from PGFM and PSTM should be made with an understanding of the uncertainty in and sensitivity to 

model input parameters and need to consider other site data, professional judgment, and inclusion of safety 

factors. No warranties of the forecasts of future conditions, explicit or implied, are provided.

15.3 Conceptual Model Overview 

15.3.1 Hydrostratigraphic Units 

To facilitate mine planning, the upper approximately 100 feet (30.5 meters) of basin-fill sediments has been 

classified into three distinct hydrostratigraphic units (HSUs) referred to as the fat clay, marl clay and siliceous 

clay. The characteristics of these units have been previously described in detail in ‎Item 7: Geological Setting 

and Mineralization and ‎Item 14: Mineral Resource Estimates of this Technical Report. The fat clay is a 

predominantly plastic clay with low hydraulic conductivity. The marl clay is a higher-permeability clay zone 

located beneath the fat clay with a granular texture that arises from what is observed to be soft gypsum 

granules. The siliceous clay is a siliceous-rich stiff clay of generally low permeability; however, it contains four 

coarse grained sand and gravel beds. The bulk permeability of the siliceous clay is generally lower than that 

of the marl clay with most of the permeability due to the thin sand and gravel units. 

15.3.2 Groundwater Flow 

Groundwater elevation data allow for characterization of the baseline groundwater flow patterns, in the 

Sevier Playa. The marl and siliceous clay HSUs are confined by the 12-foot (3.7-meter) thick fat clay, with 

potentiometric heads near or above the ground surface across the Playa. 

Figure ‎15-1 is a map of the groundwater potentiometric (i.e., head) surface constructed from groundwater 

levels measured in the summer of 2015 from wells completed in surrounding alluvial/colluvial aquifers and in 

the upper 100 feet (30.5 meters) of the Playa aquifer. The contours shown in Figure ‎15-1 represent 

equivalent fresh water heads. Thus, the heads have been corrected for variations in fluid density. The 

purpose for showing the head surfaces of the Playa and surrounding alluvial/colluvial aquifers on one figure is 

to help reveal groundwater flow characteristics between these aquifers. The resultant pattern in the 

horizontal hydraulic gradient is consistent with the Playa groundwater system that generally gains 

groundwater flow from mountain-front recharge in the east and outflows groundwater to the adjacent 

alluvial/colluvial aquifer in the west. 

15.3.3 Climate 

Because the basin is terminal, hydrology and hydrogeology are sensitive to climate. During years in which 

precipitation is near normal, the pan evaporation rate of approximately 34.31 in/yr (872.35 mm/yr)
9 

as 

measured during the field testwork described in Section ‎13.3.1: Field Test Programs, greatly exceeds the 

precipitation. The Playa averages 8.03 inches (204 millimeters) of annual precipitation(Gwynn, 2006). 

Infiltration of surface water into Playa sediments is therefore highly dependent on the intensity, duration, 

and timing of precipitation.  

15.3.4 Groundwater Balance Components and Boundary Conditions 

This subsection summarizes the components of the Playa groundwater balance and the representation as 

model boundary conditions. Details of the implementation of these boundary conditions in the model are 

available from CPM.

Novopro Projects Inc. 

15.3.4.1 Groundwater Inflow Components 

Groundwater inflow components of the Playa include groundwater recharge from precipitation and 

subsurface inflow from adjacent areas. Given that the average annual evaporation rate greatly exceeds the 

average annual precipitation rate, and the low permeability of the fat clay, groundwater recharge resulting 

from surface infiltration on the Playa is likely small under average conditions. Areal recharge is represented in 

the model using the MFSF recharge package. 

Subsurface inflow represents the combined processes of inflow from the surrounding alluvial/colluvial 

aquifer system and mountain-block recharge. In the northeast, the Sevier River is a source of subsurface 

inflow to the Playa aquifer through connection of alluvial sediments in the river channel with the 

alluvial/colluvial aquifer in this area. Subsurface inflow from outside the model domain is represented using 

the MFSF general head boundary (GHB) package. 

15.3.4.2 Groundwater Outflow Components 

Groundwater outflow components of the Playa include groundwater evapotranspiration (mostly 

evaporation) from the fat clay and subsurface outflow to adjacent areas. Although the Sevier Playa 

experiences high potential evaporation rates, the 12 feet (3.7 meters) of fat clay that caps the brine aquifer 

limits evaporation rates. However, the high total dissolved solids concentration measured in Playa 

groundwater provides evidence that salts have been evapoconcentrated. Evapotranspiration is represented 

in the model using the MFSF evapotranspiration (ET) package. 

Subsurface outflow from the Playa aquifer is indicated by the potentiometric head contours shown in Figure 

‎15-1. Outflow from the Playa aquifer occurs along the western boundary of the Playa. Subsurface outflow 

from outside the model domain is represented using the MFSF GHB package.

15.3.5 Subsurface Constituents of Interest 

SOP is the primary mineral compound of interest associated with this Project. Additional mineral compounds 

such as bitterns, including magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4); halite (NaCl); and 

salt cake (Na2SO4) occur as precipitates in the solar evaporation process and have some use and potential 

marketability. Ancillary minerals, such as lithium (Li) and bromine (Br), are also present in the Playa brine and 

are being evaluated for commercial viability.  

Ion balance from laboratory analysis of brine samples indicates that potassium is the limiting brine 

constituent for SOP production from the Playa. Therefore, PGFM and PSTM simulate the flow and transport 

of K
+
 and SOP-production estimates outside of these numerical models assumed that the required sulfate is 

available in the produced brine. 

15.3.6 Model Domain 

The following subsections describe the areal and vertical characteristics of the PGFM and PSTM model 

domain.  

15.3.6.1 Areal Characteristics of Model Grid 

The model grid was aligned north-south and east-west and georeferenced to the WGS84 horizontal datum of 

the UTM, Zone 12 North coordinate system, in units of meters. Model cells representing areas outside the 

Playa boundary were set as inactive. The model domain was discretized into 1,290 rows and 659 columns 

resulting in 850,110 cells per model layer. Row and column spacing ranged from 82 feet (25 meters) to 

328 feet (100 meters) with cell areas ranging from 0.15 acres (625 m
2
) to 12.5 acres (10,000 m

2
). An initial 

grid spacing of 328 feet (100 meters) used the same grid as the Mineral Resource model, and the grid spacing 

was then refined to 82 feet (25 meters), over the area of the Playa to be mined with the cell spacing 

increasing toward the outlying areas to reduce the overall number of model cells and computational time. 

15.3.6.2 Vertical Characteristics of Model Grid 

PGFM and PSTM have six layers representing the three HSUs described in Section ‎15.3.1: Hydrostratigraphic 

Units (i.e., fat clay, marl clay, and siliceous clay). Elevations of these layers are referenced to North American 

Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88), Geoid 12a. The base of the siliceous clay unit is marked by the presence of 

a dull red, dry, hard clay. This unit is assumed to be impermeable and is represented by a no flow boundary 

at the base of Layer 6. 

15.3.7 Subsurface Hydraulic Parameters 

15.3.7.1 Hydraulic Conductivity 

Model input values of hydraulic conductivity of the fat clay, marl clay, and siliceous clay HSUs are based on 

results from various aquifer tests at the Playa and on the distribution of clay and gravel within these units. 

Aquifer pumping tests conducted on 46 marl clay wells, 6 siliceous clay wells, 15 wells screened over both the 

marl clay and siliceous clay, and 7 marl clay trench tests are described in the Sevier Lake Aquifer Testing 

Report (CH2M Hill, 2012). Based on PFS recommendations, an additional 13 marl clay/siliceous clay nested 

well pairs and 3 marl clay wells paired with existing siliceous clay wells were installed. Pumping tests of

Novopro Projects Inc. 

varying durations from 1 hour to 54 hours conducted on these well pairs are summarized in Section ‎9.7: 

Groundwater Hydrology Program. 

The fat clay horizontal hydraulic conductivity (Kh) was set to 5.9x10
-4

 ft/d (1.8×10
-4

 m/d). The vertical 

hydraulic conductivity (Kv) in the fat clay is assigned as one-tenth of the Kh; thus, a Kh:Kv ratio of 10:1 was 

implemented in the layers representing the fat clay based on model calibration to potentiometric head 

targets. This relatively low Kh:Kv ratio is consistent with observations of surface breakthrough of injected 

water at relatively low injection pressures during WtW and WtT testing conducted during the 2015-2016 field 

season.  

Marl clay Kh values range from 1.2 ft/d (0.36 m/d) to 120 ft/d (36.7 m/d). Distribution of marl clay Kh is shown 

on Figure ‎15-2. The Kh:Kv ratio in the marl clay is 1.5:1. Distribution of marl clay Kv is shown on Figure ‎15-3. 

Kh values for the siliceous clay HSU range from 0.08 ft/d (0.025 m/d) to 25.6 ft/d (7.8 m/d), and the Kh:Kv ratio 

in the siliceous clay HSU ranges from 100:1 in areas with less gravel content to 230,000:1 in areas with higher 

gravel content. The distribution of Kh of the siliceous clay is shown in Figure ‎15-3. 

15.3.7.2 Specified Yield 

Storativity and specific yield were interpreted from the various field and lab test results conducted on the 

Sevier Playa and from literature values where field or lab results were not available. The specific yield for the 

fat clay and the siliceous clay was set to 0.06. This value is derived from a pit infiltration test in the fat clay 

referenced in the PFS (Whetstone Associates, 2013). Specific yield for the marl clay was based on several core 

samples across the Playa that were analyzed for RBRC, conducted at the DB Stephens lab in Albuquerque, 

New Mexico. RBRC results for the marl clay were spatially interpreted across the Playa in the Mineral 

Resource model and imported into PGFM and PSTM. Marl clay specific yield ranges from 0.01 to 0.07.  

15.3.7.3 Storativity 

A specific storage (Ss) value of 3.28x10
-4 

per foot (1×10
-4

 per meter) was assumed for all layers, which results 

in a storativity (Ss × thickness) of 2.4×10
-4

 to 5.1×10
-4

 for the fat clay, 7.4×10
-5

 to 7.5×10
-4

 for the marl clay, 

and 2.1×10
-4

 to 2.7×10
-3

 for the siliceous clay. The assumed Ss value was based on results of various aquifer 

tests that included drawdown measurements in monitoring wells conducted on the Playa including the WtT 

test conducted in the marl clay and several pumping tests at wells completed in the siliceous clay.  

15.3.7.4 Initial Groundwater Levels 

Initial equivalent fresh water heads assumed in PGFM simulations were based on the potentiometric surface 

for the Playa derived from 2015 groundwater level measurements adjusted to reflect brine density (Figure 

‎15-1). 

15.3.8 Subsurface Transport Parameters 

This subsection describes the transport processes that are active in PSTM, which is mathematically linked 

with PGFM. These models have been developed for this Project to simulate the transport processes of 

advection, diffusion, mechanical dispersion and dual-domain mass transfer. Detailed descriptions of dual-

domain mass transfer and initial potassium concentration are included in this subsection. Reports with 

detailed descriptions of other transport parameters are available from CPM.

15.3.8.1 Dual-domain Mass Transfer Coefficient 

The dual-domain mass transfer process is the only transport process in PSTM that moves K
+
 mass from the 

immobile porosity to the mobile porosity and vice versa. The transfer of K
+
 mass between the immobile-

porosity and mobile-porosity zones occurs as a diffusive process that is controlled by the K
+
 concentration 

difference between these porosity zones and a first-order rate coefficient that constrains the K
+
 mass flux 

between these porosity zones in each model cell at each time step. This first-order rate coefficient is herein 

referred to as the dual-domain Mass Transfer Coefficient (MTC).  

Implementing the dual-domain mass transfer process in a groundwater model is an acknowledgment that the 

mobility of K
+
 mass at the grid-block scale (i.e., 82 feet × 82 feet [25 meters x 25 meters]) is influenced by 

finer-scale transport processes within the zone represented by the grid block. Without implementing the 

dual-domain mass-transfer formulation, one can only assign a single effective porosity for each model grid 

block; thus, the remaining porosity not included in the effective porosity (i.e., the immobile porosity) and the 

K
+
 mass residing therein is ignored. Ignoring this immobile portion of the porosity would significantly 

underestimate the total K
+
 mass present in the brine aquifer and would underestimate extractable Mineral 

Resource. 

The rate of mass transfer between mobile and immobile porosity domains is space-and time-dependent. As 

such, it is a difficult parameter to account for when conducting predictive simulations over spatial and 

temporal scales that are different than spatial and temporal scales at which MTC estimates are made using 

field-testing data. Moreover, the PSTM forecasts tend to be sensitive to the MTC; thus, it is a transport 

parameter that has a relatively high uncertainty and high importance. In an effort to reduce uncertainty, the 

modeling team used multiple lines of analysis to compute MTCs for use in PSTM. These multiple lines of 

analysis include column testing on cores collected from the marl clay, WtT testing in the marl clay, conceptual 

analysis based on the geometry of diffusion, and professional judgment. The following subsections describe 

how the MTC was computed for each HSU. 

15.3.8.1.1 Fat Clay 

Because the extractability of K
+
 brine from the fat clay is expected to be low (because of low permeability) 

and because of constraints of budget and time, there have not been any field tests aimed at evaluating mass-

transfer characteristics in the fat clay. Thus, the modeling team took more of a conceptual approach that 

considered the geometry of diffusion. The approach undertaken correlates the MTC with an effective 

diffusion rate coefficient. This involved converting the K
+
 open-water diffusion coefficient (D) into a first-

order rate coefficient that represents the MTC. To do this, Equation 15.1 (Crank, 1975; Haggerty, McKenna, & 

Meigs, 2000) is applied: 

          (15.1) 

Where a = the diffusion length through the clay. A  (i.e., tortuosity) value of 0.10 (de Marsily, 1986) was 

assumed because of the insignificant sand content, and the cell-by-cell thickness of the fat clay was used for 

the a term. The D (i.e., open-water K
+
 diffusion coefficient) value for K

+
 is 1.19x10

-3
 ft

2
/d (1.28×10

-5
 cm²/s) (Li 

and Gregory, 1974). This resulted in MTCs that ranged from 1.2×10
-6

 to 6.2×10
-6

 per day (d
-1

), in the fat clay. 

The "3" in Equation 15.1 is a factor that accounts for the geometry of diffusion, which in this case is a finite 

clay layer; geometry factors of 8 and 15 could be used in cases of cylindrical and spherical geometries (Crank,

1975; Haggerty, McKenna, & Meigs, 2000). This range of MTCs indicates that the mass-transfer process in the 

fat clay would not be rapid. 

15.3.8.1.2 Marl Clay 

Mass-transfer characteristics of the marl clay were evaluated during WtT testing in 2015. The WtT test 

consisted of injecting fresh water into five injection wells screened in the marl clay while extracting brine 

from a trench cut into the upper marl clay. Five observation wells screened in the marl clay were located 

between the injection wells and extraction trench to facilitate monitoring the fresh water breakthrough 

during the test and providing data with which to calibrate the MTC in the marl clay. In addition to the WtT 

test, column tests were conducted on four marl clay cores. Deionized water was introduced into the top of 

each brine-saturated core to flush the brine and specific conductance of the effluent was recorded through 

time in a laboratory to monitor the fresh water breakthrough. One-dimensional (1D) numerical groundwater 

flow and solute transport models were used to simulate each column test using the breakthrough data as 

calibration targets to estimate a MTC. The fresh water breakthrough data obtained from the WtT and column 

tests were also analyzed using two different empirical functions that were fit to the late-time data. Table 

‎15-1 summarizes the MTCs using these multiple lines of analysis.

As shown in Table ‎15-1, most of the MTC values were on the order of 10

, with one of the values as high 

as 2 d
-1

, which indicates mass transfer that occurred at the temporal and spatial scales of the corresponding 

tests was rapid. With this information and the knowledge that mass-transfer slows down with increasing 

temporal and spatial scales (Haggerty, Harvey, Freiherr von Schwerin, & Meigs, 2004; Haggerty, 2017), the 

modeling team rounded down the MTC to 10
-3

 d
-1

 for the model cells representing marl clay in PSTM. This 

was done because the main purpose of PGFM and PSTM is to forecast mining performance over thousands of 

hectares on the Playa during a three-decade period (i.e., much larger spatial and temporal scales than those 

associated with the column and WtT tests). Thus, a constant MTC value of 10
-3

 d
-1

 was assigned to model cells 

representing the marl clay in PSTM. 

15.3.8.1.3 Siliceous Clay 

Two single well push-pull injection pump back tests were conducted to evaluate mass-transfer characteristics 

in the siliceous clay. Fresh water was injected into the SCZ and allowed to remain in contact with SCZ brine

over a set residence time. The injected water was then pumped back from the injection wells. These push 

pull tests were of relatively short duration (21 days and 87 days residence time). Stable isotope data collected 

during the pump back for the 87-day test showed that the SCZ brine was assimilating the injected fresh 

water. Stable isotope data collected during the pump back for the 21-day was inconclusive. The 87-day test 

was analyzed in MFSF by the modeling team; however, this analysis resulted in MTC values indicative of the 

short temporal and spatial scale of the test. Thus, the modeling team implemented a conceptual analysis to 

compute MTCs like the approach used for the fat clay. The added complication that needed to be addressed 

was the more complex geometry of diffusion within the siliceous clay. Specifically, the modeling team wanted 

the MTC to account for the presence and absence of sand layers within the siliceous clay. 

The two parameters in Equation 15.1 that are affected by the presence of sand layers within the siliceous 

clay are the  (i.e., tortuosity) and a (i.e., representative diffusion length through the clay layers) terms. 

Node-by-node sand- and clay-thickness values for the siliceous clay were imported from the Mineral 

Resource model to facilitate two calculations. First the value was linearly scaled between 0.1 (clay) and 0.7 

(sand) (de Marsily, 1986), based on the percentage of sand present in the siliceous clay at each 

hydrostratigraphic-model node. Next, node-by-node average clay thicknesses in the siliceous clay were 

computed and then halved because diffusion from a clay layer within the siliceous clay would occur in the 

upper and lower halves of the clay toward the respective sand layer, from which extraction of brines would 

occur. Equation 15.1 was then used with the node-by-node and average a values to compute cell-by-cell 

MTCs for the siliceous clay in PSTM.  

As indicated with Equation 15.1, the larger the  value and the smaller the a value, the larger the MTC, which 

would indicate more rapid mass transfer of K
+
 between the immobile and mobile porosity, where there are 

layers of sand between layers of clay. Having alternating and thinner layers of sands and clays in the siliceous 

clay, at a given geographic location, would result in shorter diffusion lengths and more efficient mass transfer 

of K
+
. Conversely, as the presence of sand layers diminishes, and as the clay diffusion lengths increase, the 

mass transfer of K
+
 would become less efficient. Application of Equation 15.1 resulted in MTCs that range 

from 7.1×10
-6

 to 5.0×10
-2

 d
-1

. This range of MTCs spans nearly four orders of magnitude and gives an 

indication of the heterogeneous nature of sands within the siliceous clay. 

15.3.8.2 Initial Potassium Concentration 

Initial potassium concentrations for the fat clay, marl clay, and siliceous clay were imported from the Mineral 

Resource model. Concentrations in the mobile and immobile porosity domains were set equal based on the 

system having limited groundwater movement and likely equilibrium between the mobile and immobile 

domains. The initial potassium concentration for the marl clay and siliceous lay are shown in Figure ‎15-4. 

Table ‎15-2 summarizes the ranges of subsurface transport parameter values that are relevant to PSTM.

15.4 Model Calibration 

Model calibration is a process of tuning a numerical model to simulate selected conditions observed in the 

field (as described with measured data) within a reasonable degree of accuracy. PGFM was calibrated in 

accordance with the Standard Guide for Calibrating a Ground-Water Flow Model Application (American 

Society for Testing and Material, 1996).  

15.4.1 Calibration Targets 

Calibration targets are defined as the selected field-measured values that quantify hydrologic conditions of 

interest with consideration of data quality and reliability. Quantitative calibration targets were selected to 

evaluate progress during calibration of the PGFM. 

Because many of the target wells on the Playa were installed during the last half of 2015, groundwater 

elevations (i.e., head) measured during late 2015 to early 2016 served as quantitative calibration targets. 

Calibration targets were selected in this manner so that head targets would reflect groundwater conditions 

over the same timeframe. There are a number of areas on the Playa with multiple wells having similar 

completions that were used for aquifer characterization and testing. In these cases, one representative target 

was chosen for the marl clay and another for the siliceous clay to avoid the model calibration being 

dominated by clustered wells. In some other areas, wells were screened across both the marl clay and 

siliceous clay without other wells nearby. In these instances, the model targets were evaluated against the 

average of the model predicted heads in the marl clay and siliceous clay at these locations. 

Figure ‎15-5 depicts the quantitative calibration target locations for PGFM, which includes a total of 31 target 

head locations. 

15.4.2 Calibration Process 

The model sensitivity to various hydraulic parameters and boundary conditions was manually evaluated. The 

model was found to be most sensitive to recharge, evapotranspiration, and the vertical conductivity of the fat 

clay. The pre-mining model calibration was found to be relatively insensitive to horizontal hydraulic 

conductivity due to the very low hydraulic gradients measured across the Playa.  

Based on the manual testing of the model sensitivity, automated methods for parameter estimation were 

used to evaluate the evapotranspiration parameters and GHB conductance. The primary stresses on the pre-

mining long-term transient model are precipitation, horizontal inflow from and outflow to surrounding 

colluvial sediments, inflow from colluvial sediments associated with the Sevier River, and evaporation of 

shallow groundwater. Model sensitivity to these stresses were examined manually. Based on the conceptual 

model, both horizontal inflow from GHBs and shallow groundwater evaporation in the ET package were 

estimated using automated parameter estimation software, Model-Independent Parameter Estimation 

and Uncertainty Analysis PEST (2017).

15.4.3 Calibration Results and Discussion 

The residuals (modeled minus measured heads) from the final model calibration are listed in Table ‎15-3 and 

shown in Figure ‎15-6. The model was calibrated to pre-mining groundwater levels measured in 2015 with 

residuals ranging from 3.5 feet (1.1 meters) to -1.9 feet (-58 centimeters). The average residual was 0.4 feet 

(12 centimeters) with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.4 feet (43 centimeters). A common metric for 

evaluating a model's calibration is the normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE) where the RMSE is 

divided by the range in measured heads. The range in measured heads is 9 feet (2.7 meters); thus, the nRMSE 

is approximately 0.17. This value is reasonable given the small range of measured values across the Playa. 

Figure ‎15-6 shows the calibration residuals at each calibration target location. A scatterplot of modeled 

versus measured heads is shown in Figure ‎15-7.

Average daily flows from the simulation are shown in Table ‎15-4. This shows average daily flows in and out of 

storage of less than 0.1 gpm (0.5 m³/d). The modeled groundwater balance is dominated by areal

15.5 Predictive Simulations 

This section describes the application of the integrated numerical model to fulfill the modeling objectives. 

PGFM and PSTM were developed and calibrated with consideration of the availability and reliability of input 

data. These models collectively represent an integrated numerical groundwater flow and solute transport 

model, and were constructed and calibrated to simulate transient groundwater flow, along with the 

transport of K
+
 through the transient groundwater flow field. PGFM solves the governing groundwater flow 

equations. PSTM is mathematically linked with PGFM and solves the governing solute transport equations. K
+
 

has been selected as the modeled solute, rather than sulfate, because of the abundance of sulfate in the 

target brine. In other words, the native K
+ 

dissolved in the brine would be the limiting constituent from an 

SOP mine planning perspective. 

Transport simulations include the processes of advection, mechanical dispersion, diffusion, and dual-domain 

mass transfer within a dynamically coupled flow and transport scheme that accounts for fluid density and 

fluid viscosity influences. Such influences include transient buoyancy effects between fresh recharge water 

and in-situ brine, as well as transient changes to the in-situ hydraulic conductivity of the brine aquifer that 

would result from transient changes in in-situ brine density and viscosity during future mining operations. 

15.5.1 Predictive Simulations Assumptions and Limitations 

The development and application of PGFM and PSTM occurred with the following assumptions and 

limitations: 

 Modeling the Playa subsurface as a porous medium is valid. 

 K
+
 was simulated as a conservative, nonreactive constituent. Cation exchange, with the porous 

medium, is not simulated. 

 Pre-mining K
+
 concentrations, in the mobile and immobile porosity domains, are in equilibrium, 

because the brine aquifer has largely been in a natural state over geologic time. 

 Implementing the concept of equivalent fresh water heads is valid for the intended purpose of PGFM 

and PSTM. 

 The modeling team developed PGFM and PSTM to simulate average hydrologic conditions. Thus, the 

modeled hydrology does not change through time; seasonal hydrology and climate conditions are 

not simulated. 

 Trenches are assumed to remain stable during mining operations. Thus, the assigned trench 

geometries remain constant during the mine planning simulations.  

 Extraction wells are assumed to be highly efficient and equipped with electric submersible pumps, 

with a pumping level set at 3.3 feet (1 meter) above the base of the siliceous clay. 

 The assigned mass-transfer coefficient values remain constant throughout the simulation period. 

Thus, only the K
+
 concentration gradient between the mobile and immobile porosity domains results 

in transient rates of K
+
 mass transfer during the simulation period. 

 The modeling team conducted PGFM and PSTM simulations with the assumption that there would 

be no constraint on recharge-water availability. Thus, the mine plan simulations assume that 

recharge water would be available where and when it is needed in the quantities required to support 

brine extraction rates.

February 21, 2018  Page 181 

 

Novopro Projects Inc. 

 Mine plan simulations do not include a start-up period to fill pre-concentration ponds. Thus, 

simulations assume that brine extraction flow and grade targets would need to be met immediately 

upon start up. In reality, there would likely be a start-up period during which brine extraction flows 

to the pre-concentration ponds would be limited by available trenches during initial construction. 

 Mine plan simulations assume the rate of areal groundwater recharge from precipitation during the 

mine life would be consistent with the rate assigned for current conditions, in the calibrated version 

of the model. In reality, although amounting to approximately 1% of the flow targets, precipitation 

falling directly into recharge trenches would be a source of water, and precipitation falling directly 

into extraction trenches and canals would have a slight dilution effect on the extracted brine. 

 Initially, recharge trenches would function as extraction trenches to locally depressurize the brine 

aquifer and facilitate subsequent gravity-recharge operations.  

 PGFM and PSTM do not simulate surface water processes because they are numerical groundwater 

models. As such, they do not address issues of surface-water routing and conveyance.  

Mathematical models like PGFM and PSTM can only approximate physical and chemical processes, despite 

their high degree of precision. A major cause of uncertainty in these types of models is the discrepancy 

between the coverage of measurements needed to understand subsurface conditions and the coverage of 

measurements generally made under the constraints of limited time and budget (Rojstaczer, 1994). The 

spatial scale and complex physical and chemical environment at the Playa present some specific challenges 

and limitations. Although a significant amount of field data has been collected over the past several years to 

help develop a conceptual basin model, the Playa covers a geographic area of approximately 200 mi
2 

(518 

km
2
). The vast spatial scale of the Playa necessitates interpolation of field data over distances of hundreds to 

thousands of meters. Thus, various degrees of uncertainty exist in the distribution of hydraulic and transport 

properties across the Playa. These uncertainties have been taken into consideration to help inform the 

estimation of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. 

Given these assumptions and limitations, numerical groundwater models like PGFM and PSTM should be 

considered insight tools and qualitative predictors of future conditions. Therefore, important planning 

decisions that are informed by output from PGFM and PSTM should be made with an understanding of the 

uncertainty in, and sensitivity to, model input parameters and consider other site data, professional 

judgment and inclusion of safety factors. 

15.5.2 Mine Planning Assumptions 

The mine planning simulations were conducted to gain insight into a trench and extraction-well layout that 

may be needed to achieve the extraction flow and K
+
 concentration targets during future mining operations. 

The following subsections describe these targets and the basic infrastructure assumptions inherent in the 

forecast simulations. 

15.5.2.1 Brine Extraction Flow and Concentration Targets 

The brine extraction flow and K
+
 concentration targets are equivalent to 29,946 gpm (1,889 L/s) at an average 

K
+
 concentration of 2,240 mg/L continuously entering the pre-concentration ponds. The extraction flow and 

K
+
 concentration targets equate to 310,000 STPY (282,000 MTPY) of K2SO4 equivalent mass conveyed to the 

pre-concentration ponds (multiply K
+
 concentration or mass by 2.2289 to convert from K

+
 to K2SO4-equivalent

terms). This annual tonnage target equates to 9.33 million short tons (8.46 million metric tonnes) of K2SO4-

equivalent mass delivered to the pre-concentration ponds over the 30-year mine life. 

15.5.2.2 Trenches 

Extraction of the target ions is achieved by operating extraction and gravity-recharge trenches excavated into 

the marl clay and operating extraction wells screened in the siliceous clay and lower marl clay. The trenches 

are assumed to be 20 feet (6.1 meters) deep with an effective width of 8 feet (2.4 meters). Thus, the trenches 

cut through the fat clay and penetrate a portion of the upper marl clay; thereby, allowing fresh water to 

infiltrate the recharge trenches and enters the brine aquifer to be recovered at extraction trenches. 

To facilitate gravity recharge, levels of brine initially residing in the recharge trenches are reduced before 

recharge begins. This is accomplished by initially extracting brine from the recharge trenches and conveying 

this brine to the nearby extraction trench or main canal until the marl clay has been dewatered to 15 feet 

(4.6 meters) bgs. 

15.5.2.3 Extraction Wells 

As previously stated, extraction of the target ions from the siliceous clay and lower marl clay is achieved by 

operating extraction wells targeting depth intervals therein. Extraction wells are equipped with electric 

submersible pumps and discharge piping that conveys extracted brine into the nearest extraction trench or to 

the main canal. Extraction wells are drilled throughout the Playa approximately 400 to 2,600 feet (121.9 to 

792.5 meters) apart, and at a separation distance from the extraction trenches of at least 130 feet (38.6 

meters).  

The extraction wells are used to augment extraction of brine with higher K
+
 concentrations after trench 

operations begin to dilute brine grade in the marl clay. In concept, these wells are drilled and operated as 

needed for blending to maintain extraction flow and K
+
 concentration targets. The nominal depths of the 

extraction wells are 60 to 110 feet (18.5 to 33.5 meters) based on the nominal depth to the base of the 

siliceous clay. The extraction wells are screened from 3.28 feet (1 meter) above the bottom of the siliceous 

clay to the lower 10 feet (3 meters) of the marl clay; a typical screened interval of around 50 feet (15.2 

meters). Extraction wells are 6 inches (15.2 centimeters) in diameter.  

15.5.2.4 Sequencing of Mining Operations 

The trenches and extraction wells are operated with the goal of achieving the target annual brine flow and K
+
 

concentrations to the pre-concentration ponds. To facilitate mine planning, the Playa was divided into BMUs 

based primarily on hydraulic properties. BMU boundaries were defined such that most of a BMU had a 

similar magnitude of hydraulic conductivity with similar hydraulic performances of trenches within the BMU. 

The boundaries of the 21 BMUs are shown in Figure ‎15-9; note that BMUs are numbered BMU1 through 

BMU22, with the BMU12 label not being used.  

Initial brine extraction from a BMU is at the initial average K
+
 concentration adjacent to the extraction 

trenches within the BMU during the period when mobile-phase brine is extracted. The K
+
 concentration of 

the extracted brine decreases over time, as the target Mineral Resource is mined out and mass transfer of K
+
 

mass from the immobile porosity into the mobile porosity becomes diffusion-limited. Thus, construction of 

trenches and extraction wells in BMUs is phased during mining operations. As K
+
 concentrations extracted at

Novopro Projects Inc. 

a BMU decrease, subsequent trenches and extraction wells in other BMUs are brought online to help 

maintain extraction flow and K
+
 concentrations of extracted brine.  

Two types of sequencing strategies are envisioned for mine operations. The first and more typical type of 

sequencing strategy includes turning on extraction and recharge trenches at select BMUs and leaving them 

on throughout the mine life. This strategy is implemented in lower-permeability areas of the marl clay with 

higher brine grades because flushing Mineral Resource from these areas is more challenging and takes longer 

than needed in more-permeable areas. The second type of sequencing strategy follows a "sweep and rest" 

strategy. With this strategy, extraction of brine continues until K
+
 concentrations in the BMU decrease to 

below beneficial levels, at which time brine extraction from the marl clay within that BMU is suspended by 

turning off selected extraction trenches. The recharge trenches in the BMU will continue to infiltrate fresh 

water as conditions allow, replenishing the available groundwater storage with fresh water. This "rest" 

period will allow additional residence time of recharged fresh water in that BMU; thereby, facilitating 

additional mass transfer of Mineral Resource from the immobile porosity into the mobile porosity where it 

can be extracted during subsequent "sweep" periods.  

The sequencing strategy for the siliceous clay extraction wells is to gradually install and operate them as 

needed to maintain extraction flow and K
+
 concentrations of extracted brine. After Mineral Resources in a 

BMU have been substantially depleted, operation and modification of individual trenches and extraction 

wells could be implemented to improve Mineral Resource recovery during later stages of the mine life. For 

example, if K
+
 concentrations in a specific extraction trench fall below target within a BMU, then the 

extraction trench gates connected to the main canal could be closed to mitigate its dilution effect on the 

brine feed to the pre-concentration ponds; or additional wells or BMUs could be brought online.

15.5.3 Forecast Modeling Approach 

To conduct the mine plan simulations and fulfill the modeling objectives, the Norwest-CH2M modeling team 

needed to modify the calibrated versions of PGFM and PSTM to represent the extraction and recharge 

trenches and the extraction wells. Following is a description of how the calibrated versions of PGFM and 

PSTM were modified.  

15.5.3.1 Boundary Conditions Representing Trenches 

Diverse types of boundary conditions were investigated to simulate the extraction and recharge trenches. It 

was determined that the MFSF drain and river packages provided a good balance between conceptual 

accuracy and computational efficiency while achieving the modeling objectives. Both the drain and river 

packages allow the user to define the dimensions of the feature being represented. This is important because 

the dimensions of the recharge and extraction trenches will be less than the dimensions of the 82 feet by 

82 feet (25 meters by 25 meters) and larger model cells. Allowing the user to incorporate the dimensions of 

the trenches in the boundary condition allows an appropriate hydraulic conductance to be computed to 

constrain the water exchange between the trench and the surrounding brine aquifer. Furthermore, with 

these boundaries, it is not necessary for the user to define the extraction and recharge flow rates. Instead, 

the model calculates the volumetric rate of water that is removed or recharged based on the stage assigned 

in the boundary condition, the heads in surrounding model cells, the hydraulic conductance of the boundary 

condition, and the aquifer hydraulic conductivity.  

Extraction trenches were simulated using a drain boundary-condition package. The drain package is a one-

way, head-dependent boundary condition at which groundwater can only exit the model domain. This 

package requires input of a drain water elevation (i.e., stage), drain-bed thickness, drain lengths and widths, 

and a drain-bed hydraulic conductivity (Ktrench) value that governs the resistance to water exchange between 

the drain (i.e., the trench) and the surrounding brine aquifer. All drain boundaries were assigned to Model 

Layer 3, representing an upper portion of the marl clay. The drain stage was assigned a value equal to 15 feet 

(4.57 meters) below the modeled Playa surface at each drain boundary cell. This drain stage represents the 

surface-water level that would be maintained within the extraction trench during operation.  

The assigned trench geometries remain constant during the mine planning simulations. Thus, trenches are 

assumed to remain stable during mining operations. Allowances have been included in the Sustaining Capital 

to account for trench maintenance over the LoM that support this assumption. The drain-bed thickness was 

assumed to be 3.28 feet (1 meter) for all drain cells. The Ktrench was set equal to the equivalent fresh water 

hydraulic conductivity (Khfw) value of the model cell in which the drain boundary was assigned. The length and 

width of the drain boundaries were set to 82 feet (25 meters), which is the nominal length dimension of most 

model cells, and to 8 feet (2.4 meters), respectively. Some model cells in the north and south extremes of the 

model have dimensions of 164 feet (50 meters) and 8 feet (2.4 meters). Drain boundary dimensions 

contained in these cells were set accordingly. Selected reaches of extraction trenches were assigned drain 

stages at elevations higher than the Playa surface to deactivate them according to the mine plan, and at 

15 feet (4.6 meters) below the Playa surface to activate or reactivate them, simulating the sweep-and-rest 

sequencing of trench operations. 

Recharge trenches were simulated using a river boundary-condition package, which is a two-way, head-

dependent boundary condition at which groundwater can enter or exit the model domain. The river package 

requires input of a river stage, river lengths and widths, and a Ktrench that governs the resistance to water 

exchange between the river (i.e. trench) and the surrounding brine aquifer, and a K
+
 concentration for the

Novopro Projects Inc. 

recharge water in the recharge trench. All river boundaries were assigned to Model Layer 3, representing an 

upper portion of the marl clay. The river stage was set to a constant value of 4,513 feet (1,375.6 meters) 

above NAVD88, Geoid 12a. This stage represents a value of 3.3 feet (1 meter) below the lowest modeled 

Playa surface in the model domain. The Ktrench value was set equal to the equivalent fresh water K value of 

the model cell in which the river boundary was located. The length and width of river boundaries were set 

equal to the nominal width and length dimension of model cells, most of which are 82 feet (25 meters) in 

length and 8 feet (2.4 meters) in width. Some model cells in the north and south extremes of the model have 

dimensions of 164 feet (50 meters) and 8 feet (2.4 meters). River boundary dimensions contained in these 

cells were set accordingly. The Ktrench was set to zero at cells representing selected inactive reaches of 

recharge trenches during selected stress periods to simulate the sweep-and-rest sequencing of the mine 

plan. The K
+
 concentration of recharge water was set to a value of 16.4 mg/L, which represents the K

+
 

concentration measured in Sevier River water. 

15.5.3.2 Boundary Conditions Representing Extraction Wells 

Extraction wells were also simulated using a drain boundary-condition package. All drain boundaries 

representing extraction wells were assigned to Model Layer 6 representing most of the siliceous clay. The 

drain stage was assigned a value equal to 3.3 feet (1 meter) above the bottom of Model Layer 6, and 

represents the maximum drawdown allowed within a highly efficient extraction well with the pump intake 

set to this level. The drain-bed thickness was set at 3.3 feet (1 meter), and the drain-bed hydraulic 

conductivity (Kwell) was set to 1,000 ft/d (305 m/d), which represents a high-permeability gravel pack installed 

around the well screen. The length and width of each drain boundary was set to 0.443 feet (0.135 meters), 

which equates to an area equivalent to that of a 6-inch (15.2-centimeter) diameter extraction well (i.e., 182.4 

cm²; 28.3 in²).  

The drain package was selected to simulate siliceous clay extraction wells, as opposed to a well package, 

because drain assignments do not require the user to know, a priori, what each extraction well could 

hydraulically produce. When operating many proximal extraction wells, the hydraulic interferences could be 

significant. These interferences result in less available drawdown within affected extraction wells; less 

available drawdown can result in less hydraulic production from the affected extraction wells. When 

attempting to simulate hundreds of extraction wells within the siliceous clay, it was found to be impractical 

to assign well-by-well pumping rates that would be sustainable considering heterogeneity and hydraulic 

interferences. Simulating extraction wells with the drain package allows for well production to decrease over 

time as available drawdown decreases. 

The Norwest-CH2M modeling team also explored the possible use of a more advanced well package available 

in MFSF, known as the fracture-well package. With this package, the model can automatically reduce 

assigned extraction rates so that simulated water levels within the modeled extraction well are maintained at 

or above a certain elevation. However, when the modeling team used the fracture-well package, model 

stability issues (i.e., the ability of the model to efficiently solve the governing flow and transport equations 

without crashing) ensued and the simulation times became prohibitive. Trial simulations indicated that it was 

more efficient to use the drain package, with which the model internally calculates the volumetric flow rate 

that reports to the drain cells representing the siliceous clay extraction wells. With this approach, extraction 

wells were added or removed as individual well production decreased to achieve the target flow rates rather 

than directly assigning extraction rates at individual extraction wells.

15.5.4 Forecast Modeling Results 

The forecast modeling resulted in hundreds of simulations that varied the layout and sequencing of trenches 

and extraction wells. This modeling endeavor focused on maximizing the extractability of K
+
 relative to the 

production targets, while deferring CAPEX and OPEX to the extent practical. 

15.5.4.1 Model Forecasts 

The results of the mine plan simulations are shown in Figure ‎15-10 and Figure ‎15-11.  

Figure ‎15-10 shows the forecast annual average rate of brine extraction flow and the associated annual 

average K
+
 concentration. Figure ‎15-11 shows the forecast annual K2SO4-equivalent mass in units of million 

tonnes delivered to the pre-concentration ponds and the cumulative extracted K2SO4-equivalent mass 

extracted from the Playa, over the 30-year LoM. These figures show the Project initially exceeding the 

tonnage and extraction flow targets in the mine plan simulation. This occurs because, when the extraction 

trench boundary conditions are activated, the model removes brine to immediately lower the water level to 

15 feet (4.6 meters) below the modeled Playa surface at each drain boundary cell. In reality, extraction-water 

levels in trenches would decrease more gradually. Simulating these shorter-term transient responses at the 

start of a given stress period was investigated, but the time for the modeling team to implement "ramp-up" 

periods did not add appreciable value to the long-term forecasts. Nevertheless, it should be understood that 

the recharge-extraction infrastructure would not in reality be operated at extraction flow rates that exceed 

the pre-concentration pond capacity. 

Although the modeled recharge trenches are brought online to facilitate mass transfer of immobile Mineral 

Resource to the mobile phase, and extraction wells are gradually brought online, the K
+
 concentration 

decreases over time due to dilution in the marl clay. The forecast cumulative K2SO4-equivalent mass from the 

30-year mine plan simulation is approximately 8.525 million short tons (7.734 million metric tonnes), which is 

approximately 91% of the 9.33 million short tons (8.46 million metric tonnes) target. The forecast cumulative 

K2SO4-equivalent mass remains at or above the target level for the first 20 years of the mine plan, after which 

time there is a reduction in annual production of K2SO4-equivalent mass from the Playa to the end of the 

mine life. The associated operations schedule for the trenches and wells is summarized in Table ‎15-5 and 

Table ‎15-6, respectively. The layouts of the trench and extraction-well networks are shown in Figure ‎15-12 

and Figure ‎15-13, respectively.  

It should be noted that the forecast cumulative K2SO4 mass of 8.525 million short tons (7.734 million metric 

tonnes) represents what this trench and extraction well build-out and schedule is capable of producing over 

the 30-year LoM simulation. Simulated brine grade and flow rates shown in Figure ‎15-10 fluctuate around 

the target values over the first 20 years; however, these fluctuations will be balanced to meet the target 

brine grade and flow rate to meet the pre-concentration pond requirements as part of mine planning and 

development efforts during future implementation phases. The brine K
+
 grade will naturally decay after mine 

year 20 due to the influx of recharge water. Figure ‎15-14 shows predicted annual and cumulative K2SO4-

equivalent mass after balancing the simulated production. Production balancing was accomplished 

arithmetically while maintaining the mass balance produced from the mine plan simulation. 

The trench and extraction-well layouts under full build-out conditions equate to 733 miles 

(1,179.7 kilometers) of trenches and canals and 2,366 extraction wells.

Figure ‎15-15 and Figure ‎15-16 show the forecast rates of annual groundwater inflow and outflow, 

respectively, for the 30-year mine plan simulation. Review of these two figures indicates that groundwater 

inflows and outflows associated with the trenches, canals, and wells represent the largest components of the 

overall groundwater balance, as would be expected. These figures are consistent with Table ‎15-6, which 

indicates the growing reliance on siliceous clay extraction wells as mining operations proceed during the 30-

year mine life (note in Figure ‎15-16 the increasing groundwater discharge to extraction wells and the 

corresponding decrease in groundwater discharge to the extraction canal and trenches). Groundwater 

exchange between the Playa aquifer and the surrounding colluvial aquifer, areal groundwater recharge from 

precipitation, evapotranspiration of shallow groundwater, and groundwater discharge to recharge trenches is 

forecast to be small. This is because groundwater outflow to the extraction canal and trenches and to the 

extraction wells would largely be offset by inflow from recharge trenches. The total mass balance errors for 

flow and mass transport, at the end of the simulation, were -0.05% and -0.10%, respectively, which are well 

under commonly-accepted model mass balance error percentages. 

Comparisons of the forecast extraction-trench flows and their associated modeled lengths indicate average 

annual flows ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 gpm/ft (0.007 to 0.037 (m
3
/h)/m) of extraction trench. Comparisons 

of the forecast extraction-well flows and the sequencing of these wells listed in Table ‎15-6 also indicates 

average annual extraction-well flows ranging from 0.3 to 18 gpm (0.07 to 4.1 m
3
/h) per extraction well, with a 

decrease in gpm per extraction well as more wells are brought online. This decrease in the gpm per 

extraction well occurs because of increased hydraulic interferences that occur in the model as new extraction 

wells are brought online. Thus, the model suggests that, although the overall combined extraction-well flow 

increases as new extraction wells are brought online, the average flow rate per extraction well decreases as 

the density of operating extraction wells increases. 

Figure ‎15-17, Figure ‎15-18 and Figure ‎15-19 show plan views of the forecast immobile K
+
 concentrations in 

the marl clay after 10, 20, and 30 years of mining operations. These figures show the forecast amount of K
+
 

Resource remaining in the clay matrix at these three simulation times. As shown in these figures, a large 

portion of the modeled area has remaining immobile K
+
 concentrations on the order of 1,500 mg/L or less 

after 30 years of mine operations; thereby providing a sense of potential sweep effectiveness associated with 

the mine plan. The modeled operation areas include a few sub-areas where the remaining immobile K
+
 

concentrations are greater than 1,500 mg/L. These sub-areas are primarily in the lower-permeability area in 

the marl clay north of Needle Point. The trenches in the lower-permeability area are modeled as coming 

online at the start of mining operations (see Table ‎15-5). Because the goal is to extract as much K
+
 as possible 

relative to the extraction targets, the trenches and extraction wells at BMUs in which low-permeability areas 

with higher initial K
+
 concentrations exist were turned on at the beginning of the mine plan simulation to 

maximize recovery in those BMUs. Modeling results suggest that extracting additional K
+
 from these BMUs 

would require running the associated trenches and extraction wells longer than 30 years and/or decreasing 

the spacing between recharge and extraction infrastructure in these BMUs.

15.6 Potassium Reserve Estimate  

The FS has demonstrated that the Project is economically viable and is presented in ‎Item 22: Economic 

Analysis. As a result of the favorable economic results presented in the FS, output from the production 

simulations using the numerical models described above was tabulated and analyzed to calculate the 

quantity of potassium Reserves to the end of the 30-year production period. Only in-place Measured plus 

Indicated Mineral Resources described in ‎Item 14: Mineral Resource Estimates were used in this analysis. 

There are two categories of Mineral Reserves delineated by this study. These are: 

 Available Mineral Reserves: defined as those Mineral Reserves estimated prior to losses due to 

evaporation pond and processing factors. 

 Produced Mineral Reserves: which are net Mineral Reserves estimated, including losses due to 

evaporation pond and processing factors. 

Note that Mineral Reserves produced through the recharge and mass transfer processes are not included in 

the in-place Mineral Resource, but are included in the Mineral Reserve estimate below. 

15.6.1 Mineral Reserve Statement 

Available Mineral Reserves are defined as the quantities of potassium contained in brine that is technically 

extractable from the Playa and delivered to the first solar evaporation pond. These values were calculated 

using the numerical model outputs from the mine plan simulation described previously and categorized by 

level of assurance into Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves of K
+
 and equivalent K2SO4 tonnages are 

summarized in Table ‎15-7 and Table ‎15-8.  

Proven Mineral Reserves from trench production in the marl clay were calculated as the K
+
 tonnage 

contained in the mobile porosity within the marl clay over the area encompassing Measured Mineral 

Resource over all BMUs. Brine grade for the Proven Mineral Reserves in the marl clay is determined in the 

same manner. The brine grade for the Proven Mineral Reserves is assumed to be the same as the average 

grade for the Measured Mineral Resource in the marl clay. Probable Mineral Reserves in the marl clay are the 

remaining marl clay production from the mine plan simulation that consist of production from the mobile 

porosity over the Indicated Mineral Resource area, and production due to the mass transfer process. Due to 

the introduction of recharge water during mining, the brine grade of the Probable Mineral Reserves is diluted 

over the LoM. Average brine grade for the Probable Mineral Reserves in the marl clay was calculated by 

dividing the tonnage of Probable Mineral Reserves by the total volume of brine produced from the extraction 

trenches over the LoM minus the volume of Proven Mineral Reserve brine. Proven and Probable Mineral 

Reserves in the marl clay are estimated to be 475,351 and 2,061,668 K
+
 short tons (431,232 and 1,870,316 K

+
 

metric tonnes), respectively. The average Proven K
+
 grade in the marl clay is 3,070 mg/L. The average 

Probable K
+
 grade in the marl clay is 1,447 mg/L. 

Proven Mineral Reserves of K
+
 in the siliceous clay were determined from the volume of the sand and gravel 

units in the siliceous clay area, encompassing a 656-foot (200-meter) buffer around the mine plan Production 

Wells in the Measured Mineral Resource area, multiplied by a sand and gravel specific yield of 22.8%. The 

brine grade for the Proven Mineral Reserves is assumed to be the same as the average grade for the 

Measured Mineral Resource in the siliceous clay. Average LoM brine grade for the Proven Mineral Reserves in 

the siliceous clay is 2,777 mg/L K
+
. The remaining production from the siliceous clay wells in the mine plan 

simulation is assigned the Probable Mineral Reserves category. Probable Mineral Reserves in the siliceous

clay include primary production from the area of Indicated Mineral Resource, production from the non-sand 

and gravel fraction of this unit, vertical leakage of brine from the lower marl clay, and mass transfer of K
+
 

from the immobile porosity. Average brine grade for the Probable Mineral Reserves in the siliceous clay was 

calculated by dividing the mass of Probable Mineral Reserves by the total volume of brine produced from the 

extraction wells over the LoM minus the volume of Proven Mineral Reserve brine. Average LoM brine grade 

for the Probable Mineral Reserves in the siliceous clay is 1,647 mg/L K
+
. Proven and Probable Mineral 

Reserves in the siliceous clay are estimated to be 43,529 and 912,120 K
+
 short tons (39,488 and 827,462 K

+
 

metric tonnes), respectively. 

The tonnages of K
+
 produced from the fat clay are assigned to the Probable Mineral Reserves category. 

Simulated production in the fat clay is primarily from the initial trench excavation and from some mass 

transfer at the fat clay/marl clay interface. Probable Mineral Reserves in the fat clay are estimated to be 

332,894 K
+
 short tons (301,997 K

+ 
metric tonnes). The average fat clay brine grade of Probable Mineral 

Reserves is the same as the brine grade of the Mineral Resources, 3,120 mg/L K
+
.

 Reserves together total 3.826 million short tons (3.471 million metric

tonnes). 

The target brine grade of 2,240 mg/L is forecast to be maintained for approximately 20 years of Playa 

production. Following that period, the dilutive impacts of fresh water through the recharge system will cause 

the run-of-mine grade delivered from the Playa into the pre-concentration ponds to decay. It is anticipated 

that the grade will decline by approximately 5% per year for the remaining simulation period. The expected

decline has been accounted for in the pond and process design, and in projected pond and process 

efficiencies by Novopro, and is accounted for in these estimated Available Potassium Reserves. 

Norwest used a process recovery factor provided by Novopro of 79.79% to convert from Available Mineral 

Reserves to Produced Mineral Reserves. The process recovery factor accounts for leakage losses, process 

efficiency, evaporation, and entrainment, and is described in detail in ‎Item 17: Recovery Methods. Produced 

Mineral Reserves are estimated to be approximately 6.8 million short tons (6.17 million metric tonnes).

15.7 Summary and Conclusions 

The FS has demonstrated that the Project is economically viable. As a result of the favorable economic results 

presented in the FS, in-place Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources have been upgraded to Proven and 

Probable Mineral Reserves. Numerical groundwater flow and transport models have been developed that 

integrate hydrogeologic information collected over the last several years to improve the understanding of the 

groundwater flow and transport components of the conceptual model of the Playa aquifer system. This 

integrated groundwater flow and transport model provided a numerical framework to support the 

development of the mine plan. The mine plan consists of a conceptual design layout and sequencing of marl 

clay trenches and siliceous clay extraction wells that may be required to achieve SOP-production targets 

during a 30-year mine life. 

The forecast simulations indicate that the proposed mine plan, with the noted configuration and modeling 

assumptions, could meet the brine-extraction targets for approximately two-thirds of the 30-year mine life. 

According to the model, this may require operation of 733 miles (1,180 kilometers) of recharge and 

extraction trenches and canals and 2,366 extraction wells at full build-out. Modeling indicates that there is a 

decrease in annual average K
+
 concentration due to dilution of the mobile-phase brine as fresh water is 

recharged into the marl clay. It is anticipated that the brine grade will decline by approximately 5% per year 

for the remaining simulation period. The expected decline has been accounted for in the pond and process 

design and projected pond and process efficiencies by Novopro and is accounted for in these estimated 

Available Mineral Reserves of potassium. The Mineral Reserve figures reported in the FS and this technical 

report will support the annual SOP production profile over the life of the Project. 

The accuracy of Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity of 

available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Elements of the study that 

form the basis of the Mineral Reserve estimation include sampling and analytical methodology, the 

hydrostratigraphic model construction and understanding of brine and sediment properties and variability, 

and the construction and calibration of the integrated groundwater flow and mass transport numerical

models. These tasks were performed in succession, with standard validation and calibration exercises 

performed throughout each stage, culminating in the integrated numerical models from which the Mineral 

Reserve estimations have been sourced. This has led to a reasonable level of confidence that the Sevier Playa 

will be able to produce the quantities and grade of brine presented as Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves 

in this Report. 

Given the data available at the time this Technical Report was prepared, the estimates presented herein are 

considered reasonable. However, they should be accepted with the understanding that additional data and 

analysis available subsequent to the date of the estimates may necessitate revision. These revisions may be 

material. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the estimated Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves 

will be recoverable. 

The ability to produce the estimated quantity of Mineral Reserves stated herein is dependent upon the 

successful execution of the Cooperative Development Agreement between Peak Minerals and LUMA.  

While there has been no decision by the state and federal agencies formally creating a Unit Agreement, it is 

likely to be successfully adopted given that BLM was the originator of the unitized approach to the liquid 

mineral commodity and it is supported by BLM, SITLA, Emerald Peak, CPM, and LUMA. Peak has worked for 

numerous years on the permitting process for the Project and has progressed to the point of triggering the 

required EIA for the Project. There are no known impediments to the successful completion of the EIA at the 

time of this Report. While there are still stages of the permitting process to be addressed prior to receiving 

notice to proceed from the state and federal authorities, no known elements of the project would impede 

this process. Additionally, there are no known obstacles, including legal, title, tax, socioeconomic, or political, 

that would prevent the successful initiation of the proposed work.

ITEM 16: MINING METHODS 

16.1 Overview 

The proposed mining method for the collection of naturally-occurring brine from the sedimentary basin of 

the Sevier Playa involves a combination of stepped extraction trenches and drilled wells to collect the sub-

surface brine. The brine is conveyed into a series of solar evaporation and concentration ponds located on 

the surface of the Playa. The larger pre-concentration ponds are located in the northeastern portion of the 

Sevier Playa with the production ponds located in the southern portion of the Sevier Playa, with adjacent 

TMAs. Refer to the sections that follow for discussions on mine layout, extraction methodology, and 

construction methods, as well as supporting infrastructure.  

16.2 Mine Layout 

The proposed layout of the mine facilities is illustrated in Figure ‎16-1. In general, the mine design consists of 

the following four major components: 

 Brine extraction system consisting of canals, trenches and wells 

 Recharge system consisting of canals, collectors and trenches 

 Series of evaporation ponds 

 TMA 

The extraction and recharge trenches are placed throughout the Playa and their spacing and direction varies 

depending on permeability, conductivity, and/or concentration of the brine. The Playa is divided into mining 

units, referred to as BMUs. There are 21 BMUs; BMU1 to BMU11, and BMU13 to BMU22. Each BMU unit 

consists of extraction trenches, recharge trenches, recharge collectors, and extraction wells. Refer to Figure 

‎16-1 for a general arrangement of trenches, canals, wells, and Playa features, along with the location of the 

various BMUs. 

The extraction trenches within each BMU are connected to the extraction canal to facilitate direct flow. 

There are provisions in place to enable the operator to shut down the brine flow from a BMU to the 

extraction canal during operational shut-in phases. The brine flow from the extraction trenches is shut down 

by creating a blockage/plug at or near the point where the extraction trench feeds into the extraction canal. 

This blockage/plug is created by an excavator or dozer placing adjacent berm or spoil material from the 

trench excavation into the extraction trench. Sufficient material is placed so as to prevent brine flowing from 

the extraction trench into the extraction canal. 

The recharge system consists of a diversion structure from the Sevier River to a distribution point. The 

distribution point directs the flow into both east and west recharge canals. The recharge water is introduced 

to each BMU through a series of recharge trenches and recharge collectors. The BMUs on the west side of 

the main extraction canal are recharged from the west recharge canal. Likewise, the BMUs on the east side of 

the extraction canal are recharged from the east recharge canal. Flows from the recharge canals to the 

recharge collector trenches of each BMU are controlled by valves in the side of the recharge canal. Refer to 

Figure ‎16-2 for typical designs.

Evaporation ponds are designed to contain the produced brine for the solar evaporation process. The berm 

embankments are designed to capture the precipitated salts in each of the pond systems. For the pre-

concentration ponds in the north, the salts are stored in place and the berms rise over time. These periodic 

raises match the deposition of the salts. In the south, production ponds remain at their initial elevation for 

the LoM considering that the precipitate products are collected and trucked to the Processing Plant for 

beneficiation.  

Tailings are stored in three main areas. Type 1 tailings develop as precipitation occurs through the 

evaporation process. Type 1 tailings are generally halite and stored in the pre-concentration ponds located in 

the north of the Playa. A bitterns brine stream makes up the Type 2 tailings and they are stored in a sealed 

berm area in the southwestern portion of the Playa. Type 3 tailings, or Processing Plant flotation stream 

tailings, are managed in an on-site TMA through direct placement within a sealed berm. 

16.3 Mine Design – Extraction Canal and Trenches 

The extraction trench system includes a central extraction brine canal that is fed by lateral extraction 

trenches. 

Extraction trenches collect and discharge brine into the extraction canal, which conveys brine to a barge-

mount pump lift-station located in a sump at the north end of the extraction canal adjacent to the pre-

concentration ponds. The extraction canal is sloped from south to north to allow for gravity drainage. The 

dimensions of the canal allow for both flow of the brine solution and minor sedimentation over the life of the 

Project. To the south, the canal is slightly smaller as the collected flows are not as great, and it is larger to the 

north to allow for increasing capacity. 

The side walls of the trenches are series of stepped benches excavated until reaching the top portion of the 

marl zone as shown in see Figure ‎16-3. Refer to Figure ‎16-4 for a typical cross section of the extraction 

trenches.

16.4 Mine Design – Recharge Canal and Trenches 

The recharge system introduces fresh water into the extraction system to maintain continuous brine 

extraction over time. The proposed design includes a diversion structure above the inlet to the Sevier Playa. 

The river flow is diverted into a sump that allows the water to enter the east, west, or both canals at different 

flow rates. The diversion structure consists of a low, earth-filled diversion berm located across the existing 

river channel at the edge of the Sevier Playa and immediately downstream of the diversion point.  

These canal slopes are typical for large irrigation canals in flat terrain. Once the canal reaches the southern 

portion of the Playa, the topography takes on an adverse grade and a series of lift stations is required on both 

the recharge canals to ensure that adequate water is available to the various BMUs.  

Recharge trenches are spaced in the BMUs as illustrated in Figure ‎16-5. The recharge system also includes 

collector canals that feed trenches branching off to the east and west recharge canals.  

For recharge trenches, the side walls of the recharge trenches are vertical and separated by benches until 

reaching the top portion of the marl zone. See Figure ‎16-4.  

16.4.1 Recharge Water 

Recharge of water into the subsurface extraction zone is required for sustainable long-term operation to 

achieve the target brine production rate. At a minimum, the amount of recharge water required must equal 

the target Playa brine extraction rate of 48,339 ac-ft/yr or 29,946 gpm (59,625,189.7 m
3
/yr). Sources of 

recharge water consist of stream inflow from the Sevier River to the Playa, runoff from watersheds 

surrounding the Sevier Playa, precipitation directly onto the surface of the Playa, and mountain-block 

recharge (i.e., subsurface inflow). 

The FS included an evaluation and modeling exercise that estimated annual rates of natural water flow to the 

Playa to facilitate forecasting annual purchase water requirements during a 31-year LoM, and to gain insights 

into risk factors that may lead to source-water shortfalls. 

The general approach to accomplish the above objectives consisted of modeling the water balance over the 

31‐year period from 1985 through 2015, assuming the Project had been operational during this period. This 

modeled historical water balance approach assumed that the previous 31 years of climate data represent 

typical conditions that could occur during the future 31‐year mining period.

In summary, to support brine extraction, purchase‐water agreements between 18,000 and 49,000 ac‐ft/yr 

(22,202,640 and 60,440,520 m
3
/yr) of water may be required. The average amount of purchased recharge 

water required during non-surplus and small-surplus flow years (accounting for 10% transmission loss) is 

39,028 ac-ft (48,140,257.4 m
3
). The FS assumes that 39,028 ac-ft (48,140,257.4 m

3
) of recharge water is 

purchased annually over the life of the Project. 

16.5 Mine Design – Wells 

Wells are used to extract brine from the lower siliceous clay horizon and extend into the overlying lower marl 

clay. PGFM modeling of the MCZ and SCZ are based on the parameters established from field pumping tests 

and results from TtT and WtW testing (2015). Well flows are used to achieve the desired discharge of 

approximately 30,000 gpm (6,813.8 m
3
/h). Over the life of the Project, a maximum of approximately 

2,366 wells are required. These are 6-inch (15.2-centimeter) diameter wells drilled to the full thickness of the 

siliceous clay. The wells are located in areas of the Playa where the maximum flow of the highest 

concentration brine from the siliceous clay zone is produced. Figure ‎16-6 shows the distribution of the wells 

over the Project's life. 

A typical section of an extraction well is presented in Figure ‎16-7. Based on maps of the total depth of the 

LRZ, it is determined that the average depth of wells is approximately 75 feet (22.9 meters), although it is 

recognized that the well depths vary from 50 to 100 feet (15.2 to 30.5 meters). The wells will likely be 

screened from the bottom of the siliceous clay to the lower 10 feet (3 meters) of the MCZ, typically 50 feet 

(15.2 meters). Once the brine is pumped to the surface, the flow rate at each well is monitored. The well 

discharge is piped to the nearest point for discharge to either an extraction trench or extraction canal. 

The wells are pumped via downhole submersible pumps. These pumps are specified based on the anticipated 

or modeled groundwater flows. Pumping rates range from under 5 gpm (1.1 m
3
/h) to over 15 gpm (3.4 m

3
/h) 

and are categorized into three general duty categories. Refer to Table ‎16-1 for the number of pumps, at a 

given flow rate.

16.6 Tailings Storage 

Three types of tailings are anticipated to be generated by the evaporation ponds and Processing Plant: 

 Type 1: Tailing salts generated in the pre-concentration ponds (in the form of halite, bloedite 

(Na2Mg(SO4)2·4H2O), gypsum, and polyhalite (K2Ca2Mg(SO4)4·2H2O). Type 1 tailing salts are stored in 

the base of the pre-concentration ponds and the berms are periodically raised over the LoM to 

increase storage capacity.  

 Type 2: Purge brine (aka bitterns brine) is removed pre-harvest from the final evaporation pond 

stage and contains high concentrations of dissolved MgCl2 with low levels of potassium. Type 2 

tailings are pumped from the final production ponds to the waste product storage facility's purge 

brine storage ponds located on the Playa, west of the production ponds. 

 Type 3: Tailings (filter cake with 20% moisture content) generated from the Processing Plant consists 

of a high solids concentration (> 80%) of halite, epsomite (MgSO4·7H2O) and leftover potassium-

bearing salt, as well as other impurities (such as insolubles [dust] removed during the scrubbing 

process). Type 3 tailings are trucked as a filtered-solids material from the Processing Plant flotation 

circuit to the waste product storage facility's tailings storage facility. 

16.6.1 Pre-Concentration Pond Salt – Type 1 Tailings 

Type 1 tailings are generated from the initial precipitation of salt within the pre-concentration ponds, 

consisting almost entirely of halite, given its early brine concentration phase crystallization. Pre-

concentration pond precipitates are considered tailings in that they separate the valuable fraction of the 

Available K2SO4 Reserve from the uneconomic fraction (gangue, or halite) contained within the brine. Type 1 

tailings are significant in that they far exceed the volume of Type 2 and Type 3 tailings.  

The pre-concentration pond berms are built during initial stage construction, starting in Year -4. They are 

constructed from common fill, capped with a layer of impermeable fill on the top and embayment side of the 

berm. The berms are raised in successive lifts as the thickness of the precipitated halite grows and decreases 

the distance from the brine surface to the berm top. Figure ‎16-8 shows the pre-concentration plan view. 

Figure ‎16-9 provides a perspective view of pre-concentration ponds. 

It should be noted that the lifts in ponds P-3 through P-10 are staged to occur on yearly cycles after the initial 

capital buildout. This continues and paces with the precipitate deposition within each pond, although Years 

17 through 26 have a declining brine grade, and are hence a slower deposition rate. The slower deposition 

rate translates to a reduced berm raise buildout requirement for the berms. This lower buildout rate is 

reflected in the reduced annual raise requirements.

16.6.2 Purge Brine Storage Pond – Type 2 Tailings 

The Type 2 tailings stored in the purge brine storage pond function as final tailings evaporation ponds with 

the ponds being filled over the 4 to 5-month summer evaporation/production season. The pond design 

includes a freeboard allowance for carry‐over of some unevaporated fluid following the production season, 

as well as containment of year-round precipitation. As the height of brine rises to fill the containment pond 

as the operational years proceed, the associated purge brine storage pond expansions are constructed. The 

purge brine storage pond design incorporates a 5-foot (1.5-meter) minimum freeboard during all stages of 

operation.  

Figure ‎16-9 shows the configuration of the purge brine storage pond at its projected, full footprint. The final 

footprint area of the purge brine storage pond is 746 acres (301.9 hectares) and is designed to store the 

Type 2 purge brine production for the life of the Project.

The containment berms are built in two stages, handling the initial two-year volume, and then another three 

sides are added to support Years 1 through 5. Following the expansion at Year 5, the berms are lifted around 

the entire perimeter to support the annual volume requirements.  

16.6.3 Process Tailings Storage – Type 3 Tailings 

The configuration of the tailings storage facility (Type 3 process tailings-filter cake) at its projected, full 

footprint is shown in Figure ‎16-9. The final footprint area of the tailings storage facility is 543 acres 

(219.7 hectares) and is designed to store the Type 3 tailings production for the life of the Project.  

Figure ‎16-10 shows the typical cross sections for the tailings storage facility as the facility is expanded to 

increase storage capacity. The typical cross sections show the materials that make up the storage facility.

16.7 Brine Mining Unit Description 

A single BMU is a discrete area of the Playa with the following components: 

 Extraction trenches, orientated and spaced determined by brine concentrations and conductivity. 

 Extraction canal is centrally located to which extraction trenches are connected. 

 Recharge trenches, parallel to and spaced half way between extraction trenches.  

 A recharge canal connected to the recharge trenches on the exterior side of each mining unit.  

 Extraction wells screened through the siliceous clay and/or lower marl clay.  

 Pipe allowing pumped-well brine to be transferred to the extraction trenches. 

The BMUs will be operated to ensure an adequate volume and concentration is supplied to the pre-

concentration ponds. There will be multiple phases of the mining unit cycle. Those phases include initial 

construction, initial extraction, continuous extraction and recharge, and, for limited areas, "sweep and rest" 

cycles. Further discussion of the operating phases can be found in the sections that follow. 

16.8 Brine Mining Unit Operational Phases 

Each BMU will step through multiple operational phases. The goal is to deliver adequate brine volume and 

concentration to the pre-concentration ponds from multiple BMUs. The Process Design Criteria developed by 

Novopro calls for 29,946 gpm (6801.5 m
3
/h), at a K

+
 concentration of 0.204 wt%. The Process Design Criteria 

assumes 95% availability and year-round operation resulting in 8,322 hours per year. Mine operations will 

operate the BMUs so that those parameters can be met. As the BMUs cycle through the phases, individual 

units will be turned on or off to provide a brine flow that meets these criteria. 

16.9 Mine Development Timing and Sequencing 

The mining and operations will commence prior to Plant start-up and prior to being able to operate the 

Processing Plant at full capacity. In order to achieve this timeline, trench excavation will start in Year -4, 

which currently corresponds to calendar Year 2019. Table ‎16-2 further illustrates the milestones as they 

pertain to the calendar and mine year.

16.9.1 Canal Construction and Operation Schedule 

The initial construction of the facilities will include the extraction canal and recharge canals. As discussed 

above, the extraction canal will be the first construction following the start of the evaporation ponds. This 

canal will be approximately 21 miles (33.8 kilometers) long when completed. Following the extraction canal, 

the Sevier River diversion dam and diversion canal, and the two recharge canals, will be started. Due to the 

timing and the need to coordinate the filling of the recharge trenches along the western side of the Playa 

first, the west recharge canal will be started first. The east recharge canal will be constructed second. 

The majority of the extraction canal will be excavated during Year -4 to -3 and this excavation will be from the 

pre-production ponds to the southern end of BMU9 as shown in Figure ‎16-11. The pump and proposed 

discharge pipe arrangement is shown in Figure ‎16-12. 

The recharge canal will consist of two canals; one that follows the western edge of the Playa and one that 

follows the eastern edge of the Playa. The canal along both edges of the Playa will be developed from the 

north to south and will be completed as needed to provide water to the various BMU recharge trenches. The 

initial excavation of these canals will occur during Year -3 to Year -2. Additional excavation will take place 

during Year 0, Year 8, and Year 13 to extend the canals further to the south. Table ‎16-3 lists the total length 

and volume for each type of canal for the initial construction capital buildout.

Once the pre-concentration ponds are constructed and filled, the transfer canal to the production ponds will 

be constructed. Due to the adverse grade, the transfer canal will have five pump lift stations. Table ‎16-3 

presents the length of the transfer canal. The five lift stations are planned to be approximately 15,000 feet 

(4,572 meters) apart along the canal. A typical pump lift station is shown in Figure ‎16-13.

16.9.2 BMU Trench Construction and Operation Schedule 

All timing is based on the start of Plant production. Since there is considerable construction that is necessary 

before brine will be able to be produced, the timing starts with the years before the start of operations.  

As mentioned above, initial development of the extraction trenches will begin in Year -4 and continue 

through Year -1, during which time brine will accumulate in the trenches. Also during this time, the recharge 

trenches will be excavated and brine solution will accumulate in the trenches. At Year 0, the extraction 

trenches will be opened to allow brine to flow into the extraction canal. The brine solution collected in the 

recharge trenches during the initial phase will be pumped into the extraction canal. The brine solution in the 

extraction canal will be pumped into the pre-concentration ponds. As described above, the Playa will operate 

through different phases allowing brine extraction to continue for the life of the mine. During the different 

years, trenches and canals will be excavated, thus allowing sufficient brine solution to reach the pre-

concentration ponds.  

The construction of BMUs will start during Year -4 to Year -3. These areas are: BMU1 to BMU 5, BMU9, 

BMU15, BMU17, and BMU19 to BMU22. Then following this development phase, BMU16 and BMU18 will be 

developed between Year -2 and Year 0. These initial development phases can be seen in Figure ‎16-14.

In addition to the lengths listed in the above table, there will be additional canals that need to be excavated 

for brine or fresh water transfer. These include the extraction canal, brine transfer canal, and recharge 

canals.

16.9.3 Pre-Concentration Ponds 

The pre-concentration ponds are located in the northern portion of the Playa to avoid the high concentration 

areas within the Playa that are situated in the central and southern areas. This placement of the ponds 

permits the maximum area for extraction in the highest-grade areas. 

Brine collected from the extraction system will gravity flow through the extraction canal to a lift station. An 

axial flow pump, mounted on the edge of a collection sump, will provide brine through pipelines into pre-

concentration Pond 1 (P-1). Ten pre-concentration ponds (P-1 through P-10) are actively used for 

evaporation. Pond-to-pond brine transfer is achieved using pumps or weirs, depending on the pond. In 

addition to halite, appreciable amounts of bloedite and trace amounts of gypsum and polyhalite would also 

precipitate in the pre-concentration ponds.  

The entrained brine (heel brine) within ponds P5 through P10 will be recovered as part of the regular pond 

operation. In this operation, the heel brine would drain from the salts through windrowing and then pumped 

to a heel brine holding pond at the adjoining southern side of these ponds. This procedure for P-5 through  

P-10 would only occur during the winter period and would start three years after the start-up of the pre-

concentration ponds.  

Areas of pre-concentration ponds are detailed in Table ‎16-6. A design factor is added to all nominal areas of 

the evaporation ponds to obtain the design area. The total design area is 17,563 acres (7,107.5 hectares) and 

includes the area for the heel brine holding pond.

Accumulation of salts in the pre-concentration ponds is the major driver of berm heights. Berm heights of P-1 

through P-4 include some allowance for the accumulation of brine from October to April. Table ‎16-7 shows 

the incremental height increases needed for each corresponding pond with the accumulation of precipitated 

salts. The berm raises were designed with 1-foot (30.5-centimeter) minimum increase for constructability. 

Table ‎16-8 presents the berms heights required to accommodate the precipitated salts including freeboard. 

Berm heights stated represent the average calculated height of each pond from the Playa topography to the 

top of the berm.

Typical cross sections of the pre-concentration pond berms are presented in Figure ‎16-15. Clay material from 

the Playa would be used to construct the berms using low-ground-pressure dozers and excavators. The 

berms would be compacted to achieve increased stability and decreased permeability.

16.9.4 Brine Transfer Canal and Pipeline 

A pump station, located in P-10, is provided to pump pre-concentrated brine into the brine transfer canal to 

be conveyed to the production ponds. The brine transfer canal would be located adjacent to the perimeter 

road on the east side of the Playa extending from the pre-concentration ponds to the production ponds. A 

profile drawing of a typical brine transfer canal is shown in Figure ‎16-4. Due to the adverse grade, the brine 

transfer canal would have five pump lift stations. A profile view of the brine transfer canal and lift station 

locations is shown in Figure ‎16-16. Refer to Figure ‎16-1 for the locations of these pump and pipeline sites. 

16.9.5 Production Ponds 

The brine that leaves the pre-concentration ponds is transferred through the brine transfer canal and 

pipeline to the production ponds, where potassium-bearing minerals are precipitated and harvested. The 

production ponds are located at the southern end of the Playa as shown in the preceding Playa layout 

drawings such as Figure ‎16-1. Figure ‎16-16 provides a plan view.

The production ponds operate as four parallel series of four ponds each, as shown in Figure ‎16-16. The 

production ponds would be de-brined (using weirs and pumps) and harvested one at a time. Brine from H1, 

H2, and H3 would be transferred into a neighboring pond. The purge brine (Type 2 tailings) from the last 

production pond (H4) would be pumped via a pipeline to the purge brine storage pond.  

Harvesting of crude potassium ore would be conducted year-round. Road graders would be used to windrow 

the deposited salt floor from the production ponds for pickup and delivery to the Processing Plant Facility, 

using a loader and haul trucks. This operation is discussed in more detail in ‎Item 17: Recovery Methods. 

Minerals deposited in the production ponds trap a certain mass of brine, also known as brine entrainment, 

and is accounted for in the design of the ponds. Areas of the production ponds are detailed in Table ‎16-9. A 

design factor is added to all nominal areas of evaporation ponds to obtain the design area. The total nominal 

pond area of the production ponds spans 1,935 acres (783.1 hectares), and the corresponding design area is 

2,711 acres (1,097.1 hectares).

Berm heights for the production ponds is based on the amount of salt deposited in one year, considering that 

a halite base is also present in each pond. Berm heights include transfer capacity and freeboard. Pond-to-

pond brine transfer is done by gravity and pumping, where required. The weir widths presented are for 

individual cells (A/B/C/D) of each pond. 

The berm heights and pond weir widths are summarized in Table ‎16-10. A typical section through the 

production ponds is presented in Figure ‎16-17.

ITEM 17: RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Process Design Criteria 

The Processing Plant is designed to process potassium-bearing minerals recovered from harvesting ponds in 

order to generate SOP. The process is based on the metallurgical testwork conducted in the course of the 

study and is described in ‎Item 13: Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing. The following design 

parameters were based on the usage of 68,760,097 short tons per year (STPY) (62,378,128.6 metric tonnes 

per year [MTPY]) of Playa brine feed to the Project.  

The main criteria for the process design are presented in Table ‎17-1.

The main source of process potassium losses are the ponds; as leakage, entrainment in pre-concentration 

ponds, and as purge brine losses. A small portion of the potassium ends up not being crystallized, and exits

with the purge brine. The other source of losses for the process is in flotation, since even with high product 

recovery, some potassium will report to the flotation tailings. The remaining unit operations of the process 

are very efficient with recycle streams to minimize product losses as much as possible.  

17.2 Process Description 

The process is designed to generate SOP from the evaporation and further treatment of Playa brine.  

Saline brine from the Playa is extracted through trenches distributed on the Playa. The extracted brine is the 

main source of potassium and the only source of sulfate used to produce SOP. The brine also contains 

significant amounts of magnesium, sodium, and chloride. The brine is evaporated in ponds in order to 

recover the potassium-bearing mineral needed to produce SOP. The simplified process description is 

illustrated in Figure ‎17-1. The process is described in detail in the sections that follow.

17.3 Evaporation Ponds Design 

The Project uses solar evaporation ponds to evaporate the Playa brine to produce crude potash salts. The 

crude potash salts are then harvested by mobile harvesters and discharged to the salt crushing and slurring 

area. Two types of evaporation ponds are utilized: pre-concentration ponds and production ponds. Pre-

concentration ponds are located on the north-eastern section of the Playa to minimize the amount of 

Mineral Resource sterilization in the high-grade zone in the south Playa. Production ponds are located near 

the southern tip of the Playa in proximity to the Processing Plant to minimize the distance and cost related to 

hauling pond solids.  

17.3.1 Pond Evaporation Parameters 

Evaporation pond sizes and operating chemistry were developed based upon the results of a pond simulation 

model constructed using a combination of Excel spreadsheets and phase chemistry data provided by 

thermodynamics simulation software called PHREEQC™. The main input parameters of the pond model 

include the Playa brine mineral composition, the evaporation rate and leakage rates of the Playa, and the 

brine entrainment factor. 

The composition and density of the Playa brine used in the pond model provided by Norwest are presented 

in Table ‎17-3.

17.3.2 Evaporation Pond Layout 

The total pond area for this Project is 20,447 acres (82.7 km²); the evaporation pond area makes up 

approximately 19,990 acres (80.9 km²) while storage ponds make up approximately 457 acres (1.8 km²). All 

ponds are located on the Playa. There are a total of 10 pre-concentration ponds (labeled P1 to P10) and 16 

production ponds (labeled H1 to H4 A/B/C/D). Pre-concentration ponds are used to evaporate water from 

the Playa brine up to a concentration just ahead of the potassium saturation concentration. The pre-

concentrated brine is transferred to the production ponds through a brine transfer canal where further 

evaporation of water causes potassium minerals to precipitate. The placement of the pre-concentration 

ponds on the Playa is designed to minimize the amount of Mineral Resource sterilization on the Playa while 

the layout philosophy sought to minimize elevation differences in individual ponds and reduce the length of 

the brine transfer canal from P10 to the production pond. Similarly, the selection of the location of the 

production ponds is designed to reduce the amount of Mineral Resource sterilized while place those ponds in 

proximity to the Processing Plant. A rectangular 4x4 layout was chosen to facilitate pond operation and 

reduce the amount of shutdown area. The layout of the production ponds is the result of a trade-off study 

that considered berm length, harvesting methodology, operations, and pipeline lengths, among other factors. 

Pre-concentration and production pond layouts are shown in Figure ‎17-2 and Figure ‎17-3, respectively.

17.3.3 Entrainment Brine Recovery 

Brine entrainment in the pre-concentration ponds is the Project's largest source of potassium loss. This 

entrained brine can be recovered by disturbing the salt layer in which the brine is held to allow it to drain 

from the salts. Entrained brine is recovered from pre-concentration ponds P5 to P10. These ponds were 

chosen because their smaller size makes the brine recovery operation more manageable, and the brine 

entrained in these ponds has a high potassium concentration. It is assumed that approximately 40% of the 

entrained brine in these ponds can be recovered based on similar operating ponds. At least 14,300 STPH 

(12,972.8 MTPH) equivalent SOP (un-reacted) is recovered annually from this operation.

Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 246 

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

The recovery of the entrained brine takes place as follows: heel brine is pumped out of the pond being 

processed to a heel brine holding pond. The surface of the salt layer in the pre-concentration pond is 

windrowed (leaving at least 12 inches [30.5 centimeters] of salt thickness to maintain the integrity of the salt 

floor) to allow entrained brine to drain. The recovered brine is then pumped directly into harvest pond H1 via 

the brine transfer canal. The windrowed salts are pushed outside of the ponds to form a pile on the side of 

the pre-concentration ponds. The heel brine is pumped back from the holding pond to its original pre-

concentration pond. 

17.3.4 Inter-Pond Brine Transfer  

In the production ponds, brine flows from pond-to-pond in a continuous manner via manually controlled 

weirs. The weirs consist of a concrete foundation and a sectional wooden sluice gate supported by a steel 

structure, which is raised and lowered manually via a pulley system. Culverts are used to transfer brine across 

the main haul road berms. 

In the pre-concentration ponds, axial flow pumps are used to transfer brine from pond-to-pond in the larger 

P1 to P5 ponds, while weirs are used to transfer brine from P5 to P10. 

17.3.5 Potassium Salt Deposition 

Production ponds produce 3,673,239 STPY (3,332,307.3 MTPY) of salt with brine content around 15 wt%. The 

total moist salt (salts and brine) harvested from the production ponds and fed to the Processing Plant is 

approximately 4,321,458 STPY (3,920,361.9 MTPY) at an average potassium grade of 5.28 wt% K. 

17.3.6 Storage Ponds 

There are two non-evaporative ponds required in the process that are located in different areas of the Playa. 

The first non-evaporative pond is the heel brine holding pond located in the north Playa near the pre-

concentration ponds. It is used as temporary storage for the heel brine of the pre-concentration ponds being 

de-brined as part of the entrained brine recovery operation. 

The second is the process recycle brine buffer pond, located in the south Playa with the production ponds.It 

is used to accumulate process recycle brine originating from the Plant during the seven winter months. The 

Processing Plant operates on a continuous basis while evaporation ponds operate primarily during the 

evaporation season. Although evaporation ponds operate on average five months a year, the brine 

throughput is designed to supply a full year's worth of salts to the Processing Plant. Since process brine flow 

rate cannot be increased during the evaporation period, it must be stored during the winter to satisfy the 

higher throughput required during the evaporation season.  

17.3.7 Harvesting Methodology 

Harvesting operations are as described below: 

1. Ponds are drained of the liquid brine, which is moved to the next pond in the system. 

2. Remaining solids are windrowed to drain most of the remaining brine. 

3. Windrows are harvested with mobile equipment and trucked to the Processing Plant.

Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 247 

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

4. Ponds are harvested one line at a time (e.g., H1 A/B/C/D, H2 A/B/C/D, H3 A/B/C/D or H4 A/B/C/D) 

every three months allowing year-round production.  

17.3.8 Tailings Management Area  

There are two types of tailings generated in the process: solid and liquid tailings. They are each generated at 

two locations of the Project; the ponds and the Wet Plant. The pond solids generated as solid halite are laid 

down during the pre-concentration of the brine prior to the harvest ponds. They are not removed from the 

pre-concentration ponds, but instead the ponds berms are raised as required over time. This is done to 

account for the brine level rising in the ponds from the solids being laid down on the pond floor. As such, the 

tailings generated at this point of the process are not removed or stored. 

The other solid tailings generated in the process are the flotation tailings after going through the tailings 

leach process in the Wet Plant. The leached tailings are loaded on trucks and moved to the TMA as they are 

produced, and are then stockpiled throughout the life of the Project.  

The ponds system also generates a liquid tailings stream called bitterns. This represents the end brine that 

remains after evaporation has occurred and where further evaporation is not financially justifiable. The 

bittern brine is then sent to a bittern brine pond for storage. While further uses for this brine are possible, 

they are not part of this FS. 

17.4 Process General Facility Arrangement 

The Processing Plant is located to the south of the pre-concentration and production ponds. The crude salts 

from the ponds are harvested, trucked in and discharged at the northern section of the Plant marking the 

start of the process. The salts progress from east to west as they are transformed into SOP product. The Dry 

Plant is located to the south of the Wet Plant. The final product is directed to two loadout silos, where it is 

loaded into trucks for shipping to market. The product loadout is performed at the southernmost tip of the 

Processing Plant Facility. The incoming bulk MOP is unloaded at the Processing Plant on the southern section 

near the Dry Plant. The solid tailings generated are loaded onto trucks to be sent to the TMA on the western 

edge of the Wet Plant.  

The Processing Plant Facility and plant layout is shown in Figure ‎17-4.

17.5 Wet Processing Area 

The Wet Processing area receives the crude salts from the evaporation ponds and processes them into an 

SOP slurry that is directed to the Dry Plant. The unit operations are laid out from east to west with the solids 

going successively through salts crushing, conversion, flotation, mineral leach, and SOP crystallization. The 

product is directed to the Dry Plant at the south while the tailings leave the Plant on the western side. A 

maintenance area is also included in proximity to the Wet Plant.

17.5.1 Salts Crushing 

The harvest ponds are de-brined and harvesting equipment enters the pond and harvests the deposited 

minerals. Harvested salts are loaded onto trucks and transported to the Processing Plant. 

The damp mixed salts containing approximately 15 wt% moisture are discharged into an apron feeder at the 

Plant. The mixed salts are fed simultaneously with conversion brine into a cage mill to produce 50% crushed 

salt slurry. The solids content used is designed to prevent caking in the crushing unit while limiting the total 

feed to the unit. More conversion brine is then added to lower the solids content for pump ability. The 

purpose of the crushing circuit is to produce a salts feed particle size distribution for the downstream unit 

operations to operate efficiently. 

17.5.2 Conversion 

The crushed salts slurry is pumped to the conversion circuit. Conversion is operated at a constant 

temperature. The purpose of the conversion circuit is to convert the incoming pond salts into a single 

potassium-bearing mineral without removing the accompanying gangue minerals. The conversion slurry is 

pumped to the flotation circuit while a portion of the clear brine overflow from the conversion reactor is sent 

to the crushing circuit to slurry the incoming salts. 

17.5.3 Flotation 

The conversion slurry is mixed with flotation reagents in a series of two conditioning tanks where the solids 

are put in close contact with a mineral-specific flotation collector. The conditioned solids are pumped to a 

series of rougher flotation cells where potassium bearing mineral is floated from the gangue material. The 

flotation concentrate slurry is pumped to a leach reactor. The tailings are pumped to the tailings circuit. 

17.5.4 SOP Crystallization 

The potassium bearing solids are leached and then fed to the SOP crystallizer where they are mixed with 

MOP brine for the precipitation of SOP. The MOP brine is produced by dissolving purchased MOP into fresh 

water. MOP addition increases the SOP production in this equipment according to the following reaction: 

MgSO4 + 2KCl + H2O  K2SO4 + MgCl2 +H2O  

The SOP slurry is pumped to a hydrocyclone followed by a centrifuge to separate the mother liquor from the 

solid SOP while clear crystallizer overflow is pumped to the leach reactor. Mother liquor separated from the 

SOP slurry is recycled to the reactor while SOP solids are dried and screened to generate Standard SOP 

product. SOP produced in this step can also be further processed in the Dry Plant to generate other SOP 

products.  

17.5.5 MOP Dissolution 

MOP brine sent to the SOP crystallizer system is generated by dissolving MOP purchased from external 

producers. The MOP is trucked in to the Plant where it is directed to bulk handling equipment and metered 

into an agitated tank for dissolution. Since the MOP purchased may contain oil and insolvable materials, a

coalescing filter is used to remove impurities from the brine. The brine is then pumped directly to the SOP 

crystallization system.  

17.6 Dry Processing Area 

The Dry Plant process commences with the SOP de-brining operation and is summarized below. 

Solids are withdrawn from the bottom of the crystallizer as slurry and are pumped to an agitated tank where 

a small amount of process water is added to dissolve any remaining unreacted intermediate potassium-

bearing mineral. The slurry from this tank is pumped to the SOP hydrocyclone to pre-thicken the feed prior to 

a pusher-type centrifuge. The overhead stream from this hydrocyclone is directed to the SOP mother liquor 

tank, which also receives the centrate from the SOP centrifuge. A small quantity of water is used as a last 

stage wash on the cake in the pusher centrifuge in order to displace any remaining mother liquor.  

The washed SOP cake is subsequently transferred to the SOP fluid bed dryer. The centrate produced in the 

pusher centrifuge is combined in a tank with the SOP hydrocyclone overhead stream. They are then pumped 

back to the SOP crystallizer through the dedicated recirculation leg. 

The Dry Plant is designed to operate in two separate campaign modes as detailed in Table ‎17-4. 

Table ‎17-4: Processing Facility Production  

Description 

Producing 100% Standard product only 

Producing 90% Granular and 10% Water-Soluble products simultaneously with no Standard product produced 

 

The solid cake from the centrifuges is first dried in a fluid bed dryer that uses propane as the energy source. 

The fluid bed dryer is designed to heat the product and generate a virtually moisture-free (0.2 wt% moisture 

content) material at its outlet. 

Dried solids are discharged from the fluid bed dryer onto the dry SOP drag conveyor, which then transfers the 

feed to a screen via a bucket elevator to produce the most suitable granulometric mixture that satisfies the 

desired product throughput and particle size distribution being generated during a given production 

campaign.

The oversize material is directed to a single stage cage mill for size reduction while the undersize material is 

combined with the on-size stream. 

When producing Standard product only, the crushed material exiting the above-mentioned cage mill is 

recycled to the top of the dried product screen by a series of diverters before being merged with the on-size 

and undersize streams. The on-size material is conveyed to the silos of the loadout area by the product belt 

conveyor. 

When producing Granular and Water-Soluble product, the on-size stream is partly diverted by a series of 

diverters and belt conveyors in order to allow the larger particles to pass through the oversize material cage 

mill, thus, allowing the required quantity of the Water-Soluble SOP grade to be produced. The material 

exiting the cage mill is sent to the bagging plant where it is packaged in large one-ton bags using a bagging 

system. The remaining on-size and undersize streams are merged and transferred to the compaction circuit. 

The crushed material is sent to a series of screens. The oversize material is processed through a cage mill for 

size reduction and then re-circulated back to the compactor in the undersize material stream from the 

screens. The on-size material is then conveyed to the glazing circuit. 

The glazing circuit consists of a glazing drum followed by a propane-heated fluid bed dryer/cooler. Process 

water is sprayed on the tumbling granules to produce a uniform coating that hardens in the fluid bed. The 

product is heated in the glazing unit and then dried and cooled before it undergoes a final screening. The on-

size material is conveyed to the silos of the loadout area by the product belt conveyor.

17.6.1 Product Loadout 

The Standard and Granular on-size material from the drying/compaction area is sent to either of the 

dedicated silos. A common belt conveyor is used for that purpose since these products are not produced 

simultaneously. This conveyor also features a weighing system to measure the production output. Prior to 

being transferred to the silos via a series of a bucket elevator and a conveyor, the silos feed stream features a 

sampling station from which a sample of product can be withdrawn for laboratory analysis. 

From the silos, the product is loaded into trucks via a multiple-spout system, each fitted with a retractable 

chute to ensure dust-tight material transfer into the transport trailers. Each silo operates independently and 

loads one trailer at a time. De-dusting oil is added on a weight basis to the material in the chute leading to 

the transport trailer. 

Figure ‎17-6: Product Loadout Model

17.6.2 Product Transport 

All product grades are transported by a fleet of trucks from the Processing Plant Facility to the Rail Loadout 

Facility located approximately 13 miles (20.9 kilometers) away, where they are stored prior to being loaded 

into railcars. 

17.6.3 Reagent Storage and Preparation 

The reagents storage area is located in the Wet Plant. The flotation reagents (collector, frother, and 

extender) are stored near the flotation cells where they are required. Three flotation reagents are used in the 

flotation process. Anti-dusting oil is added to the product at loadout to prevent dust formation during 

transport and handling. The injection points are the truck loadout station and the inlet of the emergency 

storage dome. The dosage of oil is 0.1 wt% oil for all SOP products. The anti-dusting oil is stored locally near 

the loadout silos and pumped on the product as needed.

ITEM 18: PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

18.1 Main Access Road 

Access to the Processing Plant is via the existing Crystal Peak Road. This road begins at Highway 257 and 

heads to the Processing Plant. The Rail Loadout Facility and Highway 257 are 13 and 15 miles (20.9 and 24.1 

kilometers) respectively from the Processing Plant. The Crystal Peak Road is a 40-foot (12.2-meter) wide 

gravel road with a speed limit of 30 mph (48 km/h). 

The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT), Highway Patrol and other regulatory bodies' road 

regulations has been investigated. As far as it is known, Crystal Peak Road is a county road and bears no 

special load or length restrictions. No upgrades to the road are necessary for the Project. 

Access to the main Processing Plant Facility is restricted by perimeter fencing, where pre-established 

checkpoints with guard houses are provided. 

The locations of the Processing Plant, Rail Loadout Facility, and Highway 257 are illustrated in Figure ‎18-1. 

Figure ‎18-1: Crystal Peak Road

18.2 Ponds Area Access Roads 

Existing roads are located around the perimeter of the Playa, extending from Steamboat Pass Road, Headlight 

Canyon Road, Highway 6/50, and the SR 257 cutoff road to reach the Playa. These existing Playa access roads 

(Segments A, B, C1, C2, D, E, and F) are shown on Figure ‎18-2. Perimeter road Segments 1 through 11 and 

associated turnouts, all located outside the lease boundary, will connect to perimeter road Spurs 1 through 4, 

which are located inside the mineral lease boundary. 

The existing road network provides access to portions of Sevier Playa via state and local roads, including 

Highway 6/50, SR 257, Crystal Peak Road, Steamboat Pass Road, Headlight Canyon Road, and SR 257 Cutoff

Road, as well as other existing roads. In addition to the existing and planned roads that are discussed under 

previous sections and associated with specific Project components, the Project will use six existing Playa 

access roads located outside of the lease boundary (Segments A, B, C1, C2, D, E, and F). Road Segments A, B, 

C1, C2, D, E, and F will be improved and maintained as necessary to provide access to the Sevier Playa during 

Project construction and operation phases.  

A perimeter road will be constructed on the Playa using materials adjacent to the road location. The majority 

of perimeter road will be located on land that is currently under lease from the BLM or SITLA. 

The road network for the pre-concentration ponds consists of roads that will be constructed on the berms. 

These roads will be constructed using materials from the Playa adjacent to the pond area and will range in 

width and height as the pre-concentration ponds are built over time. 

The road network for the production ponds consist of roads constructed on the berm areas around the 

ponds. These roads will be constructed using materials from the Playa adjacent to the pond area. 

A road will be constructed from the Processing Plant Facility to the TMA. This road will be constructed to 

support heavy equipment traffic that is associated with the TMA and will be constructed of materials 

adjacent to the road alignment.

18.3 Processing Plant 

The Processing Plant is located in the south side of the Sevier Playa in order to take advantage of the 

vicinity to the harvest ponds, having a relatively level surface (to minimize earthworks), and having an 

adequate bearing capacity to allow for conventional foundations. 

The layout generated for the Processing Plant provides for safe and direct access for both the crude salt 

harvesting vehicles and the SOP product transport trucks to their discharge points, with dedicated 

return road loops included. 

There are two main gates in the Processing Plant, one in the west side to access the Water Wells and the 

Rail Loadout Facility. The other gate is located in the north and is used to access the ponds.

The sequential layout of the unit operations for the Processing Plant successfully minimized the overall 

footprint of the area and allowed for minimal piping and cable runs between the areas. 

A main pipe rack enters the Processing Plant from the north and connects the ponds area to the Wet Plant.  

The fresh water pipeline enters the Processing Plant from the west side and discharges into the process 

water tank.

18.4 Rail Loadout Facility 

The Rail Loadout Facility contains dedicated areas for receiving truckloads of SOP from the Processing Plant, 

storage of product, and screening and loading of SOP into railcars. In addition, provisions have been made for 

unloading of railcars containing MOP. Product from the Processing Plant is transported by haul truck via the 

existing Crystal Peak Road to the Rail Loadout Facility. 

Material delivered by truck is elevated using conveyors at a maximum rate of 240 STPH (217.7 MTPH) and 

then directed to one of the storage domes or to screening through a two-deck screen. Screened material is 

then diverted to a product bin for railcar loading. Oversized material is directed to a roll crusher and returned 

to the screen feed. Undersized material is directed to a reject bin for addition to Standard SOP or returned to 

the Processing Plant for re-processing.  

Material from the storage domes is reclaimed using belt feeders that direct the material to the screen feed. 

Material in the product bin is directed to railcar loading. Loading is intermittent due to the need to move the 

railcars and the loading conveyor. The constraints on loading rate is the feed to the screen, the time required 

to load a railcar, and the time required to move single cars and batches of cars. Railcars are located on a track 

scale during loading. SOP is fed to the railcar using a product bin discharge conveyor and a shuttle conveyor. 

Operation of the conveyors is controlled by the weight of SOP deposited in each railcar as measured using a 

rail scale located beneath the loading zone. The shuttle conveyor evenly distributes the product in each 

railcar.  

The rail yard consists of seven yard-tracks used for receiving unit trains, or smaller, of empty railcars, loading 

material into the railcars, and assembling trains of loaded railcars ready for departure. A new rail spur line 

will be constructed to connect the Rail Loadout Facility to the existing UPRR main-line approximately 3 miles 

(4.8 kilometers) east of the site.

18.5 Civil and Earthworks 

18.5.1 Aggregate 

Aggregate is acquired from different quarries located in proximity to the Processing Plant. 

Different types of aggregate material are obtained from these potential quarries. The main type of aggregate 

needed for the Project is a fill material composed of mixed aggregate that can be used directly without any 

crushing and/or screening. 

The other aggregate materials required are: 

 Screened aggregates for sub-base and base coarse to be used for the road construction. 

 Screened aggregates for backfilling of the underground services trenches, as well as around the 

buildings' foundations and under the floor slabs. 

 Boulders material required as riprap for erosion protection on the ditches' side slope and dykes. 

 Sand to be used as bedding in the trenches of the underground services. 

18.5.2 Site Preparation 

The Processing Plant site is cleared and grubbed for site development. The site is rough graded and leveled, 

and is designed to balance the cut and fill volumes, and also by forming sloping levels and plateaus to ensure 

positive surface drainage to storm ditches. The levels of the rough grading consider the future buildings' floor 

elevations and the rapport between buildings and the final finish grade of the Processing Plant. If any surplus 

excavated material is suitable for re-use, it will be preserved in on-site stockpiles for later use as fill during 

the finish grading operation. 

In all areas, the finish grade elevations for roads and yard are below the floor elevation of the building by a 

minimum of 6 inches (15.2 centimeters) with local ramps provided at doorways as required. Yard grading has 

a finished grade slope of 2% away from structures for a minimum of 15 feet (4.6 meters). 

18.5.3 Site Roads, Parking and Walkways 

The Project site road layout is designed to accommodate general site traffic for the operation and 

maintenance of the different Project Facilities. Road layout design considers anticipated vehicle and 

equipment turning geometrics and clearances while maintaining safe traffic flow and access. Plant site roads 

are divided into three types. 

Plant site roads are classified as private roads and therefore do not meet to meet all of the same design 

requirements of public roads. The designs for the site access and service roads, as well as parking lots, are in 

accordance with all codes applicable and in force at the time of execution of the work. All roads and parking 

lots, as well as culverts and piping in the different areas of the Processing Plant, are designed for the load of 

the heaviest truck axle operating on the site during construction and operation, except for those areas of 

special equipment operation, which consider actual vehicle loading. Road width and grading is determined 

based on access requirements for vehicles, firefighting, and maintenance purposes.

18.5.4 Underground Services 

18.5.4.1 Fire Protection Water Loop 

The underground fire protection system has numerous fire hydrants spaced at a maximum distance of 250 

feet (76.2 meters) apart to ensure adequate coverage. 

The material for the underground fire line is a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pressured line approved for 

fire protection systems.  

18.5.4.2 Storm Sewer System 

The climatic conditions for the Processing Plant are mountainous with an average of 8.03 inches (204 

millimeters) of annual precipitation (Gwynn, 2006). The precipitation on the Processing Plant site is being 

handled in the following manner: 

 Diversion away from the Plant site prior to contact with the Processing Plant Facilities by means of an 

open ditch at the perimeter of the site, as well as a constructed perimeter dyke for flood control. 

 Within the Plant site, by means of an open ditch system to convey the run-off to the stormwater 

collecting pond located at northwest of the Processing Plant. 

18.5.4.3 Sanitary Sewer System 

In the Processing Plant, domestic water and sanitary sewage are collected from different buildings that have 

sanitary facilities, such as washrooms, showers, kitchen, and cafeteria. This collection is done via an 

underground sanitary sewer line that is then conveyed to a packaged wastewater treatment plant.  

Plant sanitary sewage system consists of an activated sludge-type packaged plant. The resulting effluent from 

this unit meets the discharge requirements to the environment and provides non-potable reusable discharge. 

For remote buildings that have sanitary facilities and are far from the underground sanitary sewer system, or 

where such a system does not exist, their sanitary line is discharged into a septic tank made of a cast-in-place 

or precast concrete unit that is emptied on a regular basis by the Processing Plant maintenance crew, or by a 

third-party contractor. 

18.6 Utilities 

18.6.1 Fresh Water Source 

The fresh water needs for processing and administration Facilities for the proposed Project site are 922 gpm 

(209.4 m
3
/h). CPM has secured these water rights from the state of Utah. Fresh water supports plant 

production operations, fire protection water, domestic uses, and general use at the Processing Plant and Rail 

Loadout Facilities. Groundwater was evaluated to serve these needs at the proposed Plant. Aquifer tests on 

two monitoring wells and one test borehole were conducted to collect preliminary well production and water 

quality data. The test borehole air-lift testing and analytical water quality results indicated that abundant, 

high-quality groundwater is present in the PMQ that will serve the proposed Plant's fresh water needs. Four 

Fresh Water Production Wells, each capable of producing up to 300 gpm (68.4 m
3
/h), are to be drilled to 

approximately 1,500 feet (457.2 meters) bgs.  



NI 43-101 Technical Report Summarizing the Feasibility Study for the Sevier Playa Potash Project, Millard County, Utah 
Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 260 

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

Each of the four Fresh Water Production Wells discharge through a vault to a combined fresh water pipeline. 

The combined pipeline is routed to a storage tank at the Processing Plant for process, domestic, and utility 

usages.  

Water from the Processing Plant is transported by tanker trucks approximately 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) to a 

storage tank at the Rail Loadout Facility. Individual pumps draw from the storage tank to serve the fire water 

loop or the Rail Loadout Facility utility loop for non-potable needs. Bottled water is supplied for consumption 

and other potable water needs. 

18.6.2 Process Water 

The water from the Fresh Water Wells is transferred directly to the process water tank that stores water for 

all the consumers of the Plant, with a dedicated reserved quantity for fire protection water. The process 

water tank has a total capacity of 634,000 gallons (2,400 m
3
); with 330,000 gallons (1,249.9 m

3
) dedicated to 

fire protection water. The process water tank has four hours reserve for the process users, consisting of: 

 Flotation  

 Conversion 

 Crystallization 

 Chillers 

 Sealing systems 

 Potable water treatment system  

 Water flushing networks 

 Utility stations throughout the Plant (e.g., wash bay stations, etc.) 

18.6.3 Potable Water 

The preliminary fresh water analysis indicates that the fresh water is not suitable for human consumption 

without treatment. 

In order to produce the potable water required for the operations, the fresh water is taken directly from the 

process water tank and passed through the green sand potable water treatment plant prior to being stored in 

the holding tank, where the potable water is disinfected with sodium hypochlorite. 

The distribution pump transfers potable water to all users within the Processing Plant.  

Safety showers and eyewash stations are connected to the potable water distribution system. 

18.6.4 Liquefied Petroleum Gas 

Propane is delivered in its liquefied form via highway trucks or "bobtail" trucks. 

The storage tank has the capacity of 30,000 gallons (113.6 m
3
), made of single wall mild steel with a design 

built to ASME standards to provide increased safety in handling the fuel. 

Liquid propane gas is used in the Processing Plant to fuel the burners of the drying equipment: a main fluid 

bed dryer and a glazing fluid bed dryer/cooler.

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

The propane storage is sufficient for a full week of operations (7 days/24 hours). 

18.6.5 Diesel Fuel 

Diesel is delivered via highway trucks or "bobtail" trucks. 

Diesel fuel is used for all mobile equipment including the vehicles and the mobile pumps in the ponds area. 

Ultra-low sulfur diesel is used to comply with Tier IV Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission 

regulations. 

The storage tank, with a capacity of 25,000 gallons (94.6 m
3
), is made of mild steel with a double walled 

design built to UL-142 and UL-2085 standard to provide increased safety in handling the diesel fuel. 

The distribution system is composed of piping to the diesel generators, as well as piping and a fuel dispenser 

for the mobile equipment refueling. 

18.6.6 Fire Protection 

The fire protection systems are designed based on National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards to 

provide appropriate life safety and property loss protection. The fire protection systems are based on the 

assumption that the process building structures are non-combustible. 

The preliminary fire hazard analysis indicated that the worst-case event would be related to a fire at any of 

the diesel fuel tanks. 

The overall fire protection network at the Processing Plant consists of a main fire water loop, which is 

composed of fire hydrants, distribution piping, and sprinkler systems in the inhabited areas.  

All enclosed areas are provided with full coverage from fire hose cabinets and are supplemented with 

portable hand-held fire extinguishers. 

All inhabited buildings are protected by a sprinkler system, including: 

 Administration/operations support buildings 

 Control rooms 

 Maintenance shops and warehouses 

 Vehicle repair buildings 

In electrical rooms, water is not used for fire protection since inert gas systems are provided for all switch 

gear and main electrical cabinets. 

A fire truck is located in the fire fighter garage and is kept ready for intervention. The fire truck features 

water reserve and pumps and has a foam system mixing/injection capability. 

18.6.7 Fire Protection Water 

The process water tank has 330,000 gallons (1,249.9 m
3
) of water reserved for fire protection water. No 

water treatment is planned for the fire protection water since the quality of the fresh water is acceptable.

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

The fire water pump station is positioned in the vicinity of the process water tank, connecting directly to the 

tank and supplying fire protection water to the entire fire protection water loop for the Processing Plant. 

The fire protection water loop is designed according to NFPA 24 and is composed of the HDPE underground 

piping system, hydrants, shut-off and isolation valves, and the water sprinkler systems for the buildings. 

18.6.8 Compressed Air 

The compressed air system is located in the vicinity of the Dry Plant in a dedicated building and is composed 

of the following main component: 

 Air compressors  

 Refrigerant dryer 

 Air receiver 

 Desiccant dryer 

 Micro filter, pre-filter, and post-filter 

The compressed air quality supplied by a compressed air package complies with the requirements of ISO 

8573.1 or ANSI/ISA-7.0.01 standard for plant air and instrument air. 

18.6.9 Pipelines 

The Project includes several pipeline systems to transport the brines and utilities.  

The main pipelines systems in the Project are: 

 Extraction Wells Branches and Headers: Extraction wells equipped with pumps will be used to 

extract brine from the lower portions of the MCZ and the SCZ. These wells will be equipped with 

piping that will drain extracted brine into the nearest extraction trench. Wells located north of the 

pre-concentration ponds will be connected via a manifold piping system that will be discharged into 

the extraction canal. Other wells that are some distance from the extraction trench will also be 

connected to a manifold system that is piped to the nearest extraction trench.  

 Pre-Concentrated Brine Pipeline: a pipeline transfers the brine from the termination of the north-to-

south pre-concentrated brine canal to the brine mixing pit ahead of the process recycle brine buffer 

pond. 

 Playa Brine: the Playa brine pipeline transfers the Playa brines from the extraction trench system to 

the tailings leach area in the Processing Plant. The length of the pipeline is 6,500 feet (1,982 meters). 

 Bittern Brine: the bittern brine pipeline transfers the bittern brines from the bittern brine canal in 

the production ponds area to the TMA. The length of the pipeline is 19,800 feet (6,035 meters). 

 Recycle Brine: the recycle brine pipeline transfers the recycle brines from the tailings separation area 

in the Processing Plant to the process recycle brine buffer pond in the production ponds area. The 

length of the pipeline is 3,008 feet (917 meters).

18.7 Electrical Supply and Power Distribution 

18.7.1 High Voltage Electrical Power Supply Line 

The Project's electrical power is supplied at 69 kV by Rocky Mountain Power (a PacifiCorp Company) from the 

Black Rock substation, which is located approximately 46 miles (74 kilometers) to the northeast of the 

Processing Plant. A minimum 18 MW capacity 69 kV overhead transmission line is designed and built by the 

Project and feeds the main substation located at the Processing Plant and the future substation located in the 

north Playa, representing a total utility demand load 14.8 MW. 

The power line is routed along the existing north-south road on the east side of the Playa and terminates at 

the Processing Plant. 

18.7.2 Electrical Substations 

One outdoor air-insulated main substation is provided for the Processing Plant's power distribution 

requirements.  

This substation transforms the 69-kV high voltage power supply to the 12.47 kV distribution level, which is 

then routed via overhead pole lines to the Processing Plant's electrical rooms as well as to the Rail Loadout 

Facilities, Water Wells, and brine transfer pumps located in the south part of the Playa.  

Prefabricated modular electrical rooms are provided at the center of concentration of the electrical loads, 

with the low voltage power distributed from these electrical rooms to the loads. 

18.7.3 Plant Power Distribution 

The Processing Plant features five modular electrical rooms located in the following areas: Wet Plant, Dry 

Plant, salt crushing, MOP handling, and loadout. 

These prefabricated modular electrical rooms house the medium voltage and low voltage switchgear and 

Motor Control Centers (MCCs) in the Wet and Dry Plant electrical rooms while the salt crushing, MOP 

handling and loadout have low voltage MCCs only.  

18.7.4 Playa Electrical Supply 

The initial operation of the pumps in the north Playa and the south Playa will be initially powered by gen-sets. 

The north Playa loads will then be powered by an overhead 25-kV distribution pole line to feed the pumps 

located near the canals and ponds in the north part of the Sevier lakebed. The Playa substation transforms 

the utility HV supply from 69 kV to a distribution voltage of 25 kV. 

After the initial operation using diesel gen-sets, the south Playa loads consisting of the recharge canal lift 

stations 120-PP-101A, 101B, 102A (30 HP [22 kW] each) and the transfer canal lift pumps 260-PP-201B, 201C, 

201D, 201E (20 HP [15 kW] each) located on the east-central side of the Sevier lakebed will be powered 

individually by solar panels and inverters. 

As described elsewhere in this Technical Report, Playa extraction wells will be solar powered.

February 21, 2018  Page 264 

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

The Processing Plant substation will feed the pumps located at the production ponds via a 12.47 kV overhead 

pole line. 

The area and roadway designs provide for safe lighting levels using LED luminaires that are photo-electrically 

controlled, and have the advantage of low energy consumption, long life and minimal required maintenance. 

Where area or road lighting is required in remote areas, LED luminaires powered by solar panels and 

batteries are provided. 

18.7.5 Area and Road Lighting 

Diesel generator sets supply the electrical power required during the initial brine fill period of the 

evaporation ponds. This filling occurs during the Plant construction period and includes all the brine transfer 

pumps in the pre-concentration ponds, the lift stations along the canals to the east of the evaporation ponds, 

and the transfer pumps within the production ponds. 

After the main Processing Plant substation is put into operation, the brine transfer pumps in the production 

ponds are transferred from the gen-sets to the main Plant substation's 12.47 kV distribution network.  

The Playa substation and electrical power distribution to the brine transfer pumps in the pre-concentration 

ponds construction commences after the Processing Plant startup, and are included in Deferred Capital. After 

the construction of the Playa substation and distribution network is complete, the pumps in the pre-

concentration ponds are transferred from the gen-sets to the Playa substation and the associated 25 kV 

distribution network.  

At the same time, the lift station pumps located in the transfer canal (on the side of the Playa) that are also 

operating on gen-sets, are transferred to solar panels and batteries with the associated Capital Cost included 

in the Deferred Capital Cost. 

18.7.6 Grounding Protection 

The two substations each have a grounding grid covering their perimeter in order to maintain a safe step and 

touch potential rise while providing a ground return path for fault currents back to the source. 

Buildings in the Processing Plant are encircled by a ground conductor loop with ground rods that are 

interconnected to cover the whole Plant area. All cables and cable trays have a bonding conductor so as to 

provide a return path for fault currents to the source. In addition, the ground grid provides for dissipation of 

energy due to lightning strikes. 

18.7.7 Emergency Power 

The emergency power supply sources are two containerized 12.47 kV 1500 kVA diesel generators located in 

proximity to the Plant substation. In the event of a utility power failure, an automatic transfer scheme 

provides the emergency electrical power supply. The switchgears and starters are intelligent and direct 

electrical power to priority loads.

ITEM 19: MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

19.1 Market Studies and Contracts 

The information in this section is compiled from public reports, forecasts, studies and estimates, as well as 

from commissioned market assessments prepared by Parthenon and CRU. The Parthenon research study, 

titled "SOP Market Assessment" (Parthenon Group, 2013) and the CRU research study, titled "SOP Market 

Study" (CRU Consulting, 2017) together serve as the primary research reports. Both reports focus on market 

analysis, supply and demand expectations, pricing trends, and economic forecasting and modeling. These two 

studies, along with the other research reports, inform the marketing plan developed by CPM for domestic 

and international distribution of potassium sulfate and magnesium-based associated products.  

19.2 Potassium Sulfate - Production Capacity 

Global potassium sulfate production capacity was estimated by CRU at 10.5 million short tons 

(9.5 million metric tonnes) in 2015 (CRU Consulting, 2017). Two regions, China and Europe, accounted for 

59% and 22% of capacity respectively, with the balance of world capacity being fragmented and distributed 

over more than a dozen other countries. Outside of China, most countries have only one domestic potassium 

sulfate producer or none at all. In the United States, excluding CPM's Sevier Playa Project, there is only one 

additional potassium sulfate greenfield project under evaluation. 

19.3 Product Grades 

Standard grade SOP accounts for the largest share of the global SOP market where it is commonly used in the 

production of multi-nutrient fertilizers. In the United States, however, most growers use Granular grade 

which can be incorporated into nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) blends which are a strong feature 

of this market. Water-Soluble forms of SOP are also used in areas with limited rainfall. Granular grades are 

also commonly used on sandy soils, whereas Water-Soluble fertilizers work well on heavier soils and are 

typically used in dry areas where drip fertigation systems are already in-place. 

19.4 Potassium Sulfate Market Overview – The Americas 

Historically, North America has been the world's third largest SOP market after China and Europe. SOP 

consumption patterns in the United States are well established, with demand significantly concentrated in 

two states: California and Florida, where a large proportion of the country's fruit, vegetable and nut crops are 

cultivated. 

CRU projects that North America's demand for potassium sulfate will increase at a rate of 4.8% per year from 

2016 to 2020 (CRU Consulting, 2017). Overall, SOP demand in North America accounted for 5.4% of global 

SOP demand in 2016 (CRU Consulting, 2017).  

SOP consumption in Central and South America increased by 69,446 short tons (63,000 metric tonnes) from 

2010 to 2016. Based on increases in chloride-intolerant crops and slightly higher adoption rates in favor of 

SOP, the demand in this region is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 2.7% from an estimated 

314,159 short tons (285,000 metric tonnes) in 2016.

19.5 Potassium Sulfate Market Overview - International  

World SOP demand has grown at a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1% since 2010 to reach 

6.72 million short tons (6.1 million metric tonnes) in 2016. China has been the major driver of this rapid 

growth and now accounts for more than half of global SOP consumption. However, Africa's SOP demand 

overtook that of North America in 2016. 

The international market represents a significant opportunity for both existing and greenfield potassium 

sulfate producers. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (UN FAO) estimates that there are 

509 million acres (206 million hectares) of chloride-sensitive crops, the significant majority of which are 

located in Asia (Parthenon Group, 2013). India has the world's largest area of chloride-sensitive crops under 

cultivation. Second only to India, China grows a significant amount of chloride-sensitive crops, and is the 

world's largest consumer of potassium sulfate. Brazil and several Southeast Asian countries also represent 

significant opportunities based on their chloride-sensitive crop production. 

Brazil is third largest consumer of potassium chloride in the world, although SOP represents less than 1% of 

its overall potassium fertilizer consumption. According to CRU, Brazil applies less than 1% of its K2O fertilizer 

in the form of potassium sulphate. However, with approximately 24 million acres (9.7 million hectares) of 

chloride-sensitive crops under cultivation, approximately 10% of its total cultivated land, Brazil represents a 

significant market opportunity for potassium sulfate consumption (Parthenon Group, 2013). 

Global potassium sulfate demand in 2012 was estimated at 4.9 million short tons (4.4 million metric tonnes). 

At the time, China represented approximately 45% of demand, followed by Europe and the United States. 

Demand is projected to increase across all regions, reaching worldwide demand of approximately 7.8 million 

short tons (7 million metric tonnes) by 2020 (CRU Consulting, 2017). 

19.6 Market Opportunities 

SOP is consumed in relatively small volumes across many disparate markets, often with a seasonal aspect to 

shipments. Based upon information contained in the market studies, CPM's initial strategy is to place the 

maximum amount of SOP into California and the Pacific Northwest. Market analysis indicates that the largest 

opportunity for domestic market penetration exists in these regions. CRU assesses that within the United 

States, there exists a relatively high concentration of SOP demand in two states: California and Florida. 

The abundance of demand in these two states makes them natural markets of interest to any potential 

SOP producer. However, there also exists sizable demand for SOP in states such as Washington and 

Oregon where cultivation of fruit and vegetables is a significant driver of local SOP demand. 

According to Parthenon, there are approximately 776,026 short tons (704,000 metric tonnes) of domestic 

consumption opportunity, with California being both the largest domestic consumer of SOP and having the 

largest opportunity for market growth. Domestic SOP usage for crops is estimated at 295,419 short tons 

(268,000 metric tonnes), while total SOP usage was listed at 384,068 STPY (348,421 MTPY) (Parthenon Group, 

2013).  

Parthenon indicates that approximately 1.07 million short tons (972,000 metric tonnes) of additional 

opportunity exist at full penetration into domestic SOP markets (Parthenon Group, 2013).  

Once the domestic market has been fully explored, CPM intends to expand into Mexico, Central America and 

South America. The combined Central and South American region is the second largest import market in the

world and is home to established consumers in Mexico, Peru and Brazil, as well as a growing consumer base 

in Colombia and Ecuador. CPM is strategically located to compete in these areas. 

19.7 Pricing 

There is no benchmark pricing for potassium sulfate since it is a specialty fertilizer produced in small volumes 

relative to MOP. Due to the relative scarcity of primary producers, and to Mannheim production that 

requires MOP as an input, SOP exhibits a recent historical premium of 50% or more over MOP.  

According to Parthenon's analysis, many suppliers and retailers view the Unites States' market as being in 

equilibrium at the current SOP price, though supply-demand dynamics and/or other factors can affect price 

(Parthenon Group, 2013). CRU assesses that it is unlikely to see tonnages in the millions-range of new 

primary SOP capacity being built, and anticipates that an operation with production capacity in the 

330,693 STPY (300,000 MTPY) range should be able to place product into the market with a well-executed 

market strategy while maintaining an international price premium (CRU Consulting, 2017). 

According to Company research, three primary factors influence the price premium of potassium sulfate over 

potassium chloride. They are, in order of importance: 

1. The marginal cost of production (secondary production) required to satisfy global SOP demand. 

2. The nature of the market for high-value crops to which potassium sulfate is typically applied. 

3. Sulfur prices. 

CPM plans to sell the majority of its product into United States' markets. Accordingly, the following are 

sources that have been consulted for pricing data as of the time of publication of this Technical Report: 

 United States SOP-only sales price of $572 USD/st ($631 USD/mt), from the SOP market study 

prepared by CRU (CRU Consulting, 2017). 

 Average United States market SOP price range of $575 to $582 USD/st ($633 to $641 USD/mt), 

quoted by Green Markets as of December 15, 2017 (Kennedy Information, LLC, 2017). 

 Average selling price over the past five quarters of $578 USD/st ($637 USD/mt), based on prices 

published by Compass Minerals. 

For the purposes of financial modeling, CPM has used a starting price for SOP of $571 USD/st ($630 USD/mt), 

based on the above referenced data. This price is inflated within the Economic Model on the same basis as all 

other financial data during the period of operations. 

CPM is currently pursuing off-take agreements with various partners for Standard product. It is likely that 

early off-take agreements will incur some level of discounting; thus, the quantity of supply offered in the 

early off-take agreements will be limited. Concurrent with the pursuit of these agreements, CPM is 

investigating opportunities to establish long-term arrangements for Water-Soluble and Granular product in 

those markets where the greatest net-back potential exists. Once initial off-take objectives are accomplished, 

CPM will explore additional opportunities in other markets, including the possibility of branding, selling via 

smaller packages, and pursuing maximum sales of Water-Soluble grade.

19.8 Logistics 

SOP product is transported from the Processing Plant by top-load, bottom-dump tandem haul truck. The 

trucks travel along Crystal Peak Road from the Plant loadout to the Rail Loadout Facility located 

approximately 13 miles (20.9 kilometers) away, as shown in Figure ‎19-1. Each truck is equipped with two 

trailers and is capable of transporting approximately 51 short tons (46.3 metric tonnes) of product per trip 

(two x 25.5 short tons [23.1 metric tonnes]). Four tandem trucks with a total of eight trailers are required for 

hauling the product to the Rail Loadout Facility. A total of twenty trips are made (five/truck) on a daily basis. 

When travelling back to the Plant, the product transfer trucks are loaded with MOP that is stored at the Rail 

Loadout Facility for transfer to the Plant. 

Figure ‎19-1: Plant and Rail Loadout Locations 

 
Source: CPM 
 

19.9 Product Transport to Market 

SOP is transported in rail cars with a capacity of 100 short tons (90.7 metric tonnes), from the Rail Loadout 

Facility to market. 

In the case of product destined for the North American market, SOP is transported directly to a fertilizer 

blender's location. Due to the requirement for prompt product availability during the fertilizer season, and 

the fact that many fertilizer blenders and distributors are no longer served by rail, the SOP needs to be 

transported to in-market storage locations by rail and then reshipped by truck to individual customers as 

needed. These regional storage facilities are leased by CPM on a seasonal, annual or longer-term basis. 

When CPM looks to begin shipping to international markets, SOP is shipped by rail to a terminal at a Gulf 

Coast or Pacific port where it is loaded onto vessels for transport overseas. At the port, the SOP may be 

loaded directly from rail cars to ships or placed in storage for loading at a later time. The exception to 

shipment from port for international sales is for product transported to Mexico and/or Canada. In this case, 

the SOP is transported by rail or by truck directly from the Rail Loadout Facility to customers in these 

respective countries.

20.2.1 Exploration Permits 

Mineral exploration activities require an approval from DOGM. Exploration activities within the lease area are 

being completed under exploration permits E/027/0078, E/027/0080 and E/027/0084. In addition, 

exploration activities of minerals on federal land require approval from the BLM. Exploration activities on 

federal leases are done through compliance with the Sevier Dry Lake Exploratory Testing EA October 2011 

(Bureau of Land Management, 2011).  

20.2.2 NEPA Analysis 

The majority of the environmental baseline surveys are now completed and the results are being analyzed by 

the BLM for inclusion into the appropriate environment section of the EIS as well as to evaluate potential 

impacts from the Project to those environmental resources.  

Scoping meetings were held in August 2015 to obtain public input on the NEPA process. At these scoping 

meetings, the Proposed Action (Mining Plan and Plan of Development) was presented and the public was 

invited to comment on the scope of the Proposed Action Plan. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement 

(DEIS) is currently being prepared and it will be released for public review following an announcement of its 

availability. Public meetings will be held following release of the DEIS to facilitate public response. The public 

comments and BLM responses will then be summarized into a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). 

The EIS process ends with the issuance of the Record of Decision (ROD). 

20.2.3 Mining Plan Approval 

A draft Mining Plan has been submitted to the BLM and is currently being reviewed. Once the BLM is satisfied 

with the Mining Plan, it will be submitted to DOGM for their review and comments. The Mining Plan can be 

approved once the necessary reviews have been completed, the reclamation bond posted, and once the 

ROD, as part of the NEPA analysis, has been signed.  

20.2.4 Rights of Ways 

CPM submitted an Application for Transportation and Utility Systems and Facilities on Federal Lands 

(Standard Form 299) to the BLM for a ROW grant on land administered by the BLM for construction, 

operation, and maintenance for the off-lease facilities of the Project. The BLM is considering the application 

in accordance with the respective act(s) in order to grant ROWs, as well as the terms and conditions. The Plan 

of Development has also been submitted to the BLM for their review and consideration.  

20.2.5 Water Appropriations 

Six water rights applications were submitted for the Project and were approved by the State Engineer's office 

on April 30, 2014.  

Water to support the processing of minerals crystallized from brine would be sourced from groundwater. The 

operation would require approximately 922 gpm (209.4 m
3
/h) of fresh water for processing and other uses, 

including fire suppression.

20.2.6 Groundwater Discharge Permit 

Initial conversations between UDWQ and CPM indicate that a groundwater discharge permit, including a 

water monitoring plan, will be required for the Project. The permit application will require the completion of 

sufficient baseline investigations in order to evaluate potential impacts to the groundwater resource, and if 

necessary, provide sufficient mitigation measures.  

In 2011, 2012, and 2013, a combination of 431 wells and holes were drilled on the Playa to help characterize 

the hydrogeologic conditions of the lease area. Groundwater samples were collected in 2012–2013 from 36 

existing wells throughout the Basin. In 2015, an additional 29 holes/wells were drilled on the Playa for the 

purpose of collecting additional hydrogeologic data. The hydrogeologic interpretation of data from these 

holes/wells will be included in the groundwater permit application for the Project.  

Subsequent to approval of the groundwater discharge application by the UDWQ, it may also be necessary to 

file a construction permit with UDWQ to validate the engineering and designs for the source of any potential 

impacts. This would include engineering designs for the tailings facility or other operations that may 

potentially impact groundwater. 

Actual permit processing time for the groundwater discharge permit is based upon the completeness and 

level of organization of the application. Groundwater discharge permit applications are typically processed in 

approximately six to nine months. 

Approvals for construction applications typically take a much shorter time, and can be approved in as few as 

three months. During the review of the discharge permit, it can be determined whether the construction 

permit will be required. 

20.2.7 Air Quality Permit 

CPM has been proactive in addressing the regulatory requirements to obtain an air quality permit by meeting 

with the UDAQ on numerous occasions and identifying the level of investigation required to obtain a permit.  

A Minor Source air permit application was approved by UDAQ in May 2014 to allow construction of on-Playa 

structures such as ponds and trenches. In 2017, CPM presented the updated Mining Plan to UDAQ. Due to 

the changes to the Mining Plan, UDAQ requires that a new Minor Source air permit application be submitted 

for construction and operation activities.  

20.2.8 General Multi-Sector Industrial Stormwater Permit 

The current Project design indicates that an application for a general multi-sector permit may need to be filed 

with the UDWQ. A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) must first be prepared as outlined in the 

general industrial permit. The SWPPP must be fully developed and permit coverage granted prior to breaking 

ground at the site.  

20.2.9 Army Corps of Engineer's Jurisdictional Waters 

The USACE issued an approved jurisdictional determination for the Sevier Playa on June 28, 2013 (U.S. Army 

Corps of Engineers, 2013). CPM completed a revised delineation of the Sevier Playa and Sevier River in 2017. 



NI 43-101 Technical Report Summarizing the Feasibility Study for the Sevier Playa Potash Project, Millard County, Utah 
Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 276 

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

CPM is in the process of requesting an approved jurisdictional determination for these potential areas 

impacted by all on- and off-lease Project features. 

20.2.10 County Conditional Use Permit and Other Permits 

Millard County will require a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for the Project. CUPs focus on direct impacts to 

the social fiber of the community and the impacts to infrastructure. The CUP will require an analysis of the 

impacts on social programs, including schools, medical facilities, law enforcement and employee housing, as 

well as traffic and noise. CPM has been proactive in maintaining good communication with the local 

community. To date, county officials and community members have expressed strong support for the Project 

and have expressed high interest in seeing the Project succeed. 

20.2.11 Water Treatment Plant Permit 

Water will be treated on-site to provide potable drinking water for staff. Engineering plans and specifications 

for all public drinking water projects must be approved by the UDDW prior to construction. Plans and 

specifications will be prepared by a Utah-licensed professional engineer. CPM will prepare and submit the 

application in Q2 2018.  

20.2.12 Waste Water Treatment Plant Permit 

The Project will feature a waste water treatment plant whereby the resulting water will be sent to the 

stormwater pond, and solid material transported to an off-site waste treatment facility to be used as 

compost. Disposal of sanitary waste will require a waste water treatment facility permit by the UDWQ. 

20.3 ESIA Progress 

As part of the Project ESIA, site-specific environmental studies and surveys within the Project area are either 

completed, or are in the process of being completed, to evaluate the existing environmental conditions in 

order to assess permitting and regulatory requirements and to support permit applications. Surveys and 

studies have been completed, or are currently being completed, as per the details outlined below. CPM is 

engaged closely with the BLM on ESIA activities in an effort to deliver a positive ROD as soon as possible to 

support the development plan contemplated by the FS. 

20.3.1 Environmental Setting 

 Air quality: the gathered data will be used to complete the impact analysis of the Project to support 

the permit applications and to assess compliance with the applicable ambient air quality standards at 

the Project boundary. 

 Archeological resources: activities include the completed cultural resource investigations to support 

exploration activities and planned pedestrian surveys to be conducted as per the programmatic 

agreement. Sites identified as part of the ongoing surveys will continue to be assessed for 

significance where significant sites will be avoided, mitigated, or managed, as appropriate. 

 Wildlife habitat, including threatened, endangered and sensitive species: the Project area has been 

surveyed to evaluate general wildlife habitat and to determine the presence of any threatened and 



NI 43-101 Technical Report Summarizing the Feasibility Study for the Sevier Playa Potash Project, Millard County, Utah 
Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc.

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

endangered species or their habitat protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). These 

surveys did not locate any threatened or endangered species. 

 Vegetation, including threatened, endangered, and sensitive species: no plant species listed under 

the ESA are known to occur in the Project area and the area does not contain habitat suitable for 

such species based on review of the Utah Conservation Data Center database and field surveys 

conducted for the Project. 

 Soils: an assessment of soil conditions for the Project was performed, based upon a review of 

published, unpublished, and web resource data from the Natural Resources Conservation Service 

(NRCS), formerly the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). This data was utilized to generate technical 

descriptions of the soil resource and background information within the context of the Project area. 

 Surface and groundwater: an integrated numerical groundwater flow and solute transport model of 

the Sevier Playa was developed based on interpolation of collected field data. This enabled the 

development of a numerical framework to support developing the brine-extraction components of a 

30-year mine plan. 

 Wetlands and waters of the United States: the USACE issued an approved jurisdictional 

determination for the Sevier Playa on June 28, 2013 that concluded that the Sevier Playa was "an 

intrastate isolated feature with no apparent interstate or foreign commerce connection." 

20.3.2 Site Monitoring, and Waste and Tailings Disposal 

20.3.2.1 Site Monitoring 

CPM has developed framework plans to address specific resource issues or management requirements.  

The site monitoring plans supplement information and requirements contained in the EIS, the Mining Plan, 

and the Plan of Development. Some of these plans contain mitigation measures or Best Management 

Practices (BMPs) that are in addition to the measures listed in the Mining Plan, Plan of Development, and EIS. 

Prior to construction, each of these plans will be finalized and implemented, as appropriate, during each 

phase of the Project, including construction, operation and maintenance, and closure.  

20.3.2.2 Waste and Tailings Management and Disposal 

Several types of non-hazardous and non-petroleum construction wastes would be generated during the 

Project. CPM would develop a solid and hazardous Waste Management Plan (WMP) to address 

transportation, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials expected to be used on the Project site 

during construction and operation and maintenance. 

20.3.3 Social or Community Impact 

The Project will present opportunities for new jobs in rural Utah and revenue for state, local, and federal 

governments. A Project of this scale represents a substantial economic opportunity for Millard County and 

the towns of Delta and Milford. Representatives of Millard County have expressed strong support for the 

Project. The Project is consistent with the Millard County general plan.  



NI 43-101 Technical Report Summarizing the Feasibility Study for the Sevier Playa Potash Project, Millard County, Utah 
Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 278 

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

Infrastructure and public services in Millard County may require upgrading and expansion to service the 

expanded population required to support the Project. Economic proceeds from having an operation like 

CPM's Project can be directed towards completing these improvements.  

The Utah "School and Institutional Trust Lands Management Act" requires SITLA to manage trust lands to 

optimize trust land revenues and increase the value of trust land holdings consistent with the balancing of 

short- and long-term interests so that long-term benefits are not lost in an effort to maximize short-term 

gains; and mandates the return of not less than fair market value for the use, sale or exchange of school and 

institutional trust assets. The Project will assist SITLA in meeting these objectives.  

20.3.4 Remediation and Reclamation 

Remediation and reclamation activities and associated costs have been accounted for in the FS cost estimate 

of the Project totaling $34 million USD. The reclamation and de-commissioning activities include: 

 Dismantling and removing any constructed buildings, structures, and linear infrastructure 

 Removal of any brine within the ponds, trenches, and/or Plant 

 Removal of any feed stockpiles 

 Breaching pre-concentration ponds to facilitate drainage leaving salt stockpiles in place 

 Re-contouring harvest ponds to approximate original contours 

 Backfilling wells, trenches, and canals 

 Burying/removal of imported gravel for roads and other uses 

It is anticipated that because the Playa is not currently suitable for supporting native or non-native 

vegetation, and that it will remain so after mining operations cease, final re-vegetation efforts likely would be 

limited to offsite facilities. The mine remediation and reclamation activities will be described in more detail in 

a future Project Reclamation Plan. This Plan will be used as the basis for more detailed third-party 

reclamation cost estimate in the future, and support/supplement the BLM/DOGM Mining Plan and Plan of 

Development.

ITEM 21: CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

The following section outlines the results and the basis of the Capital Cost, Operating Cost, and Deferred and 

Sustaining Capital estimates prepared during the FS for CPM. The Capital Cost estimate was performed as a 

joint collaboration with multiple parties' involvement, including Novopro, CPM, Norwest Corporation, and 

CH2M, as well as other external contractors and vendors. The Operating Cost estimate was developed based 

on engineering data prepared by Novopro, and cost data developed and prepared by Novopro or otherwise 

provided by CPM. The study aimed to produce a Capital Cost estimate, including Sustaining Capital, to ±15% 

accuracy, an Operating Cost estimate to ±10% accuracy and a de-commissioning cost estimate to ±30% 

accuracy. The overall study's content meets the requirement for AACE Class III estimate guidelines.

21.1.2 Intended Accuracy and Level of the Estimate 

The estimate meets the minimum requirements of a Class III estimate as defined in AACE International 

recommended practice no. 18R-97. 

The CAPEX estimate has an intended accuracy of ±15%. Some individual elements of the estimate may not 

achieve the target level of accuracy; however, the sum of all estimation elements falls within the parameters 

of the intended accuracy. 

21.1.3 Contracting Strategies  

The contracting strategy was based on the assumption that the Project delivery is performed as follows: 

 The development of the Playa and all associated earthworks and surface infrastructure are 

performed as Unit Rate contracts, developed and supervised by the Owner's team. 

 The Processing Plant, Fresh Water Wells, and pipelines are performed under the direction and 

coordination of an EPCM contractor. 

 The overhead power lines, electrical substations, and Rail Loadout are performed as EPC contracts, 

once again supervised by the Owner's team with assistance from the EPCM. 

The contracting strategy developed was based on multi-trade contractors to allow for efficient coordination 

between the various trades involved in any one area. Visits by the Project team to locally established sub-

contractors validated this approach and demonstrated that this methodology was feasible and should be 

encouraged.  

21.1.4 Equipment Supply Pricing 

The equipment supply pricing are based on budget and informal supplier quotations, depending on the size 

of the capital for each package.  

 Budget Quotes: 

o In general, budget quotations were sought for major equipment over $200,000 USD. The price 

request was based on general specifications and data sheets sent to multiple bidders. All bids 

received were evaluated for both technical and commercial acceptability, and final 

recommendations were issued. 

 Informal Quotes: 

o Informal quotes were requested for off-the-shelf equipment with low value. All bids received 

were commercially reviewed and evaluated. 

21.1.5 Material Take Off for Bulk Materials 

Engineering provided 3D modeling and preparation of drawings that allowed the engineer and estimator to 

estimate the quantity of earthworks, structural steel, concrete, piping, wiring and other bulks to be 

quantified. These take offs were subject to design growth addition given the level of engineering conducted 

in the FS.

21.1.6 Unit Rate Estimate 

 Multiple contractors for the Playa and for the Processing Plant visited the Project site to familiarize 

themselves with the Project and provide open guidance and reports on Unit Rates; and also to 

provide local experience on execution methodology. 

 Assistance was used extensively to develop and confirm Unit Rates and for a quantity of bulk 

materials and installation hours. 

 Unit rates used were verified with similar projects implemented recently to ensure that they 

corresponded to realistic costs.  

21.1.7 Labor Wage Rates (Crew) 

Multiple qualified contractors familiar with the scope and location provided crew rates for various trades and 

participated in reviews and a site visit. 

Following site visits to local sub-contractors, it was determined that 100% of the work force will be available 

locally. A proposed construction work week of 60 hours (6 days a week/10 hour a day) including 2 hours 

overtime per day set at one and a half time, and reflect "Open Shop" non-union craft was planned. 

21.1.8 Development of Indirect Capital Costs 

 Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management 

o EPCM services are estimated based on the scope defined as mainly the engineering, 

procurement, and construction management of the Processing Plant, with some support 

provided to the client on managing EPC packages of Rail Loadout and power supply.  

 Temporary Construction Facilities and Services 

o Estimated costs include all temporary roads, fencing and temporary buildings, laydown areas, 

material handling and warehousing, construction services (electrical energy production, fuel 

supply, temporary potable and waste water services, surveying, security, medical, janitorial, 

concrete testing, craft training, etc.) and allowances for construction and safety signs, plan 

sheds, barricades, guard rails, etc. 

 Vendor Representatives 

o The cost of vendors' representatives included in the CAPEX was intended to be sufficient to 

bring the Project to mechanical completion. An allowance for vendors' representatives was 

included in the estimate where no information was received from potential vendors for major 

budget quotations.  

 Spare Parts 

o Spare parts include first year initial spares and commissioning spares.  

 First Fills 

o First fills include on-site diesel fuel tank fills, reagents, hydraulic fluids, oils, lubricants, glycol, 

and other fills.

February 21, 2018  Page 283 

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

 Freight and Logistics Costs 

o In general, freight costs are based on vendor's proposals for each of the major purchase 

packages and are evaluated based on information provided by vendors and historical data to 

establish shipping weights, volumes, and or truck quantities.  

 Taxes and Duties 

o All tax and duties are carried in the Owner's costs. 

 Owner's Costs 

o All of the Owner's costs are developed by both Novopro and CPM. These included the Owner's 

team to oversee the EPC and EPCM packages, as well as the early hiring of the operational 

crew and their training. In addition, significant operational costs are estimated for the ponds 

and Playa, which will need to be in operation for several years prior to the start-up of the 

Processing Plant.  

 Contingencies 

o To calculate the contingency, an uncertainty profile for the Project was designed and a Monte 

Carlo simulation was run using "@Risk," a commercial risk evaluation program. A contingency 

workshop was held and members of the Owner's team, the engineering staff, estimating staff, 

project managers and other stakeholders participated in setting the drivers that could affect 

the accuracy of the estimate.  

21.1.8.1 Escalation 

Escalation was evaluated by developing a cash flow showing the CAPEX by quarter from the estimate base 

date through to mechanical completion. The cash flow was structured by estimation package and split into 

the various native currencies that compose the estimate. 

The cash flow serves as the basis for the high-level escalation analysis. The model was based on the following 

key elements: 

 Escalation period on purchase packages from estimate base date to award date. 

 Escalation on equipment and bulk materials based on the average over the last four years for Bureau 

of Labor Statistics published indices. 

21.1.8.2 Risk 

The Project risks were divided by area, whereby area experts were assigned to each category and instructed 

to list all possible risks and opportunities. Each risk and opportunity was evaluated as a group and assessed 

for probability and consequence using a risk assessment guide. 

The risk register containing all significant risks and opportunities was tabulated in accordance with the pre-

execution, construction, operations, and closure phases of the Project, which formed the basis for the 

generation of the P50 Capital Risk Budget. 

Refer to ‎Item 24: Other Relevant Data and Information, for more information.

21.2 Operating Cost Estimate 

21.2.1 Operating Cost Overview 

This section presents the annual Operating Cost estimate and the assumptions and source data. The OPEX 

has been divided into two parts, namely Direct and Indirect Operating Costs. Within both Direct and Indirect 

Costs, the OPEX is broken down further into OPEX items (e.g., power, diesel, etc.). 

The methodology used is considered to be in line with the requirements of a Class III estimate, estimated to 

be within ±10% accuracy as defined in AACE for the production of 372,030 STPY (337,500 MTPY) of SOP. 

Operating expenditures vary during the LoM; therefore, an expenditure model was developed to capture 

these variations in the financial model. 

21.2.2 Direct and Indirect Operating Costs 

Within the area-based Operating Costs, a division into the following four categories is made: 

 Direct Operating Costs: also referred to as "Variable," which vary with the production output of the 

Plant (e.g., per ton costs). 

 Indirect Operating Costs: also referred to as "Fixed," which do not typically vary with the production 

output of the Processing Plant. However, as the Playa output deceases in later years of the Project, 

some Indirect Operating Costs will decrease. 

 Contingency: a percentage of the total Direct and Indirect Operating Cost estimates. 

 Risk: a percentage of the total Direct and Indirect Operating Costs based on a Monte Carlo risk 

analysis, which itself was based on an FS-Close Out Risk Review Workshop, see ‎Item 24: Other 

Relevant Data and Information. 

21.2.3 Operating and Contracting Philosophy 

The Operating Costs included in this Operating Cost estimate assume the client will fully own-and-operate all 

operational aspects of the Project, from Mineral Resource extraction to rail loading with the exception of the 

rail cars, which will be leased. 

21.2.4 Sustaining Capital 

Sustaining Capital Costs are not considered Operating Costs as they are typically treated differently for 

accounting and tax purposes. See Section ‎21.3: Deferred and Sustaining Capital for more details.

21.2.5 Project Operating Cost Development 

21.2.5.1 Direct Operating Costs 

21.2.5.1.1 Utilities 

Power 

Power costs were based on the electrical load list's estimated continuous load, a power factor accounting for 

the reactive power, and the operating availability of each of the site areas.  

The total utility demand load estimated is 14.8 MW.  

Electricity is provided by the utility supplier, Rocky Mountain Power, who provided an average annual all-in 

tariff of $0.065 USD/kWh based on yearly average off-peak and on-peak rates.  

Propane 

Propane users in the Project are limited to the main product fluid bed dryer and the glazing fluid bed dryer, 

both located in the Dry Plant. Propane is delivered by truck and stored at site in a pressurized tank. The cost 

of propane delivered at site is $0.89 USD/gal ($0.23 USD/gal) per data provided by CPM. 

Total annual propane consumption in the Dry Plant is 985,294 gal/yr (3,729.7 m
3
/yr). 

Diesel 

Diesel users within the Project include all mobile equipment. 

Two types of diesel fuel are used based on whether the equipment is operated on county roads (on-road 

diesel) or within the Project's lease boundary (off-road diesel). The price of diesel delivered to the Project site 

is $2.70 USD/gal ($0.71 USD/L) for on-road diesel, while the price of off-road diesel is $2.10 USD/gal ($0.55 

USD/L), as provided by CPM. 

In total, mobile equipment diesel consumption is 920,481 gal/yr (3,484.4 m
3
/yr). 

Recharge Water 

An annual LoM average of 39,028 ac-ft/yr (48,140,257.4 m
3
/yr) of recharge water is required to maintain 

continuous brine extraction in the Playa over time as provided by CPM. Recharge water is obtained by 

diverting the Sevier River flow into a sump that allows the water to enter the Playa. 

Water diverted from the Sevier River is purchased at an annual average LoM price of $67.50 USD/ac-ft 

($0.055 USD/m
3
) as per the information provided by CPM. 

21.2.5.1.2 Reagents 

Main Processing Plant reagents include: 

MOP 

 105,592 STPY (95,791.5 MTPY) for 50% production increase per mass balance

 Amine agent, cost based on historical data, inflated to 2017 

 Delivery costs include container-based trucking to the Project site 

21.2.5.1.3 Maintenance Materials 

Project Maintenance Materials 

This includes general maintenance material costs for the Processing Plant and the Playa. These costs are 

treated as a percentage based on industry-specific standards of the total Project's Direct Capital Cost, 

excluding the Direct Capital Cost of the Rail Loadout Facility and mobile equipment. Maintenance materials 

costs are calculated using the following formula: 

 First five years:  

o Maintenance materials = 1.5% *(Project Total Direct Capital - Direct Capital of Rail Facility- 

Direct Capital of mobile equipment) 

o After first five years: Increase of 0.05% each year until a maximum of 2.5% is reached.  

Mobile Equipment Maintenance Materials and Replacement Cost 

Mobile equipment maintenance cost is estimated based on the operating schedule (distance traveled or 

hours of operation) applied to the mobile equipment list. The operating schedule is developed based on the 

Project's operating philosophy, equipment purpose, and shift and maintenance schedule. Replacement costs 

do not consider inflation since this will be addressed in financial modeling. Replacement and overhaul costs 

are annuitized over the life of the equipment.  

Rail Facility and Substation Maintenance Materials 

This includes general maintenance material costs for the Rail Loadout Facility and electrical substations. 

These costs are treated as a percentage of the total Direct Capital and are calculated using the following 

formula: 

Maintenance Materials = 1% Direct Capital of Rail Facility 

The costs included in this calculation include the logistics costs for the maintenance materials supply. 

Maintenance labor is included within the maintenance crew costs that were developed in the manpower 

estimate.

21.2.5.1.4 Railcar Leasing 

SOP product transport via rail requires 75 railcars that will be leased at $350 USD per month per railcar. 

21.2.5.2 Indirect Operating Costs 

21.2.5.2.1 Manpower 

The manpower estimate is based on the following: 

 Project operations organization structure 

 Shift schedules 

o Day-shift (8 hours) 

o 12-hour shift rotation (12 hours), with 42-hour work week for station fill positions 

o 24/7 coverage with 8-hour shift rotation, for vehicle driving positions in the ponds. 16 per day 

with 8-hour shift rotation for SOP/MOP trucks. Both cases remain below the Department of 

Transportation maximum of 11 hours per day. 

o Office staff and maintenance crews will work on day shifts.  

21.2.5.2.2 Property and Liability Insurances 

Insurance costs are provided at an annual premium of 1.25% of the gross revenue based on a SOP sale price 

of $630 USD/st ($571.5 USD/mt). 

21.2.5.2.3 Property Taxes 

Property taxes are based on a 1% applied to the total Project Direct Capital, excluding labor costs. 

21.2.5.3 Risk 

A P50 risk budget applied to the OPEX represents 4.45% of the total OPEX, based on a completed Monte 

Carlo risk analysis.  

21.2.5.4 Contingency 

Contingency applied to the OPEX represents 5% of the total OPEX based on the amount of costs associated to 

risk in the Project.

ITEM 22: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 Basis of Analysis 

The economic analysis used a discounted cash flow model (Economic Model). The study produced a Capital 

Cost estimate, including Sustaining Capital, to ±15% accuracy, an Operating Cost estimate to ±10% accuracy, 

and a de-commissioning cost estimate to ±30% accuracy. The overall study's content meets the requirement 

for AACE Class III estimate guidelines. The Capital and Operating Costs presented in ‎Item 21: Capital and 

Operating Costs of this Technical Report, and used in this economic analysis, are based on the recovery 

methods described in previous sections of this Technical Report. 

The Economic Model is based on the LoM extraction and recovery of 6,791,332 short tons (6,161,000 metric 

tonnes) of potassium sulfate from Playa sources, and production of 3,397,845 short tons (3,082,477 metric 

tonnes) of potassium sulfate from the reaction of purchased potassium chloride with the excess sulfates 

present in the Playa brine fed to the Processing Plant. Total production over the LoM is 10,189,189 short tons 

(9,243,477 metric tonnes). For the determination of the LoM, only Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves 

were used. 

The IRR, NPV, and payback period are calculated based on 100% equity financing, although it is anticipated 

that CPM would pursue debt financing alternatives for the Project. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to 

assess the impact of variances in the Project's Capital and Operating Costs, revenues, inflation, and discount 

rate to demonstrate the effects of these variances on Project economics. 

22.2 Economic Model Parameters 

The parameters and assumptions used in the Economic Model are as follows: 

 One-year pre-execution (2018) 

 Four-year construction period, beginning in January 2019 

 Three-year production ramp-up, starting in 2022 with full production achieved at the end of 2025 

o 30,314 short tons (27,500 metric tonnes) in 2022 

o 234,792 short tons (213,000 metric tonnes) in 2023 

o 282,605 short tons (256,375 metric tonnes) in 2024 

o 372,030 short tons (337,500 metric tonnes) in 2025 through 2041 

o Declining to 245,936 short tons (223,110 metric tonnes) in 2050, followed by 316,212 short tons 

(286,863 metric tonnes) in the final two years (2051 and 2052) of production 

 The first decrease in Processing Plant production due to brine grade decrease occurs in 2042 

 The last two years of Processing Plant production (2051 and 2052) are sustained from heel brine in 

the pond as the Playa is shut down during those two years 

 Discount rate has been set at 8% 

 Revenue is based on an SOP price of $572 USD/st ($630 USD/mt) across all SOP products produced. 

This price is inflated at 2% per annum within the Economic Model, i.e. on the same basis as all other 

financial data during the period of operations

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

 Initial Capital Costs estimated at $389,843,456 USD 

 Deferred Capital Costs estimated at $8,826,220 USD 

 Sustaining Capital Costs estimated at $247,819,491 USD over the LoM, including additional Playa 

improvements, Sustaining Capital, and de-commissioning and reclamation 

 The total un-inflated average cash Operating Costs, including risk and contingency are estimated to 

be $201 USD/st ($222 USD/mt) 

 All Capital Costs were inflated during the construction period at a rate of 1.27% per annum 

 All post-initial construction Capital (Sustaining and Deferred) and Operating Expenditures were 

inflated at 2% per annum beginning in 2019 

 Annual production royalties estimated at 5.61% of gross revenue, less allowable reagent cost 

deductions 

 Estimated effective tax rate of approximately 15.6%, based on the assumptions described below 

 Post-performance tax credit from the state of Utah of approximately $112.5 million 

 All project-related expenses incurred prior to the effective date of this Report are considered as sunk 

costs and are not included in this economic analysis. Bridge engineering expenses projected after the 

effective date of this Report, but before the start of construction, are also not included 

Additional details of the variables used in the discounted cash flow model, including the annual cash flow, 

Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization 

(EBITDA), and production schedule, can be found in Appendix A: Project Annual Cash Flow Forecast. 

22.3 Taxation 

The Project is subject to income taxation at the following two levels: (1) federal income tax and (2) state 

income tax, based on federal taxable income. Federal taxable income is calculated based on gross revenues 

less operating expenses, royalties, and depreciation. Other taxable income deductions and credits included in 

the economic analysis and allowed under the federal tax code include the percentage depletion deduction 

(14% of gross revenues less royalties). This economic analysis also forecasts the benefit of a state economic 

development tax credit incentive estimated at approximately $112.5 million USD over 20 years.  

Due to the fact that state income taxes are deductible for federal income tax purposes, a combined federal 

and state income tax rate of 24.95% was used in calculating the income tax expense. The projected effective 

tax rate for the Project is approximately 15.6%. 

The Project is also assessed an annual property tax, which has been included in the general and 

administrative cash Operating Costs. 

22.4 Summary 

The economic analysis is conducted to determine the value of the Project using the NPV and IRR financial 

metrics. NPV is the summation of the present value of all future cash inflows and outflows of the Project. 

A positive NPV indicates that the Project provides a financial return in excess of the capital requirements. IRR 

is the annual rate of return that makes the NPV of all cash flows equal to zero. In other words, it is the

discount rate at which the present value of all cash flows equals zero. The payback period, which is based on 

the undiscounted free cash flow, is the number of years required to repay the initial capital outflows.  

The results of the economic analysis are positive, and NPV, IRR, and payback period are summarized in Table 

‎22-1. The NPV at an 8% discount rate is $900 million USD on a pre-tax basis, and $730 million USD on a post-

tax basis, with a pre-tax IRR of 23.0% and a post-tax IRR of 20.8%. Based on the free cash flow generated by 

the Project, the payback period on a post-tax basis is estimated to be approximately 4.5 years from first 

production of saleable product. The economic analysis and Economic Model outputs indicate a strong project 

that is commercially viable and delivers robust project metrics.

Over the Project's LoM, the Economic Model is based on the production and sale of 10,189,189 short tons 

(9,243,477 metric tonnes) of SOP, and projects $8.6 billion USD in gross revenues with $3.0 billion USD in 

operating expenses and $472 million USD in royalties, thereby resulting in a gross margin (revenue less cash 

Operating Costs) of $5.6 billion USD (65%) and an operating margin of $5.1 billion USD (59%). The Economic 

Model also projects $4.3 billion USD of pre-tax free cash flow and $3.6 billion USD of post-tax free cash flow.  

22.5 Sensitivity Analysis 

The completed sensitivity analysis determined which variable(s) had the greatest impact on the Project 

economics. The results, presented in Table ‎22-2 as well as in Figure ‎22-1, Figure ‎22-2, Figure ‎22-3, Figure 

‎22-4, and Figure ‎22-5, illustrate the relative sensitivities of the various parameters to the Project NPV and 

IRR, on a pre-tax and post-tax basis. The analysis demonstrated that, of the variables analyzed, the IRR and 

NPV are most sensitive to variances in SOP price. For every 5% increase (or decrease) in the SOP price, the 

post-tax NPV increased (or decreased) by approximately $86 million USD, and the post-tax IRR increased (or 

decreased) by an approximate average of 1.2%. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrates that pre-tax and 

post-tax NPV are very sensitive to the discount rate.

ITEM 24: OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

24.1 Risk Assessment and Management 

A risk review and quantification workshop was done to identify and assign probabilities to the risks involved 

in this Project. A Monte Carlo analysis was performed on the identified risks to calculate the P50 monetary 

value of the Project's risks. Finally, the residual risks of the Project were identified, along with the main points 

to be included as part of a Risk Mitigation Plan.

24.1.2 Results 

24.1.2.1 Net P50 Capital Risk  

At the conclusion of the FS Close-Out Joint Risk Review Workshop, a total of 98 risks and opportunities were 

tabulated, with the complete risk register divided according to the Project timeline. Risk levels were 

calculated for each item in the register based on the probability of occurrence and the impact of the risk 

materialization on the Project. A risk confidence level of 50% (P50) was applied. The P50 Capital Risk Budget 

was applied within the Project Capital and Operating Cost respectively. The complete FS close-out risk 

register is attached to this report in Appendix B: Risk Register. 

Table ‎24-1 presents the final results of the net P50 Capital and Operating Risk Budget. As can be seen in this 

table, the total P50 Capital Risk Budget for the Project Capital Cost is $8,138,759 USD.

24.1.2.2 Risk Distribution Project Phases 

Cost-related risks (i.e., excluding monetized schedule delays) for the construction and operation phase are 

approximately the same (i.e., 50% each). This is due to the fact that a significant number of construction 

activities continue throughout the life of the Project, such as mine expansions, in the form of the continued 

expansion of extraction trenches, the incorporation of extraction wells within the siliceous clay, and the berm 

raises associated with the pre-concentration ponds.

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

24.1.2.3 Risk Distribution in Project Areas 

The evaluation of cost-related risks across all Project phases (pre-execution, construction, operations and 

closure) indicates that the majority (i.e., 60%) of the cost-related risk in this Project are attributed to the 

Playa and ponds. In particular, the risks around the Playa works focused on the following considerations: 

 Accessibility and ground-bearing pressure 

 Construction productivity 

 Weather and timing 

The evaluation of schedule-related risks across all Project phases indicates that the main schedule-related 

risks in this Project are attributed to permitting and the evaporation ponds. This is due to following: 

 The criticality in achieving the necessary level of permitting in order to proceed with Project 

financing and implementation objectives. 

 The consequences associated with delays experienced in pond construction and filling, resulting in 

missing an evaporation season, and delaying production. Missing an evaporation season has the 

potential to delay production by a full year. 

24.1.3 Risk Mitigation Plan 

The risk analysis showed that a number of the Project risks demonstrate transferability. In this context, 

"transferability" is the ability to mitigate risks by transferring the risk to another party, who are not only 

better positioned and experienced to mitigate the risk, but can also devote more effort in said mitigation 

than the Project Owner could before the risk was transferred.  

A Risk Mitigation Plan will be developed early in the pre-execution phase. Some of the main mitigation 

measures associated with the risk review are summarized below: 

 Plan for ground-breaking in the month of January 2019 

 Make early commitments with earthworks contractors for equipment mobilization 

 Have back-up and/or secondary earthworks contractors to mitigate schedule risks 

 Conduct geotechnical investigations on Rail Loadout Facility and spur line 

 Correlate soil bearing capacity with halite base strength and equipment bearing pressure 

 Mitigate construction delays, learning curve delays and risk of missing an evaporation season with 

field testing and constructability testing in pre-execution (Bridge Engineering) phase 

 Conduct authentic salts process testwork demonstration run (with pilot pond salts) 

 Develop training and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) programs and protocols to ensure safe 

operations on site and quick-ramp up 

 Maximize risk transferability.

ITEM 25: INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

25.1 Geology, Hydrogeology, Extraction and Mining Methodology, and Mineral Resources and Reserves 

The FS was initiated using the results of the PFS issued in 2013 as a starting point for design and investigation.  

During the execution of the FS, a number of fundamental changes to the Project were made from the PFS. 

These fundamental changes are described in the sections below: 

25.1.1 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

 CPM successfully conducted significant exploration drilling, hydrologic, and geotechnical testing on 

the Playa from 2011 through 2016. 

 Brine and sediment analysis performed during the field testing and drilling programs were conducted 

by certified laboratories. 

 Lithologic and analytical data underwent rigorous QA/QC. 

 Anion concentrations and specific gravity analyses required slight adjustments to achieve mass 

balance. 

25.1.2 Hydrogeology 

 The target Playa brine feed grade to the pre-concentration ponds was reduced by a factor of 0.67 to 

provide a consistent brine grade throughout the majority of the LoM.  

 A new playa-wide numerical hydrogeologic model was constructed which included data collected 

from additional field and laboratory testwork conducted between the PFS and FS.  

 An integrated numerical groundwater flow and solute transport model was constructed using the 

density-dependent and viscosity-coupled implementation of MFSF to evaluate the extractability of 

brine from the Playa sediments and potential brine extraction plans.  

 Hydrologic and geological information collected over numerous field seasons, along with literature 

values, were integrated into the model to improve the understanding of the groundwater flow and 

transport components of the conceptual model of the Playa aquifer system.  

25.1.3 Extraction and Mining Methodology 

 Design of the trenches changed from a sloped wall design to a stepped design based on field trials. 

This design is intended to facilitate long term trench stability.  

 The FS mine plan relies on an different buildout of the mine extraction infrastructure to extract the 

brine, with an earlier reliance on recharge water infrastructure.  

 The FS infrastructure includes a fully developed TMA and storage area, which was not fully 

developed in the PFS. 

 The proposed mining method involves a combination of extraction and recharge trenches, and 

drilled wells to collect the subsurface brine. Initial extraction will drain brine Mineral Resource from 

the mobile porosity in the Playa aquifers. Introduction of fresh recharge water will then facilitate the 



NI 43-101 Technical Report Summarizing the Feasibility Study for the Sevier Playa Potash Project, Millard County, Utah

process of mass transfer of Mineral Resource from brine in the immobile porosity into the drainable 

porosity of the Playa aquifers for continued extraction to meet production goals.  

 The pre-concentration ponds will require regular berm raises to support the precipitate deposition 

during the concentration and evaporation phase. 

 A waste storage area in the southwestern portion of the Playa has been developed to contain purge 

brine and flotation tailings.  

25.1.4 Mineral Resources and Reserves 

 A total Measured plus Indicated in-place brine Mineral Resource is estimated to be 6,777 million 

short tons (6,148 million metric tonnes) from which K
+
 concentrations create a Measured plus 

Indicated in-place potassium Resource of 17.09 million short tons (15.51 million metric tonnes). 

Converting to K2SO4 provides an estimated Measured plus Indicated Mineral equivalent Resource 

totaling 38.08 million short tons (34.55 million metric tonnes) for the Project.  

 Measured plus Indicated potentially extractable equivalent K2SO4 Resource from the potentially 

extractable Measured plus Indicated brine is calculated to be approximately 10.5 million short tons 

(9.538 million metric tonnes), based on the potentially extractable K
+
 Resource assuming recovery by 

specific yield only. The potentially extractable Mineral Resources do not include the additional K
+
 

that becomes available through Mineral Reserves produced through the recharge and mass transfer 

processes. 

 The FS has demonstrated that the Project is economically viable. As a result of the favorable 

economic results presented in the FS, in-place Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources have been 

upgraded to Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. 

 Numerical groundwater flow and transport models were developed that integrate hydrogeologic 

information collected over the last several years to improve the understanding of the groundwater 

flow and transport components of the conceptual model of the Playa aquifer system. This integrated 

groundwater flow and transport model accommodates the specific yield, recharge, and mass transfer 

processes, and provided a numerical framework to support the development of the mine plan and 

the estimation of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. Only in-place Measured plus Indicated 

Mineral Resources were used in this determination. 

 Resultant Proven and Probable K2SO4 Available Mineral Reserves total 8.525 million short tons 

(7.734 million metric tonnes). Conversion from K
+
 to K2SO4 production uses a ratio of 

2.2285 (rounded), which is based on atomic weights. Proven and Probable K2SO4 Produced Mineral 

Reserves total 6.803 million short tons (6.171 million metric tonnes). 

 The forecast simulations indicate that the proposed mine plan, with the noted configuration and 

modeling assumptions, could meet the brine-extraction targets (flow rates and potassium grade 

targets were 30,000 gpm [6,813.8 m
3
/h] and 2,240 mg/L respectively), for approximately two-thirds 

of the 30-year LoM.  

 It is anticipated that the brine grade will decline by approximately 5% per year for the remaining 

simulation period. The expected decline has been accounted for in the pond and process design and 

in projected pond and process efficiencies by Novopro, and is accounted for in these estimated 

Available Mineral Reserves of potassium. The Mineral Reserve figures reported in the FS will support 

the annual SOP production profile over the life of the Project.

The accuracy of Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity of 

available data, and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Elements of the study that 

form the basis of the Mineral Reserve estimation include sampling and analytical methodology, the 

hydrostratigraphic model construction and understanding of brine and sediment properties and variability, 

and the construction and calibration of the integrated groundwater flow and mass transport numerical 

models. These tasks were performed in succession, with standard validation and calibration exercises 

performed throughout each stage, culminating in the integrated numerical models from which the Mineral 

Reserve estimations have been sourced. This has led to a reasonable level of confidence that the Playa will be 

able to produce the quantities and grade of brine presented as Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves in this 

Report. 

Given the data available at the time this Report was prepared, the estimates presented herein are considered 

reasonable. However, they should be accepted with the understanding that additional data and analysis 

available subsequent to the date of the estimates may necessitate revision. These revisions may be material. 

There is no guarantee that all or any part of the estimated Mineral Resources or Reserves will be recoverable. 

25.2 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact 

Site-specific environmental studies and surveys within the Project area have either been completed, or are in 

the process of being completed, to evaluate the existing environmental conditions in order to assess 

permitting and regulatory requirements and to support permit applications.  

Surveys and studies that have been, or are currently being, completed are the following: 

 Air quality 

 Archeological resources 

 Wildlife habitat 

 Vegetation 

 Soils 

 Surface and groundwater 

 Wetlands and waters of the United States 

To date, the surveys have not located or identified any threatened, endangered or sensitive species of 

wildlife or vegetation. Archeological sites identified will continue to be assessed for significance, and will be 

avoided, mitigated or managed as appropriate. 

The Project will present opportunities for new jobs in rural Utah and revenue for state, local, and federal 

governments. A Project of this scale represents a substantial economic opportunity for Millard County and 

the towns of Delta and Milford. Coordination with the federal, state and county authorities was performed, 

and will continue during the next phases of the Project. Representatives of Millard County have expressed 

strong support for the Project. 

25.3 Ponds and Processing 

The following points detail the results and conclusions of the evaporation pond and processing testwork and 

development.

 A complete overhaul of the Wet Plant process was implemented leading to the current design. These 

changes include: 

o Increase in the SOP conversion ratio due to the modification of the intermediate process 

minerals. 

o The forced evaporation circuit was eliminated by recycling the crystallizer effluent back to the 

evaporation ponds. This also eliminated the need for the natural gas pipeline required for the 

forced evaporation circuit used in the PFS.  

o The addition of MOP to the SOP crystallizer increasing SOP production by 50%.   

 Brine conveyance from the pre-concentration ponds to the production ponds is facilitated by a brine 

transfer canal improving operational efficiencies and reducing costs.  

 A single summer season of on-site Class A pan evaporation testing indicated that the Playa exhibits 

an evaporation rate higher than evaporation rates recorded adjacent to the Great Salt Lake, enough 

to warrant a 25% increase to the evaporation rate used for the PFS. 

 Pilot pond field tests confirmed the effective precipitation and removal of halite from the Playa brine 

via pre-concentration. Mineralogy of the crude potash salts in the pilot ponds demonstrated a minor 

but measurable deviation from the Process Model, and a minor but measurable increase in retention 

of potassium. These deviations require further review in the next phase and could lead to a potential 

8% increase in the Project pond area. This item was included in the Project's Capital Risk Budget. 

 Pilot pond field tests successfully demonstrated the harvesting methodology developed in the FS 

consisting of draining, windrowing, and collection of pond salts. 

 The pilot pond field tests successfully produced 16.5 short tons (15 metric tonnes) of feed for future 

authentic salt testing. 

 Based on the modeled pond mineralogy, bench-scale testwork confirmed the production of on-spec 

SOP product via the planned processing route consisting of crushing, conversion, flotation, leaching 

and SOP crystallization at the nominal combined recovery of 79.79% for the ponds and process. The 

nominal unit grade and recoveries of each unit operation were confirmed by bench-scale testwork, 

which also demonstrated robustness with respect to mineralogical changes in the Plant feed and 

operating temperatures. The process also demonstrated a good degree of seasonal robustness as 

analyzed via the seasonal process sensitivity analysis (a modeling exercise combined with a review of 

climatic data). 

 The Playa brine contains six times excess sulfate in relation to SOP. MOP addition into the SOP 

crystallizer was demonstrated in the bench scale testwork to provide an SOP production increase of 

50%. 

 Local evaporation rates indicate an average halite deposition rate of 6 in/yr (15.2 cm/yr) in the 

ponds, thus requiring two years to produce the minimum 12-inch (30.5-centimeter) halite base 

foundation required in the production ponds for harvesting vehicles support. 

 The FS process design succeeded in effectively converting the PFS process from a high-temperature, 

forced-evaporation route to a simpler and more energy efficient low-temperature route, maximizing 

the use of evaporation ponds. The ponds and process design change succeeded in reducing the 

energy demand by 97%, increasing production by 13% via the addition of MOP, increasing recovery 

by 11% and decreasing pond area by 12%. This was accomplished while maintaining a constant Playa 

flow rate of 29,946 gpm (6,801.5 m
3
/h) at a potassium content of 2,240 mg/L. Water consumption

within the Processing Plant increased marginally; however, the volume of fresh water required to 

support the FS process design still falls within the allotted fresh water rights for the Project. These 

changes are summarized in Table ‎25-1.

 Total SOP production over LoM is 10.19 million short tons (9.244 million metric tonnes), with 

6.791 million short tons (6.161 million metric tonnes) from Playa-sourced brine and 3.397 million 

short tons (3.082 million metric tonnes) produced through MOP reaction. 

25.4 Site Selection 

 The fat clay long term leakage was assessed as 0.06 in/yr (1.6 mm/yr) from field trials. The fat clay 

was considered a feasible sealing material for berm construction within the pre-concentration and 

production ponds, and TMA 

 Due to the size of the pre-concentration ponds, the selected location must be in a relatively level 

area to minimize earthworks and to sterilize as little resource as possible. This was accomplished by 

placing these ponds to the very north of the Playa, where the topography is relatively flat, covering 

an area of low-grade Resource.  

 The production ponds were subject to the same criteria as the pre-concentration ponds, with the 

added requirement of being in proximity to the Processing Plant to minimize hauling distances of the 

crude salts. This was accomplished by locating the harvesting ponds to the very south of the Playa.

 The site selected for the Processing Plant met the location criteria of being in proximity to the 

harvest ponds, having a relatively level surface to minimize earthworks, and having an adequate 

bearing capacity to allow for conventional foundations. 

 The layout generated for the Processing Plant provides for safe and direct access for both the crude 

salt harvesting vehicles and the SOP product transport trucks to their discharge and loading points. 

25.5 Power Supply 

 Rocky Mountain Power has confirmed they are able to provide the 18 MW requested for the Project, 

which has a total utility demand load of 14.8 MW. The Project would tie-in to the existing Black Rock 

Substation located approximately 46 miles (74 kilometers) to the north-east of the Processing Plant 

site. 

 ECI has performed preliminary engineering and demonstrated the feasibility of routing a 69-kV 

overhead power line from the Black Rock Substation to the Processing Plant main substation, and 

from the substation to the Rail Loadout Facility with a 12.47-kV overhead power line.  

 Solar panels equipped with storage batteries have proved to be a more cost-effective solution for 

the brine extraction wells as compared to conventional overhead power lines. Similarly, for the brine 

lift stations along the eastern brine canal, the use of solar panels for daytime operation only have 

also proven to be a more cost-effective solution to overhead power lines.  

25.6 Recharge Water Supply 

Recharge of water into the subsurface extraction zone is required for sustainable long-term operation to 

achieve the target brine production rate. The amount of recharge water required must at least equal the 

target Playa brine extraction rate of 48,339 ac-ft/yr or 29,946 gpm (6,801.5 m
3
/h). Sources of recharge water 

consist of stream inflow from the Sevier River to the Playa, runoff from watersheds surrounding the Playa, 

precipitation directly onto the surface of the Playa, and mountain-block recharge (i.e., subsurface inflow). 

The average amount of purchased recharge water required during non-surplus and small-surplus flow years 

(accounting for 10% transmission loss) is 39,028 ac-ft (48,140,257.4 m
3
). The FS includes 39,028 ac-ft 

(48,140,257.4 m
3
) of recharge water, which will be purchased annually over the life of the Project.  

25.7 Fresh Water Supply 

The aquifer and borehole testing program executed for the Project indicate high-quality groundwater is 

present in the PMQ, which can be used to serve site process water demands. A total of four groundwater 

production wells are anticipated to satisfy the Facility's needs for both the Processing Plant and Rail Loadout 

Facility.  

25.8 Project Costs (CAPEX, OPEX, Deferred and Sustaining Capital) and Project Economics 

The study produced a Capital Cost estimate including Sustaining Capital to ±15% accuracy, an Operating Cost 

estimate to ±10% accuracy and a de-commissioning cost estimate to ±30% accuracy. The overall study's 

content meets the requirement for AACE Class III estimate guidelines.

Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 308 

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

Development of the AACE Class III ±15% Capital Cost estimates resulted in a total Direct and Indirect CAPEX of 

approximately $390 million USD, including a P50 contingency of $32 million USD. Inflation and escalation 

costs of $14.1 million USD and a Project P50 risk budget of $8.1 million USD resulted in the Project's total 

CAPEX to approximately $412 million USD. 

The AACE Class III ±10% Operating Cost estimate developed as part of the FS established a total annual 

Operating Cost of $191.82 USD/st ($211.45 USD/mt), FOB Rail Loadout Facility, after the Processing Plant is at 

full production capacity of 372,030 STPY (337,500 MTPY). The annual un-inflated average OPEX, including risk 

and contingency, is estimated to be $201 USD/st ($222/mt). 

The Deferred and Sustaining Capital Cost estimate over the 30-year LoM is estimated to be a total of 

$222.6 million USD with AACE Class III ±15% precision. The de-commissioning cost estimate is anticipated to 

be a total of $34.0 million USD with ±30% precision. 

As part of the FS, a comprehensive Economic Model was developed to evaluate the Project's economics. 

The results of the Economic Model determined a pre-tax NPV of $900 million USD and pre-tax IRR of 23.0%, 

with a post-tax NPV of $730 million USD and post-tax IRR 20.8%. The Economic Model and economics 

indicate a strong project with low sensitivity to OPEX and CAPEX. The Project is the most sensitive to SOP 

price. The Project is commercially viable and delivers robust project metrics. 

25.9 Marketing 

A series of research and review studies were conducted over the course of the FS to assess the SOP market. 

This included a global SOP review of the existing and forecast supply and demand levels. As a result, the base 

case Project production profile includes an 80/20 split of Granular to Water-Soluble product production 

levels, as these grades show the greatest potential for demand increases.  

For the purposes of financial modeling, CPM has used a starting SOP price of $572 USD/st ($630 USD/mt), 

FOB Rail Loadout Facility, based on the market research conducted and data collected throughout the FS. 

This price is inflated within the Economic Model on the same basis as all other financial data during the 

period of operations. 

25.10 Risk 

The evaluation of cost-related risks across all Project phases (pre-execution, construction, operations and 

closure) indicates that the majority (i.e., 60%) of the cost-related risk in this Project are attributed to the 

Playa and ponds. In particular, the risks around the Playa works focused on the following considerations: 

 Accessibility and ground-bearing pressure 

 Construction productivity 

 Weather and timing 

The evaluation of schedule-related risks across all Project phases indicates that 77% of the schedule-related 

risks in this Project are attributed to permitting and the evaporation ponds. This is due to following: 

 The criticality in achieving the necessary level of permitting in order to proceed with Project 

financing and implementation objectives.

Prepared for Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. 
February 21, 2018  Page 309 

Novopro Projects Inc. 
 

 The consequences associated with delays experienced in pond construction and filling, resulting in 

missing an evaporation season, and delaying production. Missing an evaporation season has the 

potential to delay production by a full year. 

Risk is fairly evenly distributed between the construction and operation phases. This is due to the on-going 

mine expansion related to the Project after the construction phase. 

In concluding the risk analysis, the engineer must communicate the Project's Residual Risks (i.e., risks that 

remain un-mitigated and unaccounted for in terms of Capital or Operation Risk Budget). These are the 

Project's "Accepted" risks at this stage in the Project going forward and should be diligently considered by 

the Project Owner. Where applicable, potential mitigation measures have been identified and are listed in 

Section 24.1.4: Residual Risks. These risks are listed below: 

 Geotechnical: 

o Leakage rates higher than design in pre-concentration and production ponds, requiring 

increased Playa flow and pond area to maintain production, reducing LoM 

o Impact of floods on ponds, trenches, and electrical infrastructure, stopping production and/or 

loss of inventory 

o Dike seismic stability under-designed, resulting in catastrophic breach in ponds 

 Ponds: 

o Constructability over existing CPM salt ponds, resulting in delay issues and/or relocation of 

pond area 

 Market: 

o MOP purchase price fluctuations 

o SOP sales price fluctuations 

 Mining and Geology: 

o Drought and lack of recharge water, resulting in reduced brine flow rates 

25.11 Project Execution 

The Project Execution Plan is structured to accommodate the staged-gate approach to project funding, to 

mitigate risks that are identified for the Project, and take into account the local evaporation seasons.  

The execution commences with a Bridge Engineering phase directly after funding for this effort is approved. 

The work performed during the Bridge Engineering phase will mitigate risks identified, increase cost 

certainty, and perform tasks required to maintain the Project schedule.  

The Bridge Engineering will complete the following main activities: 

 Value engineering and process improvement investigations 

 Engage contractors to complete site works investigations 

 Advance the design of the areas identified to be on the critical path 

 Obtain contractor proposals and pricing for:

o EPC contracts, for engineering, procurement and construction at a fixed price 

o Unit Rate contracts, for earthworks for trenches, pond berms, roads and underground services  

o EPCM contract for the engineering and construction management for areas with limited 

definition not allowing for price certainty 

 Engage the Playa earthworks contractor and pre-order the specialized earthmoving equipment 

 Produce all basic engineering documents necessary to support a revised AACE Class III estimate

 Further site-specific geotechnical program for the Playa, the Plant site, and the Rail Loadout Facility 

(some geotechnical programs for the Processing Plant and the Playa can be completed during the 

implementation phase given the extended construction period). 

 Continue the environmental studies and surveys within the Project area according to the authorities 

having jurisdiction. 

26.4 Process Testwork 

Conduct additional testwork to validate the viability of the process employed by the Project with actual 

Playa-generated salts. The test plan focuses on testing all of the major unit operations. The testwork will also 

provide additional data and information for specifying and selecting the process equipment. The testwork 

will focus around the following areas: 

 Sevier salt characterization 

 Crushing 

 Conversion 

 Flotation 

 Tailings analysis 

 Leaching 

 Crystallization 

 Filtration (intermediate potassium salt/halite) 

 SOP crystallization 

 SOP solid-liquid separation (centrifugation) 

 Drying 

 Compaction 

26.5 Critical Construction Equipment 

As part of the Bridge Engineering phase budget, capital has been assigned to place orders for critical 

construction equipment. This equipment is for construction activities pertaining to the Playa and ponds that 

needs to take place early in 2019.
