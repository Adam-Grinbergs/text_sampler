3.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

First Majestic Silver Corp. (FMS) retained Pincock, Allen and Holt (PAH) a division of Australia-based 
Runge, Inc. to prepare a Technical Report for the silver / lead deposit of La Encantada Silver Mine located 
in the Municipality of Ocampo, Coahuila State, and México. This report is an update of Technical Report 
Amended of July 24, 2007, which was prepared by PAH and published in SEDAR in July 25, 2007. This 
report meets the requirements and is compliant with NI 43-101 and conforms to Form 43-101F1 for 
technical reports. 

La Encantada Silver Mine is owned and operated by Minera La Encantada, S.A. de C.V., and a wholly-
owned Mexican subsidiary of FMS. La Encantada Silver Mine consists of an industrial complex that 
includes underground silver / lead mining, a flotation ore processing plant, water wells and pipeline, 
airport, housing and camp facilities.  The La Encantada mine was operated by Peñoles for a period of 
about 25 years, until June 2002.  Desmín leased the property from Peñoles and operated the mine and 
processing plant from July 1, 2004 until November 1, 2006 when Desmin was acquired by FMS.  Desmín 
and FMS have mined and processed approximately 175,000 tonnes of ore to October 31, 2007. 

FMS owns mining rights that cover 2,826 hectares (6,982 acres) within 18 titled concessions and 2 claim 
applications.  Minera La Encantada has acquired, from the Ejido Tenochtitlán, Municipality of Ocampo, 
under expropriation regulations, surface land ownership of 1,343 hectares (3,319 acres) where mine, 
plant, housing, camp and associated facilities are installed.  It also owns the surface rights, installations 
and water rights for two water wells at El Granizo, which supply La Encantada water needs. 

Estimated proven and probable reserves and measured and indicated resources for La Encantada, as of 
October 31, 2007, are presented in Table 3-1.  These include proven and probable reserves of 1.2 million 
tonnes at 312 g/tonne (10.03 oz) Ag, and 1.77 percent (39 lb/tonne) Pb, for a total contained silver 
equivalent, inclusive of Pb credit, of 12.6 million ounces. 

La Encantada reserves have been estimated at a Cutoff Grade of 256 g/tonne Ag only, and 241 g/tonne 
Ag equivalent net of Pb credit. 

During the period of June through October, 2007 FMS mined 21,293 tonnes of ore from the May 31 
proven and probable reserves, in addition of other minerals extracted from different areas of the mine for 
a total of 162,279 tonnes.  To October 31, the La Encantada exploration programs and underground 
development increased reserves by 575,600 tonnes.  These were estimated from the following areas: 
Breccia Milagros, Azul y Oro, Breccia Keylor, Cuerpo 660 E, Mantos 314, Breccia Chicotón, Cedritos, Cola 
de Gallo, Bonanza, La Piedra, Breccia San Javier, and San Francisco zone.  Most of these deposit areas 
remain opened for exploration and development; for instance, Breccia Milagros appears to represent a 
significant deposit which full extent is still unknown to FMS. 

Measured and indicated resources at La Encantada amount to 7.0 million tones at 173 g/tonne (5.6 oz) 
Ag and 1.73 percent (38.1 lb/tonne) Pb, for a total contained silver equivalent, inclusive of Pb credit, of 



Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 3.2 
80523  March 19, 2008

about 40.1 million ounces.  These resources include 4.9 million tonnes of tailings at an average grade of 
151 g/tonne (4.85 oz/tonne).  Preliminary testwork appears to indicate amenability and probable 
economic recovery of silver values from the tailings by Cyanide Leaching processing. Additional bulk 
testing is recommended to validate the resource.    

Additional inferred resources have been estimated by FMS at La Encantada Silver Mine.  The inferred 
resources require additional grade and tonnage information before they may be upgraded to indicated or 
measured resources.  They represent geologic potential to be further investigated.  La Encantada has 
estimated inferred resources that amount to about 2.0 million tonnes at an average grade of 200 g/tonne 
(6.3 oz/tonne) Ag and 0.50% (11 lb/tonne) Pb, for a total estimated content of silver equivalent, inclusive 
of Pb credit, of about 13.4 million ounces. 

Table 3-1 shows a summary of proven and probable reserves plus measured and indicated resources and 
inferred resources as of October 31, 2007. 

Processing flotation plant facilities have an installed capacity of 800 tonnes per day.  It includes all 
supporting facilities, including laboratory, maintenance, etc. The metallurgical plant is currently operating 
at about 700 tonnes per day. About half of the ore comes from the mine and the other half is from 
reprocessing waste dumps through a pre-screening process.  The mine/screened dumps ore processing 
rate is programmed to increase at a higher rate of mine ore for 2008.   

The surface rights to La Encantada mine are mostly owned by Minera La Encantada (a wholly owned 
subsidiary of FMS). According to La Encantada, there is a good working relationship with people of the 
Ejido Tenochtitlán from which the surface rights were purchased by La Encantada, and with the town of 
Múzquiz, since many of the inhabitants are employed in the exploration or mining operations.  No labor 
or access problems have been reported by La Encantada within the area. 

La Encantada Mine was declared in suspension of activities by Peñoles in 2003.  In April 24, 2007 La 
Encantada presented a notification of reactivation of operations at the mine to the National Water 
Commission (C.N.A.), to SEMARNAT, to Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social, and to PROFEPA. In 
accordance with legal opinion of November 22, 2007 by Mr. Carlos Galván Pastoriza, La Encantada mining 
operations are currently and have always been conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and 
regulations." 

PAH is not aware of any environmental liabilities in La Encantada mining district; most of the area 
covered by La Encantada concessions is mining and prospective land for mineral exploration and mine 
development.

PAH believes that La Encantada reserve and resource estimates have been reasonably prepared and 
conform to acceptable engineering standards for reporting of reserves and resources.  PAH believes that 
the classification of the reserves and resources meets the standards of Canadian National Instrument NI 
43-101 and the definitions of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM).

The reserves and resources herein reported by La Encantada were reviewed by PAH and constitute part 
of an operation by Minera La Encantada, a Mexican subsidiary of FMS.  There is no significant technical, 
legal, environmental, political or other kind of restrictions; therefore, in PAH's opinion, these reserves and 
resources may not be materially affected by issues that could prevent their extraction and processing. 

An economic analysis of La Encantada operation shows positive economics as measured by a cash flow 
model, and thus the postulated reserve position is accepted.  La Encantada Silver Mine shows a net 
present value of $6.5 million at a 10 percent discounted rate of return. 

Table 3-2 presents a summary of La Encantada cash flow based on current reserves/resources estimates.

8.0 HISTORY 

In 2003 Peñoles reported proven and probable reserves at the closing of La Encantada mine including 
485,000 tonnes at an average grade of 570 g/t Ag and 3.98 percent Pb.  FMS's exploration efforts are 
directed to explore other areas of interest within the extensive underground workings, validate these 
historical figures and advance development of additional exploration targets. By June 2007, FMS reported 
NI43-101 Proven and Probable Reserves of 633,000 tonnes at an average grade of 315 g/tonne Ag, in 
addition to Measured and Indicated Resources of 1.4 million tonnes at an average grade of 276 g/tonne 
Ag, and about 1.5 Million tonnes of Inferred Resources at an average grade of 200 g/tonne Ag, in 
Technical Report Amended of July 24, 2007 published in SEDAR.  The La Encantada aggressive 
exploration and development investments have resulted in additional Proven and Probable Reserves and 
Measured and Indicated Resources that contain over 250 percent more metals, silver and lead, than 
those previously reported. 

From the period of January to October, 2007 FMS has mined and processed 162,279 tonnes of ore from 
La Encantada Silver mine at an average recovered grade of 6.72 oz/tonne Ag, for a total of 1,090,515 
ounces. FMS mined 21,293 tonnes of ore from the May 31 proven and probable reserves, in addition of 
other minerals extracted from different areas of the mine during mine preparation and development 
activities, for a total of 162,279 tonnes.  Currently the plant has been stabilized at an operating rate of 
700 tonnes per day, while the mine continues to access, prepare new working phases and develop 
additional reserves and resources.

12.0 EXPLORATION 

12.1 Introduction

La Encantada Silver Mine has been subjected to exploration programs from its discovery in the 1950s, by 
prospectors in the early stages and by Peñoles since the late 1960s to 2003.  FMS is developing an 
aggressive program of explorations including mine development and preparations for drilling from 
underground sites. Additional diamond drilling is planned from surface locations, as well as geophysical 
surveying to investigate areas of interest and confirm other previously identified exploration areas.  

Exploration efforts carried out during the second half of 2007 were primarily focused in proving and 
developing additional Reserves and Resources for La Encantada mine.  These resulted in a significant 
increment of both Resources and Reserves.  Major efforts were developed in the areas of Breccia 
Milagros, Bonanza, San Francisco, Intrusivo Milagros, Azul y Oro, and Cuerpo de Zinc at mine level N-
1535 and in the sampling of the old dumps.  These results show an increment of about 575,600 tonnes in 
Proven and Probable Reserves and over 5.6 million tonnes in Measured and Indicated Resources over 
previously reported Reserves and Resources of May 31, 2007.  Additional efforts were carried out in 
drilling and metallurgical testwork of the old tailings dams that have resulted in a positive outcome for 
reprocessing, by Cyanide Leaching this material to recuperate some of the contained silver. 

Sampling of old dumps was also completed and over 100,000 tonnes of screened material were 
processed during the period.  Screening recovery of the dumps is about 40 percent in tonnage and grade 
enrichment from about 67 g/tonne Ag to about 130 g/tonne Ag (results for October 2007). 

Figure 12-1 shows the La Encantada Geologic Potential.  

12.2 Exploration Programs

FMS's program of underground exploration was designed to investigate the Milagros and San Javier 
breccia zones, as well as the San Francisco bedded deposits and the Bonanza area where numerous veins 
occur associated with the Bonanza dike.  The La Escalera breccia zone appears to be a significant target 
for exploration. 

During the period of June to October, 2007 a total of about 5,000 meters of underground workings for 
exploration purposes were developed at the La Encantada mine, including about 4,000 meters of access 
ramps, drifts, and crosscuts, and about 1,000 meters of exploration preparations for drill sites access.  
This development resulted in a significant increment of Resources and Reserves, about 5.6 million 
tonnes, at the various mine levels of the La Encantada Silver Mine, within the Breccia Milagros, Bonanza,  
San Francisco areas and in the two old tailings dams.

12.2.1 Geophysical Exploration 

FMS has designed an extensive 2008 program of exploration based on geophysical surveying to 
investigate the various identified anomaly areas, and to confirm other indicated potential zones. This 
program includes about 50 km of lines to be measured by Induced Polarization methods during the year.  
Some of the most outstanding targets for investigation are the La Escalera Breccia zone and the 
Anomalous areas "A", "B", "C" and "D". 

12.2.2 Geochemical Exploration 

No geochemical sampling has taken place at La Encantada during 2007; however, FMS has designed a 
2008 exploration program that includes sampling for geochemical investigations in the areas of La Prieta 
Sur, the upper part of the María Isabel area, and the Anomaly "D" zone. This program is estimated to 
include about 400 samples.

12.3 Drilling

Drilling programs at La Encantada have been limited since the best exploration results may have been 
obtained through underground development.  Additionally, topographic conditions at the mine and 
irregular morphology of mineral concentrations make it difficult to plan for drilling.  Therefore, drilling 
from underground sites and mine workings has proven to be the most effective combination for 
exploration at La Encantada. 

During 2007 the La Encantada exploration team initiated drilling from underground sites and completed 5 
drillholes totaling 565.6 meters to investigate continuity and depth of the San Francisco mineralized 
structures.  These drillholes resulted in extension and confirmation of some of San Francisco mineralized 
zones.

Additional drilling was developed at the old Peñoles tailings dams to determine volume and grade of the 
two tailings dams.  Metallurgical testwork was carried out in some of the drilled tailings.  Grade, tonnage 
and metallurgical recovery estimates have resulted in additional Resources for the La Encantada Silver 
Mine, since some of the silver contained by the tailings appears to be amenable for economic recovery by 
Cyanide Leaching processing methods.  The tailings drilling program included 15 drillholes totaling 168 
meters at the Tailings Dam No. 1, and 34 drillholes for a total drilled depth of 576 meters in Tailings Dam 
No. 2. 

Figure 12-3 is the La Encantada Tailings drill location map.

12.3.1 Exploration Drilling 

FMS exploration activities for La Encantada mine include acquisition of two drill rigs to initiate surface 
drilling programs, and continue with the planned drill program from underground sites. This program, 
scheduled for 2008, consists of a total underground development of 2,340m including drifts, crosscuts, 
raises, ramps and stopes development in addition to 5,000m of development carried out during the 
second semester of 2007. Numerous drill sites have been prepared during 2007 while expecting arrival of 
the drilling equipment. 

Details of the exploration program developed and completed during the second semester of 2007 are 
included in Table 12-1.  This program resulted in additional Resources and Reserves for the La Encantada 
mine.

Table 12-1 shows the exploration program completed for 2nd semester 2007.  

The FMS exploration program for La Encantada includes an aggressive underground and drilling plan that 
has a high probability of success given the geological conditions of the mineralization at the mine.  In 
PAH's opinion the combination of direct exploration methods, drilling and underground development 
represents a good balance for exploration at La Encantada.  The program is directed to access projected 
known areas of mineralization as well as to investigate other adjacent and new promising areas that may 
result in an increment of the Resource base and a higher level of Reserves for the mine. 

The exploration program suggested by FMS for the La Encantada Silver Mine for implementation during 
the period of calendar year 2008 is presented in Table 22-1 including estimated costs.  This program 
consists of 8,200 meters of surface drilling, 5,000 meters drilling from underground sites, and 2,340 
meters of underground drifting. 

In PAH's opinion, FMS's exploration program at La Encantada represents an aggressive exploration 
program with a high probability of success, which would lengthen the mine's life. PAH recommends 
implementation of the suggested program at an estimated cost of $2.4 million.

13.0 DRILLING 

FMS initiated drilling programs at La Encantada during the period from June to October, 2007.  FMS has 
acquired two additional drilling rigs to carry out exploration drilling from surface targets and from 
underground sites.  FMS's program for 2008 includes 8,200 meters of core drilling from surface to 
investigate the La Escalera breccia, Anomalies "A" and "B", La Prieta Sur, Mantos Guadalupe, María Isabel 
Alto, El Camello and El Bote zones.  Drilling from underground sites is programmed to investigate the 
Bonanza Dyke, Cedrito, San Francisco mineralized structures, Azul y Oro SW and other exploration 
targets at the 1940 and 1600 mine levels.  Exploration drilling requires access and drill sites preparation, 
which for the underground exploration is estimated to be approximately 2,400 meters of ramps, drifts, 
crosscuts and drill site construction.   

During the period of June through October, 2007, drilling at La Encantada included 51 drillholes for a 
total depth of 744 meters, including two holes that were developed out of the tailings dams, to determine 
volume and grade of two tailings dams.  This program resulted in an estimated tonnage of 4.9 million 
tonnes of tailings at an average grade of 151 g/tonne (4.9 oz/tonne) Ag.  

Five drillholes were completed from underground access to investigate the San Francisco mineralized 
structures.  Total drilled depth was 565.6 meters.  Some of the San Francisco mineralized structures were 
intersected to confirm geologic continuity of the mineralization.  Additional Resources and some Reserve 
blocks were confirmed by the program. 

Details of FMS's 2008 drilling program are presented in Table 22-1 including estimated costs. 

Exploration drilling targets for surface drilling include: 

� Breccia La Escalera 
� Anomaly A 
� Anomaly B 
� Anomaly C 
� Anomaly D 

Exploration drilling from underground drill sites includes: 

� Bonanza Dike 
� Cedrito
� Azul y Oro 
� Breccia La Escalera at Level 790, and 
� Anomaly B

PAH believes that this drilling program from surface and underground workings, in combination with 
underground development, is appropriate and well designed to explore promising targets.  Geologic 
potential exists to discover additional mineralized zones along the development workings.  Estimated 
budget for this program is included in Section 22 of this Report - Recommendations.

14.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

PAH reviewed La Encantada's sampling program for the preparation of the Technical Report Amended 
dated July 24, 2007.  Full description of sampling method and approach by La Encantada's geologic crews 
is presented in the Technical Report Amended July 24, 2007.  Additionally, PAH also reviewed the La 
Encantada sampling procedures for this Technical Report and did not notice changes in protocols that 
may affect the results, other than improving in some areas, such as QA / QC with increasing number of 
filed duplicates for drilling and reserve blocks samples. 

The samples are brought into the La Encantada laboratory for preparation and assaying. Duplicate 
samples are sent to Inspectorate Lab for assay checks. 

In PAH's opinion, the channel sampling and methods applied by La Encantada exploration and mining 
crews is done carefully and responsibility by well trained samplers. The sampling appears to reconcile 
with silver / lead head assays for the processing plant, as well as with production and sales by Minera La 
Encantada.  The channel samples appear to properly represent the mineralization of La Encantada 
deposits, therefore, they are acceptable for resource and reserve estimates.

15.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

15.1 Sample Preparation 

Channel, exploration, mine development and production, and plant samples are sent to La Encantada's 
on-site laboratories for chemical analysis of silver, lead, iron, zinc and manganese. Silver assays are 
carried out by fire assaying methods, while the rest of the elements are assayed by atomic absorption 
(AA).  A typical channel sample received by the laboratory, weighing approximately 4 kilograms, is passed 
through a jaw crusher to reduce it to a 1.3-centimeter (1/2") size.  A 500-gram split is taken and passed 
through gyratory or disk crushers to reduce it to a 10-mesh (1/8") size.  A 200 to 300 gram split is taken 
and placed in a drying oven at 120 degrees Centigrade.  After drying, the material is put into two 
pulverizers, one disk pulverizer and one ring pulverizer, to grind the rock to minus 100 mesh. The 
resulting pulp is homogenized and 10 grams taken for fire assay analysis of silver and gold for geology 
samples and for concentrates; 20 grams for head samples; and 1 gram for precipitate samples. 

The 10 gram pulps are placed in fusion crucibles and placed into an electric furnace for fusion into lead 
buttons. The lead buttons are placed in cupels into an electric furnace for cupellation into a silver-gold 
bead.  The bead is weighed and then put into nitric acid to dissolve away the silver and then the 
remaining gold bead is weighed again. The microbalance used has a sensitivity of  + 1  per 10,000 
(equivalent to an actual grade of  +0.1 gram per tonne), while the gold beads commonly range in weight 
from 100 milligrams down to less than 1 milligram.  As a result, the determination of the smaller bead 
weight is at or below the detection limits of the microbalance. 

15.2 Laboratory Facilities 

PAH notes that the La Encantada laboratories generally appear to be adequate, with reasonable cleaning 
and organization.  The laboratory currently conducts about 800 samples by fire assay and AA per month, 
including exploration samples, development samples, and mill samples. 

More details on laboratory facilities are presented in Technical Report Amended of July 24, 2007. 

FMS's procedure for quality controls is by sending drill core, mine samples and/or pulps to an outside 
laboratory, usually Inspectorate Labs in Reno, Nevada.  Samples of concentrates are regularly sent to 
Peñoles for check assays.  The laboratory duplicates pulp assays at 1 sample for every 10 and it includes 
field duplicates, standard samples and introduction of blank samples.  

15.3 Check Assaying 

To evaluate sample quality control, the La Encantada personnel perform periodic check analyses on 
samples. For the operating period from June to October 31, 2007, La Encantada has sent 96 samples to 
Inspectorate Laboratories, an independent commercial laboratory in Reno, Nevada for duplicate analysis.  
These include 22 samples from reserve blocks in addition to 22 more duplicates of pulps from the reserve 



Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 15.2 
80523  March 19, 2008

blocks.  La Encantada has also sent 35 duplicate samples and 17 pulp samples from the drillholes carried 
out in the tailings deposits. Results of the assays and graphs are presented in the following Tables and 
graphs.  La Encantada Silver Mine is mining and processing mineralization contained in oxides, which 
presents highly variable metal concentrations due to its inherent genetic characteristics.  In this type of 
mineral occurrence, the comparison of assays may present high variations, depending on the mineral 
content of each sample.  High grade silver assays may present differences of up to 60 percent, while the 
middle range grade samples usually result in close assays.  In overall comparison, however, within a 
range of assays that represent very low to very high grades, the correlation is generally acceptable. 

Tables 15-1 and 15-2, and Figures 15-1 and 15-2 show the assay results and graphs for samples of the 
La Encantada reserve blocks as duplicate samples and as duplicate pulp samples.  The comparison is 
between assays by the La Encantada mine's lab and Inspectorate Laboratories.

The reserve duplicate samples mineral content range includes assays that vary from 0 to 1,160 g/tonne 
Ag.  The average correlation coefficient of the silver grades is acceptable for the set of samples, at 83 
percent, although the difference shows slightly higher assays by the La Encantada lab.  The reserve pulp 
duplicate samples, for the same set of duplicate samples, range in silver values from 0 to 1,160 g/tonne 
Ag with a general correlation of 100 percent and closed assays between both labs.  Therefore, major 
differences may result during the sample preparation process.   PAH believes that the reproducibility of 
silver grades is reasonable, within acceptable industry practices.  

La Encantada Silver Mine drilled a total of 49 drillholes within the old tailings dams, No. 1 and No. 2 of 
Peñoles' historic operation.  La Encantada duplicated 35 samples of tailings core and 17 pulp tailings 
samples. The results are presented in Tables 15-3 and 15-4 and represented by graphs in figures 15-3 
and 15-4. The range of silver assays is from 30 g/tonne Ag to 310 g/tonne Ag and the resulting 
correlation is 76 percent.  The pulp duplicate samples resulted in a correlation of 98 percent for a range 
of assays between 10 g/tonne Ag and 310 g/tonne Ag. Both sets of samples include different samples.

La Encantada Silver Mine has implemented a strict program of Quality Control by introduction of blank 
and standard samples, as well as the insertion of field duplicate samples and pulp duplicates to keep a 
close control of the assay results. PAH recommends taking special care during the sample preparation 
process, which shows higher differences in assay checks. 

15.4 Conclusion

Overall, PAH found that the results from the check assaying are reasonable.  It is PAH's opinion that the 
sample methods and analyses are representative of the deposits at La Encantada mine, and that most of 
La Encantada's data was generated by procedures that were carried out according to accepted industry 
standards using accepted practices. 

PAH finds that the exploration, sampling, and laboratory analysis for La Encantada operation is being 
conducted by FMS in a reasonable manner consistent with standard industry practices.  PAH would 
expect the sampling results to be reasonably representative of the deposits mineralization and believes 
that they may be used with acceptable confidence in the estimation of the mineable reserves.

16.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

PAH has not taken independent samples from the surface or underground exposures of the mineral 
concentrations at La Encantada mine, as other Qualified Persons have previously sampled the 
mineralization as discussed in this report, and the production records are the most reliable data of 
mineralization contained in the ore deposits under development at the mine.  Peñoles developed and 
operated La Encantada mine for over 25 years producing over 80 million ounces of silver.  Peñoles is one 
of the leading Mexican mining companies and the world's largest silver producer.  

FMS has established in a short operating period a systematic procedure to verify data and quality control 
which is proving effective and accurate.  Assay data and information generated by the operation is 
transmitted manually; however, the entire paper trail is accessible and available for inspection. 

FMS initiated an effective control of La Encantada operations since November 2006 when it took control 
of the mining operation.  La Encantada has established an active program of assay checks for samples 
and pulps of exploration, production and concentrates at the mine's lab in comparison to assays 
performed by Inspectorate Laboratories of Durango city and Reno, Nevada, and concentrate sampling 
and assaying program by a sales representative in the city of Torreón, Coahuila to check the assays 
reported by the MET-MEX Peñoles smelter. 

Table 16-1 presents a summary of concentrate assays for August, 2007 of shipments to MET-MEX 
Peñoles.  This summary presents a comparison of assays by La Encantada lab and Peñoles. 

The coefficient of correlation is excellent for all determinations, including weight (99.9 percent), silver 
(97.5 percent), and lead (93 percent).  

Figure 16-1 shows correlation between silver assays of both laboratories.  

PAH believes that an adequate amount of checking has been conducted and that the results are 
representative of the mineralization and concentrates produced at La Encantada and shipped to the 
smelter. 

PAH's conclusion is that the results from check assaying are reasonable, including appropriate preparation 
procedures; that the sampling results appear to be reasonably representative of the deposit 
mineralization and concentrates, and should be usable with acceptable confidence in the estimation of 
the mineable reserves.

17.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

No adjacent properties exist within the surrounding area of La Encantada.  The El Plomo mine was 
operated as an independent mine for a period of time during the early stages of La Encantada 
development; however, around 1983 it was purchased by Minera La Encantada and it has been part of La 
Encantada mine since then.  Underground developments of La Encantada and El Plomo were connected 
and established as one underground system.  No other mine exists nearby the La Encantada area. 

La Encantada mine is located at about 100km from the cities of Ocampo and Músquiz, in Coahuila, 
Mexico.   

La Encantada mine housing facilities include 180 single family houses, events center, hotel and three 
restaurants, sport facilities for soccer, squash and bowling, apart from the administration offices and 
warehouses, etc. Refurbishing of required facilities is in progress. 

FMS has consolidated ownership of the La Encantada mine area by acquiring all mining claims and 
concessions around the property.  Surface rights have also been acquired by La Encantada from the local 
"Ejido" (land community) under expropriation proceedings in accordance with the Mining Laws.

18.0 METALLURGICAL TESTING AND MINERAL PROCESSING 

The ore processed at La Encantada is a complex mixture of oxide and sulfide minerals and is 
consequently difficult to process efficiently.  The principal economic minerals are as follows: 

� Argentite (Ag2S)
� Acanthite (Ag2S)
� Cerrussite (PbCO3)

The gangue is principally limestone and hematite with minor amounts of quartz, manganese, zinc, and 
tin.

The ore is relatively soft and friable making for easy crushing and grinding.  The ore processing method 
consists of crushing and grinding followed by two sequential flotation steps, the first consists of sulfide 
mineral flotation and the second is oxide mineral flotation.  The reason for floating the ore in two stages 
is because the reagents used for oxide flotation are detrimental to sulfide flotation.  Recoveries are poor, 
a reflection of the difficult mineralogy of the rock; operating costs are modest, a consequence of the 
softness of the rock.       

Metallurgical testwork is in progress in the following two areas: 

� Flotation of current and future ore: the results are about the same as that of the plant. 

� Cyanide leaching of the flotation tails, both old and new material: preliminary silver recovery after 
cyanidation is about 48 percent. Bulk testing is anticipated to take place at FMS's La Parrilla Silver 
Mine in Durango. 

Figure 18-1 shows the sulfidation of oxides in flotation concentrates.

19.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

La Encantada uses conventional, manual methods, assisted by computer databases, to calculate the 
tonnage and average grades of the mineral Resources and Reserves.  FMS has initiated the compilation 
of all data to incorporate it into a database and create a geologic model in SURPAC software which has 
been acquired by the company.   FMS has reviewed and calculated Resources and Reserves for La 
Encantada to assess the current status of the property and to use it as a basis for future updated 
estimates.  FMS assumed control of La Encantada Silver Mine operation from November 2006.  FMS 
estimated the first Resource / Reserve base for the La Encantada mine as of May 31, 2007. This estimate 
is an update of May 31, 2007 Resource / Reserve base and it incorporates exploration and underground 
development results for the mine.  During the current period La Encantada mined a total of 162,279 
tonnes of ore, from which only 21,293 tonnes were mined out of the previously reported Reserves and 
also increased the Reserves during the period by about 575,600 tonnes.  This Resource / Reserve update 
calculation has been estimated as of October 31, 2007. 

19.1 Introduction 

FMS estimated proven and probable Reserves, as of May 31, 2007 amounted to 633,506 tonnes at an 
average grade of 403 g/tonne Ag and 1.93 percent Pb.  Cutoff grade was estimated as 271 g/tonne Ag 
only, and 262 g/tonne Ah equivalent net of Pb credit.  The estimated Reserves were included in the 
deposits of: Breccia Milagros, Azul y Oro, Breccia Keylor, Cuerpo 660, Mantos 314, Chicotón Stope, 
Cedritos and Cola Gallo deposits. 

FMS has implemented exploration programs based on drifting, drilling and channel sampling.  During this 
reported period, May through October 2007, FMS has increased the silver contained in the Resource / 
Reserve base for the La Encantada mine by about 250 percent including Proven and Probable Reserves 
and Measured and Indicated resources.  Additional inferred resources have been delineated and other 
exploration targets are under further investigations.  Additional resources and reserves were developed 
within the La Encantada mine in the Breccia Milagros, Bonanza, San Francisco, La Piedra deposits.  Dump 
materials and tailings dams have been sampled and measured resulting in additional Reserves and 
Resources for the La Encantada mine. 

19.2 Methodology 

Under the La Encantada mine's diverse geologic environment, the Resource and Reserve blocks have 
been defined at the various drift levels where sampling has found mineable ore within the mineralized 
zones.  The Reserve tonnage and grade are based largely on channel samples along drifts, crosscuts and 
other mine workings.  Drilling from underground sites was initiated to explore the San Francisco 
mineralized structures to depth.  This program was completed with five drillholes and a total depth of 565 
meters. FMS's surface drilling program has been on hold due to delay in delivery of drilling equipment for 
development of an extensive exploration program. Reserve and Resource blocks range in length 
according to variable extensions of breccia or mineralized zones, and are from 50 to 150 meters in length 



Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 19.2 
80523  March 19, 2008

along the mineralized structures.  The Resource and Reserve blocks are developed by drifting across 
breccia zones and structures. Proven Reserve blocks are projected up to 15 meters from the drift in 
which the channel samples were taken, and Probable blocks extending another 15 meters beyond the 
Proven blocks. 

All adits, drifts ramps and access development headings are regularly surveyed by La Encantada staff.  
The mineralized zones are subdivided into vertical sections through the multiple horizontal levels, such 
that each vertical section has 10 meter horizontal separation from the immediately adjacent sections.  For 
Reserve estimation, the cross sectional area of mineralization is drawn on each of these 10-meter spaced 
sections using Auto CAD software and the assayed sample lengths.  The volume of mineralization on 
each section is calculated for the mineralized zone extending 5 meters on either side of the section.  The 
density factor (specific gravity) is then input into the calculation, and tonnage is calculated based on the 
formula; Length (in meters) X Width (in meters) X Height (in meters) X Specific Gravity = tonnes of 
material. 

The density factor used to convert Reserve block volumes into tonnes has been determined as a 
weighted average from ore samples representative of the various deposit areas. The density tests were 
performed by Peñoles and by FMS. Numerous samples have been sent to an external lab (Inspectorate 
Lab) for determination.  Breccia Milagros samples density determinations have reported an average of 
2.85.  La Encantada continues to follow a conservative approach by taking an average density of 2.70. 

Figure 19–1 shows the density determinations Breccia Milagros samples.  

PAH believes that, on average, the density for mineralization is reasonable.  PAH recommends that 
additional representative samples be taken periodically, as checks for bulk density determination, to 
ensure and properly adjust the application of an appropriate density factor as required.  

To estimate the average grade and thickness for each 10-meter section that crosses a Reserve block, La 
Encantada composites all the sample grades in the drift that occur within 5 meters on either side of the 
section.  La Encantada has determined that the most appropriate filter for grade outliers is to assign a 
top grade of 1,000 g/tonne Ag to those samples.  The total length of samples in the composite is then 
divided by the total number of composites, giving the average width of the mineralization in the drift at 
that section.  Similarly, the average silver grade of the samples, weighted by length, gives the average 
silver grade for the drift at that section. 

The tonnes and grade for each Reserve block are then determined by combining the tonnes and grade 
results obtained for each 10-meter section that crosses the block.  The Resource block tonnes and grade 
are tabulated by La Encantada personnel on a series of spreadsheet summaries. 

PAH notes that the sampling conducted across the mineralized zones for use in the Reserve estimates is 
done with cut-off grade and width considerations, at a minimum mining width of 2.00m.  This minimum 
width typically includes zones within the structures that are above the cutoff grade, as well as sub-ore  





Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 19.4 
80523  March 19, 2008

grade mineralization below the cutoff grade, in which case La Encantada eliminates these areas when 
possible.

PAH also notes that in a few local areas, the drift is wholly enclosed by the mineralized structures and, 
unless there are some additional crosscuts or drilling, the vein width is taken as that measured across the 
confines of the drift opening.  PAH recommends that the true structure widths, measured by cross cuts 
and/or the drill holes, be used as much as possible in the blocks of Reserve and Resource estimation.  

The Reserve blocks estimated by La Encantada are not included within the Resource blocks. 

In PAH's opinion the Reserve and Resource block estimates carried out by La Encantada have been 
reasonably prepared and conform to acceptable engineering standards for reporting of Reserves. 

19.3 Cutoff Grade Calculations 

For the current Reserve, PAH has calculated breakeven cutoff grades for both the underground mine 
operations and also the dump recovery program.  The basic parameters applicable to the cutoff grade 
calculations for the underground mine are shown in the following table: 

Equating these parameters (U/G mine only), the breakeven cutoff grade for silver (CAg), based solely on 
silver for total operating costs (Table 25-7) and process recoveries anticipated is as follows: 

CMAg =Total operating costs/ (Silver price X mill recovery X smelter payable metal) 

CMAg= $53.33 per tonne/($10.50 X 0.65 X 0.95) =8.23 oz Ag per tonne or 256 g Ag/tonne.

However, there is a small lead contribution for La Encantada ores. Production of lead in the concentrates 
from the mine for all of 2007 is about 320 tonnes.  The calculation for lead contribution is as follows: 

Revenues for Mine from lead (Rm) = Lbs lead in concentrates X payable from smelter X lead price. 

Rm =320 t X 2204 lbs/t  X 0.95  X $0.68 

Rm = $455,735 

Rm/ tonne mined = $455,735 / 92,993 = $4.90/ tonne. 

The silver equivalent of lead contribution = $4.90 /$10.50 = 0.47 oz Ag/tonne or 15 g Ag/tonne. 

The adjusted mine cutoff grade (CMAg) is then:256 269 g Ag/tonne Ag-15 g Ag/tonne = 241 g 
Ag/tonne.

The basic parameters used for the cutoff grade calculations for the recovery of dump material are shown 
in the following Table 19-2. 

Equating these parameters (dumps only), the breakeven cutoff grade for mining and processing of the 
"in-situ" dumps, based solely on silver for the total operating costs (Table 25-8) and process recoveries 
anticipated, is as follows: 

CDAg = Total Operating Costs/ (silver price X mill recovery X smelter payable metal). 

CDAg = $17.13/ $10.50 X 0.547 X 0.95) = 3.14 oz Ag/tonne or 98 g Ag/tonne.

A lead contribution is also applicable for recovery of dump material.  About 106.9 tonnes of lead in 
concentrates will be produced through October 31, 2007.  The calculation for the lead contribution is as 
follows:

Revenues for lead from Dumps (Rd)= Lbs in concentrates X payable from smelter X lead price. 

Rd = 106.9 tonnes X 2204 lbs/t X 0.95 X $0.68 

Rd = $152,244 or $152,200 

Rd per tonne of dumps processed = $152,200/69,300 = $2.20/tonne. 

Ag Equivalent per tonne = Rd/ Ag price = $2.20/$10.50 = 0.21 oz Ag/tonne or 7 g Ag/tonne. 

Adjusted Cut-off Grade (CDAg) for dumps = 98g Ag/tonne – 7g Ag/tonne = 91 g Ag/tonne

19.4 Reserve Estimates 

PAH has reviewed La Encantada Reserve update of October 31, 2007 along with factors for mining 
dilution and recovery.  In addition, the sampling methods, assaying procedures, compositing methods, 
data handling, cutoff grade application and grade calculations were reviewed.  Several Reserve blocks 
were cross-checked to track data handling from the initial assays to the final tonnage and grade 
calculation to ensure that the stated methods and practices were observed. 

La Encantada has estimated mineable Reserves for the following deposits: 

� Breccia Milagros 
� Azul y Oro 
� Breccia Keylor 
� Cuerpo 660 
� Mantos 314 
� Breccia Chicotón 
� Cedritos
� Cola Gallo 
� Bonanza
� San Francisco 
� La Piedra, and 
� Stockpiles at the mine and at the plant patios. 

The total "in-situ" diluted Reserve at a minimum mining width of 2.00m, as reviewed by PAH, is 1.209 
million tonnes averaging 312 grams (10.03 oz) per tonne silver and 1.77 percent (39 lb/tonne) lead, for a 
total of 12.6 million contained ounces of silver net of lead credit.  As discussed previously in the 



Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 19.7 
80523  March 19, 2008

calculation methodology section, the proven ore category has been projected up to 15 meters from the 
drift sample data, while the probable ore category is projected another 15 meters beyond the proven ore. 

La Encantada has been processing pre-screened dump materials.  Results for the month of October 2007 
indicate that screened dumps yield about 40 percent of tonnage with increased silver grade from about 
67 g/tonne to about 131 g/tonne; therefore, the dump materials have been included as an Indicated 
Resource due to silver content of an average grade below the cutoff grade.  Estimated recovered 
screened tonnage from the measured dumps is about 225,000 tonnes. 

Table 19-3 presents a summary of La Encantada Proven and Probable Reserves. 

Figures 19-2 to 19-5 show cross sections and plan view of some of the different Reserve and Resource 
areas at La Encantada Silver Mine. 

La Encantada deposits occur in breccia zones and faults or fracturing intersections that make wide and 
irregular deposits.  These generally present widths greater than 2.00m which is estimated to be the 
minimum mining width due to the mining equipment in use at the mine. Therefore, mining dilution is only 
significant when the mining is developed along narrow structures.  Provisions have been taken to include 
the mining dilution for those areas.

19.5 Resource Estimation 

Resource calculations by FMS at La Encantada are based on projections of the mineralized zones in the 
underground mine workings; 10m to 15m beyond the areas of Reserves for the Measured Resources; and 
another 15m beyond the boundaries of the Measured Resources for the blocks of Indicated Resources. 
Inferred Resources are estimated by projecting up to 50m beyond the Indicated Resource block 
boundaries along mineralized structures, and another 15m beyond the blocks' width.  The estimated 
Resource blocks may be limited by underground levels and previous mining extraction.  Longitudinal 
projections depend on the drift development along the mineralized zones and it may vary from about 
50m up to 150m in length. 

La Encantada mineral Resource estimates were applied only to adjacent blocks from the estimated 
Reserves.  Resource estimates were made for blocks that include only oxidized mineralization, such as 
the Breccia Keylor, Azul y Oro, Breccia Milagros, Cuerpo 660, Cuerpo 660 W and San Francisco deposits.  
Sulfides mineralization is only estimated in the La Morena deposit.  Sulfides are only considered as 
Resources because the processing facilities for the zinc circuit at the plant are not currently operating.  

The grade for these blocks is determined from the grade estimated for the adjacent Reserve blocks, and 
sampling in mine workings and drill holes located within the block area. 

Geologic potential still exists within the mine's area to investigate targets that may result in additional 
resource development for La Encantada.  Exploration and full development of breccia zones, such as: 
Milagros, San Javier, Keylor, San Francisco and Azul y Oro may result in high-tonnage resource 
development.  The Breccia Milagros appears to be a significant deposit.  Other areas that appear to 
represent important targets for exploration are breccia La Escalera and the area west of the La Prieta 
deposit beyond the María Isabel fault.  This area appears to be downthrown to the west of La Prieta 
deposit, which represents the largest known deposit within La Encantada area.   

In addition to the Reserves, La Encantada has estimated resources in blocks within the following areas: 

� Breccia Milagros 
� Azul y Oro area 
� Breccia Keylor 
� Cuerpo 660 E and W 
� Bonanza
� Cuerpo de Zinc, N-1535 
� Intrusivo Milagros 
� San Francisco 
� Mine dumps 
� Tailings Dam No. 1 
� Tailings Dam No. 2, and 
� Sulfides deposits at the Cuerpo 660 area. 



Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 19.13 
80523  March 19, 2008

Additional Inferred Resources have been projected in the Azul y Oro, Breccia San Javier, Bonanza, 
Intrusivo Milagros and San Francisco zones. 

FMS has developed a drilling program to measure and sample the tailings dams; preliminary testwork has 
been performed in some representative samples which indicate potentially economic recovery of some of 
the silver values contained by the tailings.  Processing would be by Cyanide Leaching.  

La Encantada's estimate of Measured and Indicated Resource blocks as reviewed by PAH, is shown in 
Table 19-4.  The Measured and Indicated silver Resources consist of 7.0 million tonnes averaging 173 
grams (5.6 oz) per tonne silver, for a total content of 40.1 million ounces of silver equivalent. This 
resources grade has been estimated "in situ", and the silver equivalent content is net of lead credit, at 15 
g/tonne Ag.  The tailings dams No.1 and No.2 and dumps material have been included as Indicated 
Resources.  This estimate is based on the following prices: Ag - $10.50/oz and Pb - $0.68 / lb. 

Table 19-4 is the Measured and Indicated Resource Estimate for La Encantada.  PAH notes that these 
Resources are in addition to the previously reported Reserves. 

La Encantada has estimated additional silver Resources at a distance beyond the Proven and Probable 
Reserves.  These additional Resources lack sufficient drifting, raising, sampling, drill holes or old workings 
with production data, and are estimated at a lower degree of confidence than other Reserve or Resource 
categories.  PAH considers these additional Resources to be of an inferred category and they are based 
on projections of presumed vein continuity ahead, above, and below current mining; and are based on 
very widely-spaced drill holes, surface sampling or old surface workings.  These Resources are presented 
by La Encantada as Inferred Resources. 

The Inferred Resources need considerable grade and tonnage information before they can be "proved 
up" to "Mineable Reserves."  To date, La Encantada has demonstrated a continuity along about 4.0 
kilometers of strike length and down dip to about 700 meters; so it is reasonable to assume that in the 
future Resources will continue to be converted to ore as additional drifting, crosscutting and raising 
define vein configurations, sampling and assaying determine the grade, and diamond drilling confirms 
vein extensions and fills in data gaps.  Inferred Resources for La Encantada are presented in the lower 
portion of Table 19-4.

19.6 Conclusion 

PAH believes that these Reserve and Resource estimates have been reasonably prepared and conform to 
acceptable engineering standards for reporting of Resources.  PAH believes that the classification of the 
Reserves and Resources meets the standards of Canadian National Instrument NI 43-101 and the 
definitions of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM). 

The Reserves and Resources herein reported by La Encantada Silver Mine were reviewed by PAH and 
constitute part of an operation by Minera La Encantada, a Mexican subsidiary of FMS.  There are no 
significant technical, legal, environmental, political or other kind of restrictions; therefore, in PAH's 
opinion these Reserves and Resources may not be materially affected by issues that could prevent their 
extraction and processing.

20.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

La Encantada mine has been in operation for over 25 years.  Reported silver production for that period by 
Peñoles is about 80 million ounces of silver, in addition to significant lead content and minor gold.  This 
production was extracted from about 6 Million tonnes of ore. 

Historical mineral concentrations at La Encantada consist of mineralized breccia pipes (chimneys) and 
metasomatic zones, which typically contain up to 2.0 million tonnes; breccia zones that range up to 1.0 
million tonnes; vein deposits that may contain up to 0.5 million tonnes, and mantos or bedded deposits 
that may hold up to 50,000 tonnes of usually high grade concentrations. 

Major underground workings were developed by Peñoles at La Encantada, to connect the various parts of 
the mine, as well as to explore and mine mineralized zones within the Aurora limestone / dolomite 
formation.  These workings extend along a 4km-long mineralized structural zone, with access to mine 
levels at elevations of 1,535m to about 2,300m.  These connections are accessible by shafts and ramps. 

Through the underground development, numerous exploration targets have been projected, identified or 
discovered. 

At the closure of La Encantada mine by Peñoles in June 2002, several exploration targets remained to be 
investigated. Some of these areas require significant development as well as drilling from underground 
locations, such as Breccia Milagros, Breccia San Javier, Bonanza zone, Mantos San Francisco, etc.  Other 
longer-term exploration targets may result in discoveries which may be as significant as those previously 
mined such as La Prieta and La Escondida, these areas are La Escalera, Ojuela and Cuerpo 660. 

Other important areas for future development by FMS are represented by primary sulfide mineralization 
located at depth, in proximity to the granodiorite intrusive stocks, such as Cuerpo La Morena, Cuerpos 
660 E and W, and Ojuela, which may enhance and extend La Encantada mine life. 

La Encantada exploration investigations have resulted in validation and a significant increment of previous 
Reserve and Resource estimates.  Proven and Probable Reserve estimates as of October 31, 2007 are 
about 70 percent higher than the Reserves estimated for May 31, 2007, while Measured and Indicated 
Resources were augmented nearly 500 percent, including tailings from previous Peñoles operations, 
which have been tested for processing by cyanidation.  Inferred Resources are also increased by about 
30 percent.  Numerous additional exploration targets have been identified by La Encantada staff.   

In PAH's opinion, La Encantada has developed a highly successful exploration program based on 
underground development and drilling which has resulted in increasing Resources and Reserves and 
identifying other exploration targets; therefore La Encantada investments in exploration and development 
have been well justified.

21.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Recorded production in about 25 years by Minera La Encantada, S.A. de C.V. is approximately 6.0 million 
tonnes of ore at an average grade of Ag-418 g/t (13.44 oz/t) and Pb-9.83 percent (over 80 million 
ounces of silver and about 1.3 billion lbs of lead) until June 2002 when Peñoles shut the operation down.  
Mining and processing by FMS through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Desmín and Minera La Encantada, 
is approximately 175,000 tonnes of ore to October 31, 2007.  

Mineralization at La Encantada is a typical assemblage of metasomatic deposits with a high content of 
silver and lead.  This mineral assemblage has been affected by a long process of oxidation and secondary 
enrichment.  The most important mineralization consists of unconsolidated massive concentrations of 
oxides including hematite, limonite and other iron oxides as well as carbonates and sulphates, including 
the minor presence of zinc oxides.  Silver and lead represent the main economic minerals within the 
oxidized deposits at La Encantada.  Silver mineralization occurs as argentite and native silver.  Lead 
mineralization is present as carbonates (cerussite) and sulfates (anglesite) and other oxides. 

La Encantada mineral assemblage occurs within a range of about 435m in vertical extension (2035m to 
1600m asl).  Below the 1600m elevation, at the La Morena deposit in the SW portion of La Encantada 
area, primary sulfide mineralization has been identified.  This mineralization includes primarily sphalerite, 
galena and pyrite.  FMS has identified other regional areas of geologic interest.  These areas appear to 
represent potential exploration targets that may extend the mineralized system.  

FMS initiated preliminary drilling, during the period of June through October, 2007 while expecting new 
drill rigs to carry out a more comprehensive drilling program to investigate several targets.  Exploration 
investigations during this period by La Encantada staff have resulted in about 6.2 million tonnes of 
additional Reserve and Resource blocks within the mining areas.  These include dumps materials and 
tailings being investigated by FMS as Resources. 

The mine was initially developed from the shafts as a conventional operation with rail haulage levels, and 
utilizing standard rail-bound loading and hauling equipment.  Subsequently, La Encantada Mine has been 
converted to a mainly trackless operation, although rail haulage is still used on a few of the deeper levels 
of the mine.  

The main access to the current mine operations is a trackless adit at the 1,870 elevation.  This working 
has been enlarged to accommodate 20-t capacity highway-type dump trucks for ore and waste haulage 
from the mine.  Drifts and ramps are driven with cross-sectional area of about 3- X 3- meters, and the 
enlarged drifts and ramps to accommodate the larger dump trucks are about 4.5- X 5.0- meters in cross-
section.  Most areas of the mine are unsupported, but in a few places, rock bolts and wire mesh has been 
installed, and in other heavy ground areas, it has been necessary to install steel arches with timber 
lagging.



Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 21.2

A ramp system in the interior of the mine provides access for low-profile diesel mobile equipment up to 
the 2035 level and down to the 1710 level. The portion of the ramp above the 1870 level is being 
enlarged to accommodate the highway-type dump trucks. Mining operations at La Encantada mine are 
partially mechanized.  Drilling of headings for both development and stoping is accomplished using 
pneumatic hand-held jackleg machines.  Loading and tramming is done with diesel-powered, low profile 
front-end loaders (load-haul-dumps, or LHD's), and haulage is usually with highway-type diesel rear-
dump trucks, or battery powered rail haulage trains.   

The ore processed at La Encantada is a complex mixture of oxide and sulfide minerals and is 
consequently difficult to process efficiently.  The principal economic minerals are as follows: 

� Argentite (Ag2S)
� Acanthite (Ag2S)
� Cerrussite (PbCO3)

The ore is relatively soft and friable, which is easily crushed and milled.  The ore processing method 
consists of crushing and grinding followed by two sequential flotation steps.  The first consists of sulfide 
mineral flotation and the second is oxide mineral flotation.   

Installed capacity at La Encantada is 800 tpd; however, it is currently operated at about 700 tpd. 

Recoveries are modest, a reflection of the difficult mineralogy of the rock; operating costs are modest, a 
consequence of the softness of the rock.  As a result of the modest recoveries, some of La Encantada 
tailings may be amenable to re-processing by different metallurgical methods such as cyanidation.  

Peñoles estimated proven and probable reserves as of December 2002 amounted to 484,857 tonnes at 
an average grade of 570 g/t Ag and 3.98 percent Pb.  No cutoff grade was reported.  The estimated 
reserves were included in the deposits of: Bonanza, El Milagro, Estructuras Irregulares Bonanza, 
Estructuras Irregulares San Javier, Breccia San Javier, Ojuelas, San Francisco, and Azul y Oro deposits. 

FMS has initiated exploration programs based on drifting, channel sampling, drilling, geophysical 
investigations and some geochemical studies.  Peñoles reported (2002) reserve or resource blocks are a 
primary target for confirmation, validation and further exploration by FMS, as well as other promising 
areas of reserves. 

PAH has reviewed La Encantada Reserve update of October 31, 2007, along with factors for mining 
dilution and recovery.  In addition, the sampling methods, assaying procedures, compositing methods, 
data handling, cutoff grade application and grade calculations were reviewed.  Several Reserve blocks 
were cross-checked to track data handling from the initial assays to the final tonnage and grade 
calculation to ensure that the stated methods and practices were observed.

The total "in-situ" diluted Reserve as of October 31, 2007, at a minimum mining width of 2.00m, as 
reviewed by PAH, is 1.2 million tonnes averaging 312 grams (10.03 oz) per tonne silver and 1.77 percent 
(39 lb/tonne) lead, for a total of 12.6 million contained ounces of silver net of lead credit.  

In addition to Reserves, the La Encantada holds Measured and Indicated mineral Resources that include 
estimates for the following areas: Azul y Oro, Breccia Milagros, Cuerpo 660, Cuerpo 660 W and Breccia 
Keylor deposits.  Sulfide mineralization is only estimated in the La Morena deposit.  Sulfides are only 
considered as Resources because the processing facilities for the zinc circuit at the plant are currently out 
of order.  Old tailings deposits from previous operations have been drilled, measured and sampled, and 
further investigation and testing to confirm metallurgical recoveries is now underway.  The tailings appear 
to be amenable for reprocessing by cyanidation; therefore they have been included as Indicated 
Resources.  Dump materials have been screened, concentrated, and processed in the flotation plant to fill 
operating capacity, and have been included as resources after screening.  Estimated Resources for La 
Encantada Silver Mine total 7.0 million tonnes at an average grade of 173 g/tonne (5.6 oz/tonne) Ag and 
1.73 percent (38.1 lb/tonne) Pb.  Measured and Indicated Resources to October 31, 2007 are estimated 
to contain about 40.1 million ounces of silver equivalent net of lead credit. 

In addition to Measured and Indicated Resources, La Encantada has estimated about 2.0 million tonnes 
of Inferred Resources at an average grade of 200 g/tonne (6.33 oz/tonne) Ag and 0.50 percent (10.8 
lb/tonne) Pb, for a total silver equivalent of 13.4 million ounces. 

To date, La Encantada has demonstrated a continuity along approximately 4.0 kilometers of strike length 
and down dip for about 700 meters; so it is reasonable to assume that in the future Resources will 
continue to be converted to ore as additional drifting, crosscutting and raising define vein configurations, 
sampling and assaying determine the grade, and diamond drilling confirms vein extensions and fills in 
data gaps.

All Reserve and Resource blocks at La Encantada are exclusive of each category. 

PAH believes that these Reserve and Resource estimates have been reasonably prepared and conform to 
acceptable engineering standards for reporting of Reserves and Resources.  PAH believes that La 
Encantada Silver Mine classification of Reserves and Resources meets the standards of Canadian National 
Instrument NI 43-101 and the definitions of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum 
(CIM).

An economic analysis of FMS's La Encantada Silver Mine indicates that the mine's Reserve / Resources 
may be extracted at a profit, and PAH did not identify any significant technical, legal, environmental, 
political or other kind of restrictions; therefore, in PAH's opinion these Reserves and Resources may not 
be materially affected by issues that could prevent their extraction and processing.

22.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

La Encantada Silver Mine has been in operation since the 1950s, with intense extraction and processing 
operations from the early 1970's.  Its production, by Peñoles records, amounts to over 80 million ounces 
of silver and over 1.3 billion pounds of lead.  La Encantada is by no means exhausted; its geologic 
potential remains to be fully explored.  Several zones within the mine area have been identified that may 
contain significant mineralization, such as Breccia La Escalera, Breccia Milagros, Breccia San Javier and 
others that enable the operators to increase La Encantada's production. Aside from the oxidized 
mineralization, there are sulfides deposits identified within the skarn areas at Cuerpo 660, La Morena and 
deeper areas under the La Prieta and La Escondida chimneys.  These areas require intense exploration 
study by direct methods, such as diamond drilling and drifting. 

FMS has initiated an aggressive program of exploration based on drifting and diamond drilling. 
Preliminary results of this program have resulted in a significant increment of Resources and Reserves for 
the La Encantada Silver Mine for the period between June and October, 2007.  For instance, the Breccia 
Milagros and the San Francisco areas have produced high grade ores through exploration development 
and appear to be developing into significant ore deposits.    

PAH agrees with the continued implementation of the exploration program and recommends additional 
support for exploration activities at La Encantada.  Positive results would develop Resources into 
Reserves and extend the mine's life. 

Care must be taken to prioritize the exploration targets since the area holds a broad potential for 
development and possible discovery of new ore bodies.  Potential high volume areas should have priority 
in the exploration program, since these large volume deposits could potentially help to lower mine 
operating costs. 

FMS has suggested an exploration budget of US$2.40 Million for 2008 at La Encantada.  If successful, this 
program may result in a significant increment of Resources and additional Reserves.  The program 
includes approximately 8,200 meters of drilling from surface sites and 5,000 meters from underground 
locations.  Underground exploration development in drifting, access ramps, crosscutting and drill sites 
preparation amounts to about 2,400 meters for the year.  The budget for this program also includes 
about 50 km of geophysical surveying lines by Induced Polarization methods, and geochemical sampling 
of about 400 samples. PAH believes that this exploration program, budget and exploration targets are 
reasonable for investigating the La Encantada geologic potential. 

Table 22-1 shows the La Encantada exploration budget for 2008  

PAH recommends that La Encantada follow budgeted plans to replace the concentrate filter in the 
flotation plant with a better-quality machine and that the plant be gradually upgraded over the next three 
years installing good used equipment where possible.  The estimated cost for this is $575,000.

80523  March 19, 2008

Much of the mines mobile equipment at La Encantada is very old and requires replacement.  FMS has a 
plan in place to replace some of the older mine equipment in the near future.  For 2007, the capital 
budget includes funding for one scoop tram, trucks, compressor and safety equipment.  PAH believes 
that this is a reasonable program and agrees with FMS programmed investment of $575,000 for 2007.  
FMS has scheduled additional investments in mine equipment for the next two years for a total of $2.8 
million.

In PAH opinion La Encantada programmed capital expenditures for the year 2008, for a total of $2.375 M 
are scheduled to improve the operation and through a successful exploration program, increase the 
mine's Reserves and Resources and therefore the mine life.  

Details of projected cash flow are presented in Table 25-12.

25.0 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS ON
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES 

25.1 Introduction 

During the 35 years Peñoles operated the property, about 6.0 million tonnes of mainly oxidized silver-lead 
ores, which averaged about 418 grams Ag and 9.9 percent Pb per tonne, were mined and processed.  In 
2003, Peñoles leased the mine to a small company, Desmín, S.A. de C.V., who operated it from 2003 
until November 2006, when Desmín was acquired by First Majestic Silver Corp. (FMS) giving FMS control 
over the mine. FMS then acquired Minera La Encantada S.A. de C.V. (a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Peñoles) in March 2007 giving FMS ownership of the mine. There was no hiatus in the mine production 
program through the acquisition period and Desmín continued the operations until First Majestic took 
over in late 2006.  First Majestic continued with Desmín's development and production programs after the 
acquisition.  FMS made several changes in early 2007, and current production is about 15,700 tonnes per 
month of oxidized silver-lead ores.  Mill feed is not only derived from the underground mine, but also 
from old dump material left by both Peñoles and Desmín; the split for the first ten months of FMS 
operations in 2007 is about 9,000 tonnes per month from the mine and 6,700 tonnes per month from 
dump material.  Ore is campaign milled at the site in the differential flotation plant, originally constructed 
by Peñoles in the 1970s.  The mine produces a silver-lead concentrate, and paid metal production is 
currently about 102,500 ounces of silver and about 100,000 pounds of lead per month. 

25.2    Mine Design and Production 

La Encantada mine has largely been developed below ore zones indicated from surface exploration work 
within a block about four kilometers long, 700 meters wide and 500 meters in height.  The mine was 
initially developed from the shafts as a conventional operation with rail haulage levels, and utilizing 
standard rail-bound loading and hauling equipment.  Subsequently, La Encantada has been converted to 
a mainly trackless operation, although rail haulage is still used on a few of the deeper levels of the mine. 
The mine has been developed to the northeast of the shafts over a vertical range of about 400 meters 
from the surface (2,035 meters asl) to about the 1525 level (1,525 meters asl), where the water table 
has been encountered. The mine has not been developed into the large prospective area to the 
southwest of the shafts, which are situated at the southwest boundary of the developed mine area. 

The San Francisco and Maria Isabel shafts were sunk by the Peñoles-Lacana joint venture, mainly for the 
development and extraction of the Escondida and La Prieta chimneys and these shafts continue to be 
used by the current operators.  The collar elevations of both shafts, which are situated only about 100 
meters apart, is 1,800 meters asl for the Maria Isabel, and 1805 meters asl for the San Francisco, and the 
depths of both are about 300 meters.  Both the San Francisco and Maria Isabel Shafts provide access to 
the deeper levels of La Prieta and Escondida areas of the mine.   

The southern-most Maria Isabel Shaft is L-shaped with a manway cut-out and it is equipped with two in-
balance 3.7-t capacity skips, and a man cage.  The man cage capacity is about 15 people.  The 



Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 25.2 
80523  March 19, 2008

furnishings in the shaft are all constructed of steel, including dividers.  The guides for the ore skips are 
cables, and the guides for the man cage are steel H-beams.  The main air lines and electric power cables 
into the mine are installed in the manway compartment of the Maria Isabel Shaft.  The Maria Isabel ore 
hoist is a 500-hp Canadian Ingersoll-Rand 2-drum hoist, and the man-hoist is a Vulcan 125-hp 1-drum 
hoist.

The rectangular San Francisco Shaft is set up for ore hoisting only, with only a small emergency manway 
located in a corner of the shaft.  The Shaft is fitted with two in-balance 4.8-t capacity skips, but has no 
man cage.  The main pumping station for the mine is located on the San Francisco Shaft, and the mine 
pump lines are located in the shaft near the emergency manway.  The San Francisco ore hoist is a 2-
drum 400-hp Canadian Ingersoll-Rand unit. 

The main access to the current mine operations is a trackless adit at the 1,870 elevation.  This working 
has been enlarged to accommodate 20-t capacity highway-type dump trucks for ore and waste haulage 
from the mine.  Drifts and ramps are driven at a cross-section of about 3 X 3 meters, and the enlarged 
drifts and ramps to accommodate the larger dump trucks are about 4.5 X 5.0 meters in section.  Most 
areas of the mine are unsupported, but in a few places, rock bolts and wire mesh have been installed, 
and in other heavy ground areas, it has been necessary to install steel arches with timber lagging. FMS 
develops most of its short raises (<60 meters) by conventional methods, and most raises are driven at a 
cross-section area of about 1.5 X 1.5 meters. Historically long ore and waste pass raises, ventilation 
raises, etc. have been developed by raise boring contractors, and FMS will continue this policy as the 
need arises. 

A ramp system in the interior of the mine provides access for low-profile diesel mobile equipment up to 
the 2035 level and down to the 1635 level. The portion of the ramp above the 1870 level is being 
enlarged to accommodate the highway-type dump trucks. Peñoles established the 1790 main rail haulage 
level (from the Maria Isabel Shaft to the stoping and exploration areas) northeast of the shaft.  In 
addition a rail level was also developed at the 1635 level.  Both the rail levels are still in use. 

Mining operations at La Encantada mine are partially mechanized.  Drilling of headings for both 
development and stoping is accomplished using pneumatic hand-held jackleg machines.  Loading and 
tramming is done with diesel-powered, low profile front-end loaders (load-haul-dumps, or LHD's), and 
haulage is usually with highway-type diesel rear-dump trucks, or battery powered rail haulage trains.   

Before FMS acquired La Encantada from the previous operator, Desmín, little exploration and 
development work had been done in the mine.  Since taking over the operation in November 2006, FMS 
has undertaken an intensive exploration and development effort.  At this time, an average of about 500 
meters of drifts, raises and inclines and declines are driven each month; the exploration work amounts to 
about 400 meters per month, while the development work averages about 103 meters per month (Table 
25-1).  The maximum inclination on ramps is about 15 percent. As stated above, some mine workings are 
being slashed out to accommodate highway-type dump trucks, but the advance for these is not included 
in the development totals. 



Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 25.3 
80523  March 19, 2008

The monthly development totals for 2007 are shown in Table 25-1. 

The principal mining method employed at La Encantada is overhand cut-and-fill (Figure 25-1), utilizing 
development waste for fill. Ramps are driven into the orebodies and stopes are developed from sill drifts 
driven in the ore zones and slashed out the full width of the ore.  Stopes are drilled with jacklegs, and the 
main blasting agent is a commercial ammonium nitrate product, which is initiated with sausages of water-
gel explosive primed with cap and fuse.  Rounds are fired with Ignitacord (B-cord) as the fuse initiator.  
Stopes are mucked with rubber-tired 1.0- to 2.0 yd3 Load-Haul-Dump (LHD's) machines, which also tram 
the broken ore to ore passes or remuck stations.  Completed stope cuts are backfilled with development 
waste, which is passed through raises into the stope or trammed into the stope with the LHD units.  
Stope production is about 8,500 tonnes per month, and there are currently about 10 stopes in 
production.  The monthly mine production for 2007 is shown in Table 25-2.

Most of La Encantada's mine development and stoping work is done by outside contractors, using 
company equipment.  Mobile equipment operation is done with company crews, and maintenance and 
other mine services are also done with company personnel.  If the company does not have sufficient 
personnel to operate the mobile mucking and haulage equipment, the contractors will operate the 
equipment for extra fees.  Ore haulage to the mine patios is done with contractor dump trucks, and ore 
transfers from the patios to the mill crusher bins are also done with outside contractors using their own 
trucks.

The operators plan to eventually reinitiate extraction of La Prieta and La Escondida abandoned chimneys, 
which were first mined by caving methods by Peñoles in the early years of the mine operation.  The 
workings for the extraction of both chimneys caved in and were lost, with much waste rock material 
dumped into the glory-holes, at the surface.  The purpose of the waste rock was to stabilize the areas 
proximal to the chimneys.  Some ground movements have occurred in the form of concentric cracks 
around the ore boundaries of the chimneys, and since the chimneys are situated very  
near to both the main production shafts, ground movements could affect the stability of these 
installations.  In fact some cracks in the walls of hoistroom of the San Francisco shaft have been noted, 
apparently as a result of caving of the chimneys.  Extraction of remnants left in these chimneys is 
technically possible, but should be delayed until the two shafts are no longer required for production or 
service.

A separate mine dump recovery effort is also being conducted at the mine site.  This operation consists 
of the excavation and screening of old dump material from the previous operations, and transporting the 
screened product to the mill ore bins as supplemental mill feed material. The dump recovery operation is 
done by a combination of company operators and contractors.  The company has acquired a new 
screening plant in a rental/purchase arrangement for increasing the production from the operation.  
Currently about 6,700 tonnes per month at average grades of over 100 gpt Ag are being shipped to the 
mill.  The operators estimate that there are over 160,000 tonnes of dump material, which averages about 
94 gpt Ag and negligible lead available for recovery.  This material will only be viable if screened, in 
which case only about 22 percent, or about 35,000 tonnes, would be shipped to the mill with the 
remainder left as coarse rejects.  The average silver grade in the screened dump material would contain 
about 42 percent of the total silver and the grade should improve to about 181 gpt Ag.   

The mine currently operates on three shifts per day, 7 days per week.  Both contractor crews and 
company personnel work the same shift schedule.  Most company and contractor personnel live in the 
town of Musquiz, Coahuila, which is situated about 210 km on paved highways to the northwest of the 
Encantada Mine.  The company is currently transporting all personnel to and from Múzquiz to the mine 
site in a company bus.  Peñoles constructed and maintained about 180 houses, as well as a primary 
school, stores and recreational facilities in the proximity of the mine site, and FMS management is 
considering refurbishing the facilities, and accommodating the workforce in company controlled living 
quarters. 

The current mine workforce (as of October 31, 2007) totals 243 people including contractors and a 
breakdown is as shown in Table 25-3. 

The budget for 2007 is for production of 129,000 tonnes from the mine and 60,000 tonnes from the old 
mine dumps (Table 25-4). The milled tonnes are budgeted somewhat lower than the mine production 
tonnes, or 108,500 tonnes milled from the mine and 59,800 tonnes from the dump recovery, or a total of 
168,300 tonnes milled.  The average grades to the mill are budgeted at 359 gpt Ag; 500 gpt Ag for the 
mine and 170 gpt Ag for the dumps.  Desmín did not do any reconciliations, comparing mine production 
results with tonnes and grades milled in La Encantada plant.  FMS will do this in the future, but currently 
has not done any comparisons, because of the sparse data from their short operations period.  FMS 
recently reinforced its mine engineering department and the reconciliation effort will be one of the tasks 
that will be under taken by the engineers.

25.3 Mine Equipment 

Most of the mine equipment used at La Encantada was inherited from the previous operator; Desmín and 
Desmín acquired most it from Peñoles.  The mobile equipment fleet includes several sizes, ranging from 
1.0-yd3 to 3.5-yd3 capacity, of primarily Wagner diesel-powered LHD's.  A summary of La Encantada Mine 
Equipment is shown in Table 25-5.  

As can be appreciated from Table 25-5, much of the mine mobile equipment fleet is very old, and 
requires replacement.  FMS management has a plan in place to replace much of the older mine 
equipment in the future.  For 2007, the capital budget includes funding for a scoop tram, trucks, 
compressor and safety equipment.   

25.4 Mineral Processing Plant 

Principal parameters of the ore processing plant, including concentrate freight, smelting and refining 
values, are presented in Table 25-6 and a listing of the principal equipment is shown in Table 25-7.  A 
flow diagram of the plant is provided in Figure 25-2.  The plant was constructed in 1973 and at that time 
incorporated magnetic separation.  In 1977 the plant was modified to convert it to flotation separation. 

Ore is from two sources: from the underground mine and from old mine dumps with the mine 
contributing about 60 percent of the feed while the processing of dump material accounts for the rest.  
The dump rock is screened ahead of the plant which results in upgrading the rock to about twice the 
grade of unscreened material.  Mine and dump ore are not mixed; they are campaign processed through 
the plant. 

The plant is a small, simple flotation plant in a single-line arrangement.  Crushing is accomplished using 
two stages of crushing closed on the second stage, and the ore is milled in a single ball mill closed with a 
cyclone.  The mill is rubber lined and is charged with 2-1/2-inch diameter grinding balls.  Sulfide minerals 
and oxide minerals are floated sequentially and neither circuit incorporates cleaning; rougher 
concentrates are the final concentrate.  However, both the sulfide and oxide systems have rougher-
scavengers with the rougher-scavenger concentrates recycled to the head of the roughers. 

Concentrates from both the sulfide and oxide circuits are combined in a concentrate thickener.  
Thickened concentrates are filtered on a filter press and the filtered concentrate is stockpiled and trucked 
to the Peñoles smelter at Torreon. 

Tailings are thickened and then pumped to a nearby tailings containment.  Tailings thickener overflow 
and the decant water from the tailings containment are pumped to a recycle-water tank and reused in 
the process.

25.5 Infrastructure 

The infrastructure for La Encantada was very well developed by the previous operators, especially 
Peñoles.  The operations support facilities, located near the plant, include administrative offices, a 
medical clinic, warehouse, assay laboratory, power generation plant, fuel storage facilities, maintenance 
shops, mine compressor building, surface maintenance shop, mine dry, water storage tanks, employee 
hotel and dining hall, contractor offices and security guard shack.  The Maintenance Department operates 
from the surface shops, and also from an underground shop (840 level), located near the center of the 
mine.  Road maintenance is done with a fleet of company tractors, road grader and wheel loaders.  
Dump trucks for ore haulage and road maintenance are largely vehicles contracted locally.  The company 
has a passenger bus for transporting operations personnel to and from the town of Múzquiz, where most 
employees have homes. 

The company also has a town constructed by Peñoles, and which is partially occupied at this time.  The 
town site has 180 housing units of which 70 are occupied.  There is also a kitchen/dining room for 
salaried staff and some contractor managers and visitors, a primary school, a church, a store, 
recreational facilities, etc.  The company has had problems with turnover at the operation, mainly 
because of the long commute to and from the site every weekend.  Management is planning to refurbish 
the company housing and offer housing to employees at a nominal rental fee. 

The electric power for the operation and supporting infrastructure is generated on-site.  The power 
generation plant consists of three General Motors 3,250 KVA diesel-powered motor generators. In 
addition there are two 1,000 KVA CAT D399 motor-generator sets for site power, when the mill and 
process plant are idle.   Power consumption is presently about 800,000 kW per month.  The 2007 cost of 
electric power is presently about $0.18 per kWhr.  The mine is situated about 45 km from a major 
government (Comisión Federal de Electricidad) power line, and the company will examine the possibility 
of connecting to this line, and discontinuing use of the diesel plants, keeping them in reserve for 
emergencies or supplemental power generation during peak cost hours of operation. 

Potable water for the offices and employee housing is derived from a well in the mine, which penetrates 
below the water table.  The industrial water for the mine and plant is obtained from a series of wells 
located about 15 kilometers from the site.  This water is pumped to and stored in a number of storage 
tanks located throughout the plant and mine site.   

Communications to and from La Encantada is via satellites, both for wireless internet information 
systems, and also for the telephone system.  Currently the telephone system has two lines.  La 
Encantada has a site radio system for instant communications between all Supervisors and Managers, 
and all surface vehicle operators also have radio communication capabilities. 

There is a FMS owned airstrip located in the broad valley to the northwest of the mine site.  This strip is 
suitable for light planes, and is used for flying in emergency supplies, or for transporting mine personnel, 
visitors and others into and out of La Encantada, and other nearby locations.  The airstrip is 1,200 meters 
long, 17 meters wide, and has a gravel surface.

Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 25.14 
80523  March 19, 2008

The site is connected with the national highway system and, although in a remote location, La Encantada 
is reasonably accessible.  The access to the mine from the town of Múzquiz, Coahuila, which lies to the 
northeast of La Encantada, accessible via a 45 kilometers of gravel road, and then another 170 kilometers 
on a paved highway to Múzquiz. 

25.6 Tailings

Tailings are deposited in a large storage impoundment located in a natural basin to the northwest of the 
process plant site.  The impoundment is a continuation of that used by both Desmín and Peñoles, and 
construction of the impoundment berms is with the up-stream method, constructing berms using borrow 
material placed on top of consolidated tailings.  FMS is constructing a new berm, which should be 
adequate to contain tailings for at least five years of operations (at current mining and processing rates). 

25.7 Product Marketing

FMS has a purchase agreement with MET-MEX Peñoles located in the city of Torreón, State of Coahuila, 
México.  The purchase agreement establishes the obligation to sell all mineral production from La 
Encantada mine to the Peñoles smelter.  This, however, is the natural market for concentrates since the 
MET-MEX Peñoles smelter is the closest such facility for shipping La Encantada concentrates.  The 
contract between La Encantada and Peñoles for sales of bulk flotation concentrate is typical for this 
product.

La Encantada purchase contract of concentrates with Peñoles includes typical conditions and related 
charges as follows: 

� Each lot is weighed upon receipt and sampled.  La Encantada also weighs and samples the shipments 
at the mine site. 

� Smelting charge per dry tonne of concentrate is $215.00. 
� Freight cost per tonne of concentrate is $36.00. 
� Refining cost per payable kilogram of silver is $12.50 
� Payables by Peñoles are: 95 percent for contained silver, and all of the contained lead in excess of 3 

percent.

25.8 Environmental Safety Review 

Minera La Encantada has been operating La Encantada mine since the early 1970's with the necessary 
land-use and water extraction permits in effect for the operation.  FMS has purchased the land surface 
rights, under expropriation procedures from Ejido Tenochtitlán, where the camp, water wells, mine and 
plant installations are located to better manage the property. Through the years and changes in the 
regulatory framework, La Encantada has been required to update the necessary operation permits. 



 ___ _____________
Pincock, Allen & Holt AMENDED 25.15 
80523  March 19, 2008

In April 24, 2007 La Encantada presented a notification of reactivation of operations at the mine to the 
National Water Commission (C.N.A.), to SEMARNAT, to Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social, and to 
PROFEPA.  La Encantada mine was declared in suspension of activities by Peñoles in 2003.   

PAH's environmental and safety review consisted of discussions with FMS's COO Ing. Ramón Dávila 
Flores, and mine manager and supervisors, Ing. José Luis Arana, Manager of Operations, and other 
personnel.  PAH visited the site to observe the current site safety and environmental conditions and to 
identify any potential liabilities having significant economic impacts, and a briefly reviewed file records 
provided to PAH during the site visit.  PAH's assessment was not intended as an environmental and 
safety compliance audit, although prudent practices were considered in the review.  In PAH's opinion, La 
Encantada is in compliance with regulatory requirements and only subject to confirmation of the required 
permits and authorizations. 

In general, surface disturbance related to mining is limited to the access road to the mining levels, waste 
rock dumps at each portal, and auxiliary support areas.  Development waste rock is used for fill inside the 
mine and limits the size of waste rock dumps at the surface. Most of these activities are carried out on 
land owned by La Encantada.  No acid rock drainage (ARD) is produced from the mine workings. 

PAH noted no visible evidence of ARD on the active and historic tailings deposition areas or spent heap 
leach pile.  The surface of the active tailings impoundment is wetted, which controls fugitive dust 
emissions. 

The grinding area, agitated leach tanks, wash thickeners, cyanide mix tank, and several other process 
vessels in the mill area have spill containment. There are minimal stormwater control measures to route 
uncontaminated runoff away from the mill or to collect and contain stormwater runoff from around the 
mill site.

La Encantada has good control of the storage of hazardous chemicals and lubricants at the mill site and 
has installed concrete pads and fenced areas for drums.  

Although Mexican environmental legislation is not explicit in the requirements for remediation, 
reclamation, and closure, the SEMARNAP expresses concern for the preservation and restoration of the 
environment and natural ecosystems in its environmental management guidance for industry.  In fact, 
SEMARNAP recommends that facilities establish and implement a program for remediation of spills and 
releases to the environment. 

La Encantada has not supplied to PAH the estimated costs for reclamation and mine closure of the mine 
or mill and tailings containment areas; however, PAH considers the costs will be low because La 
Encantada owns most of the surface rights where the installations and mine are located.   

PAH's estimate for the costs required to comply with and remediate the environmental issues for the 
project is approximately $150,000 in addition to the salvage value of plant and mine equipment. These 
costs are based on PAH's experience in mining projects in México, and are not the result of detailed

analysis.  Actual costs will depend on site conditions and impacts from the operation, regulatory 
requirements at the time of compliance, and corporate environmental management standards. 

25.9 Economic Analysis

25.9.1 Capital Costs 

The FMS capital expenditures planned for 2007 was a total of $6.2 million while this amount is $3.7 
million for 2008. The 3-year capital budget (2007-2009) is $11.3 million including the acquisition costs of 
the property, mill and power plant upgrades, mine equipment additions and replacements, exploration 
and infrastructure development costs.  Major capital expenditures in the program registered for the first 
ten months of 2007 is the acquisition cost from Peñoles and investments in exploration, some mine 
equipment and plant improvements.   The capital cost schedule for La Encantada six-year plan is shown 
in the Table 25-8.

25.9.2  Operating Costs 

La Encantada operating costs for the first ten months of 2007 have averaged US$38.22 per tonne of ore 
processed, inclusive of dump material, which equates to a cost per ounce of silver of US$6.06.  The costs 
include downstream concentrate freight and processing costs of about US$8.90 per tonne milled or 
US$1.41 per ounce of silver recovered. The average combined operating cost for 2007 is projected to 
average about US$50 per tonne milled. A summary of the combined mine and dump recovery operating 
costs for the first ten months of 2007 is found in Table  25-9. 

The average mine-only operating cost is US$53.33 per tonne, and also includes costs for the downstream 
processing of the silver-lead concentrates.  The site-only operating cost for the mine generated ore has 
averaged about US$40.30 per tonne, and the total cost per ounce of silver obtained from mine ore has 
averaged US$3.92 per oz Ag for 2007.   The downstream concentrate freight and smelting and refining 
costs are US$13.03 per tonne or US$1.29 per oz Ag for the first ten months of 2007.   A summary of the 
mine-only operating costs is shown in Table 25-10.

The average costs for extraction and processing of the old dump material for 2007 are US$17.13 per 
tonne, or US$7.07 per oz Ag produced.  The site-only costs for extraction, screening, milling and 
processing of the old dump material have averaged US$14.11 per tonne or US$5.82 per oz Ag for 2007 
(10 months) plus US$3.02 per tonne or US$1.24 per oz Ag for concentrate freight and downstream 
smelting and refining.   

Table 25-11 is a summary of the operating costs for the first ten months of 2007 for the dump recovery 
effort.

25.9.3  Economic Analysis 

A simplified cash flow forecast has been prepared and is presented as Table 25-12.  The economics 
covers the period from January 2008 through December 2012, at which time the known Proven / 
Probable Reserves will be exhausted and the fifth year's production will be extracted from the Measured 
and Indicated Resources.  In the interim, it is expected that underground exploration will be advanced 
through both diamond drilling and drifting, and that Reserves will continually be added over time. 

Table 25-9 shows a summary of Operating Costs. 

Basic premises for the cash flow involve the silver price, which is taken as US$10.50/ounce.  The lead 
price is taken as US$0.68/lb.  No escalation was considered for operating costs and expenses.  
Reclamation expenditures are considered spent in the last three years of the period. It can be seen from 
the table that a net present value for the project at a 15-percent discount rate is approximately US$5.2 
million.

Sensitivity analyses were performed at different discount rates and the analysis shows robust economics 
for La Encantada, as follows ($US): 

� At 0 % discount   $12.8 million 

� At 10 % discount   $6.5 million 

� Base Case @ 15 % discount  $4.7 million 

� At 20 % discount   $3.4 million 

� At 25 % discount   $2.5 million 

As expected, the project exhibits the greatest sensitivity to metal prices, followed by operating costs, and 
finally by capital costs.  Any variances in grade or metallurgical recovery will be equivalent to similar 
changes in metal prices, since all three factors impact the revenue stream equally.  In all cases, however, 
the La Encantada mine shows positive economics as measured by a cash flow exercise, except when the 
price of silver falls by 20 percent.  Therefore, the postulated reserve position is accepted. 

The La Encantada mine is an existing operation, mining and processing high grade ores, therefore a 
payback period for the purchase price of Minera La Encantada from Peñoles is at the second full year of 
operation.  It can be seen from Table 25-12 that there is sufficient after-tax operational cash flow in any 
year to adequately cover projected capital expenditures. 

The mine life, based on the Proven / Probable Reserve position, is about 4.0 years and covers production 
through 2011.
