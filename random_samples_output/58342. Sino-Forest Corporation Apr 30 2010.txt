ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS 

This report was prepared at the request of and for the exclusive use of the client, 
Sino-Forest Corporation. This report may not be used for any purpose other than 
the purpose for which it was prepared. Its use is restricted to consideration of its 
entire contents. This valuation represents an update of Pöyry's 31 December 2008 
forest valuation that was presented in Report 54A11173: Valuation of China Forest 
Assets as at 31 December 2008. 

Data describing the area of forest owned, by species, age and location were 
provided by Sino-Forest. 

Pöyry has not viewed any of the contracts relating to forest land use rights or 
cutting rights or forest asset purchases. Legal matters are beyond the scope of this 
report and the valuation is prepared on the assumption that titles to the forest assets 
are according to the data provided by Sino-Forest. Maps, diagrams and pictures 
presented in this report are intended merely to assist the reader. 

Inspections of Sino-Forest areas were made as part of this valuation. These were at 
specific locations selected by Pöyry and in the main species or species groups 
comprising the Sino-Forest estate, i.e. Chinese fir, 'other species' which are 
mixtures of planted hardwoods, (mainly oak) and pines, natural broadleaf, and 
eucalypts. The inspections were carried out in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan and 
Yunnan provinces during the period 13 to 18 December 2009 and 9 to 11 March 
2010. In addition, during late December 2009 and early January 2010, 20 person-
days were spent visiting log processors, markets and Forestry Bureaus in 
Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan and Yunnan provinces gathering basic data and 
information on log prices. 

This appraisal assumes that the forests visited by Pöyry in the field inspection 
represent the full range of conditions that exist for the species seen. Very limited 
yield information for Sino-Forest's estate was made available to Pöyry for the 
purpose of this appraisal.  

Any existing liens and encumbrances have been disregarded, and the forest 
resource has been appraised as though free and clear under responsible ownership 
and competent management. 

Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous materials or other 
adverse environmental conditions, which may or may not be present on the 
property, were neither called to the attention of Pöyry, nor did the consultants 
become aware of such during the inspection. 

Pöyry recognises the possibility that any valuation can eventually become the 
subject of audit or court testimony. If such audit or testimony becomes necessary as 
a result of this valuation, it will be a new assignment subject to fees then in effect. 
Pöyry has no responsibility to update this report for events and circumstances 
occurring after the date of this report.

for work conducted by Pöyry. Nothing in the report is, or should be relied upon, as 
a promise by Pöyry as to the future growth, yields, costs or returns of the forests. 
Actual results may be different from the opinion contained in this report, as 
anticipated events may not occur as expected and the variation may be significant.

SUMMARY 

Sino-Forest Corporation (Sino-Forest or "the Company") is a forest management 
and trading company that owns and operates about 491 000 hectares (ha) of 
commercial forest in China. 

In addition, Sino-Forest has advised Pöyry that it currently holds the land-use rights 
for a further 200 000 mu, or 13 330 ha of bareland and that it also owns a 
plantation forest of about 8 020 ha in area that is used specifically for research and 
development purposes. Neither this bareland nor research forest has been 
considered in this valuation. 

The forest estate is composed mainly of Chinese fir, 'other species' a mixture of 
planted hardwoods, (mainly oak) and pines, natural broadleaf, eucalypts and pines. 
Most of the forest is situated in the Guangxi, Hunan, and Yunnan provinces of 
southern China.  

Since 2003, Pöyry has conducted annual market valuations for Sino-Forest. Pöyry 
has again been engaged by Sino-Forest to estimate the market value of the tree 
crops in these forests, as at 31 December 2009, which is the subject of this report.  

Unlike most forest owners and managers, Sino-Forest actively trades in forests. 
Each year the company both sells and buys forests, and accordingly the 
composition of the forest estate changes much more than for a business that is 
simply managing and harvesting a more static resource.  

Over the past year, the area of the estate has increased by 156 000 ha, or 47% over 
the 2008 area. Areas of forest have been both acquired and sold. As at December 
2009 the area weighted average age of the forest was 19.0 years compared with 
15.3 years at December 2008. Sino-Forest's estate could be described as 'dynamic'. 

For valuation purposes, such a dynamic forest estate requires careful review of the 
key components influencing wood flows and cash flows. As part of this year's 
valuation, Pöyry has established and measured a small number of inventory plots in 
the 'other' species in Guangxi, some Chinese fir in Hunan, broadleaf forest in 
Yunnan and planted eucalypts in Guangdong province. Some adjustments to yield 
tables used in last year's valuation have been made. In addition, Pöyry has sought 
to verify Sino-Forest's representation of the net stocked area of forest. These two 
factors (yield and stocked area) are the main physical features of the forest that 
influence wood flow, cash flow and forest value.  

Pöyry has also reviewed the key financial factors influencing forest value, 
including log prices, forestry and harvesting costs, and the appropriate discount rate 
to apply to the cash flows expected to arise from the forest estate. 

Pöyry has estimated the market value of Sino-Forest's tree crop assets, as at 
31 December 2009, to be USD2 297.5 million. 

This is the net present value of the cash flows expected to arise from the 
management and harvest of the existing tree crops over their current rotation. A 



2BA12945

discount rate of 11.5% has been applied to these pre-tax cash flows. This is the 
same discount rate as applied last year. This market value does not include costs 
associated with the regeneration of the existing forest, nor revenues from their 
harvesting and sale. 

Table S-1 shows the sensitivity of the tree crop value to changes in the discount 
rate.

The market value of Sino-Forest's tree crop assets as at December 2009 has 
increased by USD653 million, or 40% from Pöyry's valuation as at December 
2008.  

Changes to the physical nature of the asset as a result of growth, changes in the 
area and maturity of forest owned from sales and purchases, and forecast yield, 
combine to produce USD647 million or 99% of the value increase. Changes in 
costs and log prices almost cancel each other out, with the majority of the balance 
of the value increase arising from a favourable change in the exchange rate, from 
RMB to USD, as at 31 December 2009.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Sino-Forest Corporation (Sino-Forest) owns and operates approximately 
491 000 hectares (ha) of forest in China1. Two main business models are operated 
by Sino-Forest. The first is the establishment, management and harvest of new 
forests. The second is the acquisition, management and harvest or stumpage sale of 
existing tree crops and forests. A stumpage sale is the sale of trees while they are 
still standing in the forest. Here, the future harvesting of the forest is the 
responsibility of the eventual purchaser. This aspect of Sino-Forest's business 
could be described as forest management and trading.  

Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited (Pöyry) has been requested by Sino-
Forest to prepare a valuation of its forest crop assets in China, as at 31 December 
2009. Pöyry has previously conducted forest valuations for Sino-Forest in 2000, 
2001, and 2003 to 2008 inclusive. 

This valuation presents an update of Pöyry's 31 December 2008 forest valuation 
that was presented in Report 54A11173. 

 

                                                 
 

1 In addition, Sino-Forest has advised Pöyry that it currently holds the land-use rights for a further 
200 000 mu, or 13 330 ha of bareland that it will plant in the future. This land has not been 
considered in the forest management and cash flow modelling and does not affect the value of the 
existing tree crops currently owned. Furthermore, Sino-Forest has advised Pöyry that it also owns a 
plantation forest of about 8 020 ha in area that is used specifically for research and development 
purposes. No details of this forest have been provided to Pöyry and it has not been considered in this 
valuation.

2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 

2.1 Purpose of the Valuation Update 
The purpose of the valuation is to estimate the market value of the forests for asset 
reporting purposes. A useful definition of "market value" is: 

"the most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and 
open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller 
each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming that the price is not 
affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a 
sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under 
conditions whereby:  

 The buyer and seller are typically motivated. 

 Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they 
consider their own best interests. 

 A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market. 

 The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold 
unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by 
anyone associated with the sale"1.  

The market value of the tree crop assets is estimated as at 31 December 2009. 

The term "Market Value" is usually interchangeable with "Fair Value" as defined 
in International Accounting Standard 41 (IAS 41). IAS 41 prescribes the 
accounting treatment, financial statement presentation, and disclosures related to 
agricultural activity.  

In IAS 41, "Fair Value" is defined as "the amount for which an asset could be 
exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an 
arm's length transaction". 

2.2 Scope of the Valuation Update 
As a valuation update, the exercise has specifically addressed the following: 

 Changes to the area of tree crops, by location, species and age, between 
31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009. 

 Acknowledgement of recent inventory data and their impact on yield estimates. 

 Acknowledgement of changes in forestry and harvest related costs. 

 Acknowledgement of expectations for generally higher longer term log prices. 

 The relative maturity and age-class profile of the Sino-Forest estate, and the 
potential to harvest a large volume of wood in the near term.

3 VALUATION METHODOLOGY 
It is recommended practice when appraising real property to consider three main 
approaches: 

 The comparable sales method (i.e. referencing the results of market 
transactions of other properties similar to the subject property). 

 The income method (i.e. assessing the present value of the anticipated future 
net earnings stream). 

 The costs method (i.e. acknowledging what it would cost to recreate the asset 
in its current condition). 

It then rests with the appraiser's professional judgement to assess what weighting 
should be applied to the results from the respective methods. 

The assessment of forest investments generally requires the examination of cash 
flows over a long time period. This leads to the application of discounted cash flow 
analysis techniques (DCF) as an indispensable part of the appraisal process. Each 
of the three main approaches may come to be applied within a DCF framework. 
Thus; 

 The cost method may be applied with wholly young stands and especially 
those where relying on a discounting approach alone produces values unlikely 
to be supported by the market. In valuing the young stands reference is made to 
their costs of establishment. In order to recognise the forest owner's 
entitlement to a return on investment, a compounding approach may be 
applied, requiring the selection of a suitable compounding rate. Compounding 
is the inverse of discounting and there is a need to select an appropriate rate. 

 The income method employs a conventional discounting approach. In 
referencing wider evidence of investors' expectations of a return on capital, 
one common basis for the discount rate is the Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital (WACC). The cost of equity may be examined within the Capital Asset 
Pricing Model (CAPM).  

 The comparable sales approach may also employ a DCF framework. This is 
particularly necessary because such sales evidence as does exist is rarely 
immediately comparable on a convenient unit basis (e.g. USD/ha or USD/m3). 
In order to effect adjustments it is necessary to consider relative forest 
maturity, and this leads back to DCF analysis. Ultimately the one parameter 
that can be distilled from sales and then extrapolated to a subject forest is the 
Implied Discount Rate (IDR). This is obtained from other contemporary 
transactions by relating constructed cash flows for the sold forests to their 
respective transaction values. 

It is Pöyry's opinion that the parties to any real or hypothetical transaction 
involving Sino-Forest's forest assets would not attribute weight to the cost method 
of valuation. This method has not therefore been further addressed in this valuation. 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  4 

Both the comparable sales and income approaches have been considered. Their 
application has shared the same forest estate model which provides the means of 
projecting future anticipated cash flows2. The distinction between the approaches 
has been maintained in the basis for selecting the discount rates. 

The scope of the market valuation is confined to the projected cash flows arising 
from the existing tree crop. Previous expenditure on the forest is treated as "sunk" 
and is therefore excluded from the derivation of value. Perpetual wood-flows are 
modelled, but their financial contributions are not included in the derived market 
value. 

A full description of Valuation Methodology is provided in Appendix 1. 

 

                                                 
 
2 It is debatable whether the income and comparable sales approaches should share exactly the same basis for cash 
flow projection. It could be argued that the WACC employed in the income approach inherently assumes that the 
cash flows have been "de-risked" to a greater extent than commonly applies in the derivation of IDRs.

4 FOREST DESCRIPTION  
Since Pöyry's December 2008 valuation, the area of forest operated by Sino-
Forest's has increased from approximately 335 000 ha to over 491 000 ha. 
Guangxi, Hunan and Yunnan are the three largest provinces in terms of Sino-
Forest's holdings. The largest change in area by province, both in absolute and 
relative terms has been in Yunnan, where the area of forest owned has almost 
tripled, from around 39 000 ha to almost 106 000 ha over the past year (see Figure 
4-2). 

The species composition of the forest estate has also changed over the past year. 
See Figure 4-2. The net area of most species has increased, with broadleaf 
(53 000 ha increase) and 'other species' (43 000 ha increase) representing the 
largest increases.  

The area weighted average age of the Sino-Forest estate, as at 31 December 2009 is 
19.0 years. This compares with an area weighted average age of 15.3 years as at 
31 December 2008. Considering that the typical age of harvest of Chinese fir, pines 
and broadleaf forests in southern China is in the range 18 to 30 years, the Sino-
Forest estate could be described as mature.

Eucalypts are mainly E.grandis * urophylla hybrids, 'Other Species' also referred to as 'OTHR', mainly 
intimate mixtures of oak and other planted hardwoods, sometimes with  Masson pine, most of the Broadleaf 
forest is second growth hardwood forest in Yunnan province, and Foreign pine is mainly slash pine ( Pinus 
elliottii). 

When applied to plantation forest resources, the term "Forest Description" is a 
technical term. It includes all aspects of the forest's current physical condition. It 
also includes projections of the forests future growth performance. Further, it 
includes financial parameters; specifically the costs involved in growing and 
harvesting the forest and estimates of the prices for the products that will arise.  

The following sections describe the forest resource in terms of the stocked area, the 
nature of the land and terrain, the species planted, and Pöyry's estimates of future 
growth and yield. This comprises the 'physical forest description'.  

Subsequent sections outline the 'financial forest description' which details all 
forestry and harvesting costs. It also includes Pöyry's analysis of current and 
projected log prices. 

The physical and financial forest descriptions are combined in a forest estate 
model. This allows for the modelling of the forest in terms of the physical wood 
flows as well as the financial cash flows. 

Sino-Forest has provided Pöyry with detailed data describing the area of forest 
crops owned by species, planting year and location. It also specified which forests 
were planted by Sino-Forest and which were purchased. Based on this data, as at 
31 December 2009, Sino-Forest owns 491 394 ha of forest crops. 

A summary of these data is presented in the following map and figures.

4.1 Field Inspections 
As part of the 2009 valuation Pöyry undertook a field inspection exercise. The 
main purpose of the inspection is to compare the forest description provided by the 
client with the actual conditions on the ground. In the case of Sino-Forest, this 
description amounts to tabular and map information of forest type by age and 
location. 

Pöyry's normal approach to forest inspection is to visit different parts of the forest 
estate over successive valuations and thereby confirm the full forest description 
over a period of time.  

This is more challenging in the case of Sino-Forest who not only manages and 
harvests forests, but also actively trades large areas of forest owned. As a result, the 
composition of Sino-Forest's estate can change quite significantly from one year to 
the next. Pöyry's comparisons of the stocked area by species, province and planting 
year, as at 31 December 2008 and 2009,  indicates that a maximum of 53% of Sino-
Forest's estate, as at 31 December 2009, could have been within the Sino-Forest 
estate just one year earlier. That means that a minimum area of 230 000 ha of forest 
was acquired in 2009. 

As the Sino-Forest resource changes significantly year by year, there is a greater 
need for more detailed annual forest inspections and forest description reviews. 

The three provinces of Guangxi, Hunan and Yunnan together contain about 
391 000 ha or about 80% of the total forest area of 491 000 ha. Guangxi contains 
150 000 ha, including 60 000 ha or 57% of the total 'Other Species' area. Hunan 
contains 135 000 ha, including 101 000 ha or 67% of the total Chinese fir. Yunnan 
contains 106 000 ha, including 85 000 ha or 99% of the total broadleaf forest. The 
75 000 ha eucalyptus plantations are predominantly located in the Guangdong 
(50%) and Guangxi (44%) provinces. 

The field inspections for the 2009 valuation focused on forest acquired over the 
past year and eucalypt plantings in a part of Guangdong that was not visited last

year. Inspections in the purchased forest were in 'Other Species' in Guangxi 
province, Chinese fir in a county in southern Hunan that was not inspected last 
year, and  broadleaf in Yunnan province. (See Appendices 2 and 3). 

The work undertaken during the field inspections comprised: 

 Establishing a small number of inventory plots to record tree measurements 

 Recording GPS locations and associated land form and vegetation type 

 Interviews with Forest Bureaus  

 Interviews with staff at wood-processing facilities and log buyers. 

Section 4.3 deals with the work undertaken to verify the stocked area of forest. 

4.2 Land and Tree Crops 
The following table provides some provincial statistics on area, forest cover and 
terrain for the eight provinces in which Sino-Forest owns forests.

Note: these are provincial level statistics, not applying specifically to Sino-Forest's forest or land. 

Mountain land is typically >35 degrees in slope, and flat land <15 degrees. Most 
commercial forest is on hill and mountain land. The nature of the forest terrain in 
the various provinces has been used in combination with actual local data to 
estimate logging costs (see Section 6.2). 

Chinese fir makes up about 151 000 ha, or 31% of the total forest area. This is 
followed by 'Other Species' (106 000 ha or 22%) and broadleaf species (88 000 ha 
or 18%). 

Eucalypts (grandis X urophylla) make up about 75 000 ha, or 15% of the total 
forest area. Of the eucalypt area, two-thirds, or 50 000 ha is forest that Sino-Forest 
has planted itself. The company has also planted about 2 000 ha of slash pine and 
1 000 ha of Chinese fir, mostly in Hunan province.

4.3 Forest Area 
Two key components of the physical forest description are the net stocked area of 
forest and the harvest yield or volume of logs per unit area. The product of these 
factors, area (in hectares) and yield (in cubic metres per hectare) are the main 
features of the forest that determine the wood flow over time. Accordingly it is 
important for the forest valuer to independently assess both the area of the forest 
and the likely yield. 

This section presents the results of Pöyry's verification of Sino-Forest's stocked 
area of forest. Details of this work are provided in Appendix 4. 

As described above, Pöyry used the data provided by Sino-Forest on the location, 
the species and age of the estate to plan its field inspection for 2009. Within the 
selected provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan and Hunan, counties were 
selected with regard to the area by species and age-classes that they contained. In 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  11 

addition, consideration was given to the counties in which Pöyry conducted its field 
inspections last year and where it was apparent that large areas had been acquired 
since the last valuation. 

On request from Pöyry, Sino-Forest provided a set of what are termed 'cluster-
maps'. Each cluster-map showed compartment (forest management unit) 
boundaries and stocked areas for a number (cluster) of compartments. They also 
showed geographic co-ordinates that allowed registration of these maps for use in a 
GIS. Several such cluster-maps were provided for each of the counties selected for 
Pöyry's field work.  

Pöyry used maps representing 66 compartments for its area verification. These 
maps represented 1 611 ha of forest, or about 0.3% of the 491 000 ha owned. The 
verification was performed largely by mapping the stocked area as visible from 
satellite imagery, and comparing this with the compartment boundaries and stocked 
areas provided by Sino-Forest in the cluster-maps.  

Of the 66 compartments assessed, 39 had an area difference of less than 10% and 
55 had a difference of less than 20%. Compartments with a large negative 
difference generally result from the exclusion of non-forested patches within the 
compartments. Large positive differences are attributed to uncertainties concerning 
the locations of boundaries, i.e. where the boundaries do not follow natural 
topographic features such as ridges and rivers. The larger proportional differences 
are seen in smaller compartments since proportionally any changes in area have a 
greater impact. 

Over the 66 individual compartments compared (Sino-Forest's compartment 
records and Pöyry's audit), overall the area differences are negligible at 2% 
(1 611 ha versus 1 580 ha), although there was some variation at the compartment 
level.

In addition, there appears to be no bias in the Sino-Forest area data. Accordingly, 
no area adjustments have been made to Sino-Forest's area representation of the 
forest crop assets owned as at 31 December 2009.

It is important to understand that this is not a confirmation of forest ownership, but 
rather a verification of the mapped and recorded areas of stocked forest. 

The following table summarises information provided by Sino-Forest that describes 
the net stocked area by species or species group of its forest assets as at 
31 December 2009.

For the purposes of forest modelling, Pöyry has considered each of these species or 
species groups as a croptype and used an average yield table for each to represent 
expected growth and yield4 (see Section 4.4). 

In addition, Sino-Forest has advised Pöyry that it currently holds the land-use rights 
for a further 200 000 mu, or 13 330 ha of bareland that it will plant in the future. 
This land has not been considered in the forest management and cash flow 
modelling and does not impact on the value of the existing tree crops currently 
owned. Furthermore, Sino-Forest has advised Pöyry that it also owns a plantation 
forest of about 8 020 ha in area that is used specifically for research and 
development purposes. No details of this forest have been provided to Pöyry and it 
has not been considered in this valuation. 

4.4 Forest Yield  
Yield tables are used to predict how the volume of wood per unit area changes with 
age for a typical stand for each type of forest in Sino-Forest's estate. Ideally, yield 
tables would be available to cover the full range of species, site conditions, stand 
management and other factors that influence yield across a large forest estate like 
Sino-Forest's. Unlike the forest area component of the physical forest description, 
information on the forecast growth and yield of these forest crops, was not 
provided. As in previous years, Pöyry has applied yield tables that it has derived 
itself, and which are assumed to broadly apply to the Sino-Forest estate. Pöyry has 
applied certain tests of the reasonableness of these assumed yield tables based on a 
process described below.   

                                                 
 
4 Except for eucalypts where there are distinct yield tables for areas that Sino-Forest has planted, and areas that have 
been purchased.

This is an important difference in methodology versus valuations Pöyry undertakes 
in other regions such as Australia or New Zealand, where typically, detailed yield 
data and information are available covering the inherent variability of large forest 
estates.  

During Pöyry's field inspection of 2009/10, a total of 75 plots were established and 
measured. Thirty four were in broadleaf forest, 23 in planted eucalypt forest, 9 in 
'Other Species', and 9 in Chinese fir. The selection of this particular sample took 
into consideration the changes to Sino-Forest's estate in terms of the area, by 
location, species and age, between 2008 and 2009. 

Despite the limited number of new sample plots available, Pöyry opted to change 
one of the yield tables used in the 2008 valuation. The 'Other Species' yield table 
was modified to increase the estimated recoverable volume at age 20 from 
60 m3/ha to 90 m3/ha. The reason for this change  along with summary statistics of 
all the plot measurements, is provided in Appendix 5. 

In addition, Pöyry revised the broadleaf forest yield table as we became aware of a 
regulation that prohibits clearfelling in natural forest. Consequently, the assumed 
recoverable volume per unit area from applying a selection harvest regime, reduced 
the yield by 50%, from 181 m3/ha assumed in 2008, to 90  m3/ha for this year.  

Finally, while in the 2008 valuation, all eucalypt plantations in the company's 
estate were treated the same in terms of expected yield, in this year's valuation, 
Pöyry has made a separate yield forecast for eucalypt plantations that Sino-Forest 
has purchased. As a consequence, the yield from the 24 000 ha of purchased 
eucalypt forest is reduced on the assumption that growth rates in these forests is 
lower than that achieved by Sino-Forest in its own plantations. The company 
routinely applies genetic improvements and more intensive management than is 
typical in China. Pöyry's wood flow models assume these areas of purchased 
eucalypts are to be replanted (not coppiced) after harvesting, and that they then 
attain the same growth as the company's planted eucalypts.  

The yield tables used in the 2009 Sino-Forest valuation are shown in Figure 4-6 to 
Figure 4-12. The figures show projected recoverable volume per hectare, by log 
type and age for each of the major species the company owns. The legend indicates 
the log type or log grade. These are defined by small end diameter (sed) of the logs, 
and relate to the prices shown in Table 8-2.  

 2099 refers to an sed of > 20 cm 

 1420 refers to an sed of >14 to 20 cm 

 0614 refers to an sed of 6 to 14 cm.

In addition to the nine new inventory plots established for the 2009 valuation, 
Pöyry attempted to test the reasonableness of the Chinese fir yield table applied in 
this year's valuation, by triangulating between the limited number of sample plots 
established by Pöyry as part of previous years' valuation work and general Chinese 
fir growth data from other sources . Based on this somewhat limited test, Pöyry 
found no evidence to suggest that its 2008 yield table was biased. Consequently, 
this yield table has been left unchanged.

The yield table for foreign pine is the same as that applied in the 2008 valuation. 

There were only 87 ha of acacia species in the Sino-Forest estate as at 
31 December 2009. This species accounts for less than 0.02% of the total area of 
forest. Its yield is represented as a constant 63 m³/ha of pulp grade log from age 
6 years. This is the same as the yield table applied in the 2008 valuation. 

4.5 Statement on Yield Tables and Estimates of Growth and Yield  
In Pöyry's forest valuations in Australasia, the Americas, Africa and Europe, the 
forest owner or manager usually provides Pöyry with an area description and a 
yield description of the forest. These descriptions are typically in the form of tables 
of the stocked area and associated recoverable yield expectations, by species, 
location and age. 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  17 

Pöyry then spends some time during the field inspection phase of a valuation 
assignment verifying the reasonableness of these area and yield statements. The 
focus importantly, is on verification, in contrast to the generation or development 
of this forest description information.  

In the Sino-Forest valuation, while Sino-Forest does provide Pöyry with tables of 
the stocked area of forest owned as at valuation date, it does not provide inventory 
information or data useful for the description of forest yield.  

From the area description provided by Sino-Forest, Pöyry then selects where to 
focus its field inspections. The focus is typically on locations, species and age-
classes that in Pöyry's opinion will contribute most to the total forest value. Where 
there are significant new areas of forest in the estate, Pöyry will endeavour to visit 
these locations and species. 

As part of the field inspections, Sino-Forest provides maps of forest area and forest 
record information on species and age of the crops within these areas. GPS data is 
recorded in the field and later used in conjunction with the maps to compare areas 
of forest as mapped and recorded, against that independently assessed using 
satellite imagery. The existence of tree crops by species and age, as per the maps 
and forest records, are also verified as part of the field inspection process. 

In the absence of yield tables to verify, Pöyry has established a small number of 
inventory plots and measured Sino-Forest's tree crops in locations of interest. 
Using these data, collected over several years, Pöyry has developed a set of yield 
tables that broadly describe the average growth and yield of Sino-Forest estate. 
These are generic yield tables, by species. Pöyry does not claim that these broad-
based and generic yield tables adequately capture the full extent of variation in site 
and crop quality characteristics, nor in turn adequately reflect the true mean growth 
and yield that will be realised from the forest estate as a whole. While measures of 
precision of sample mean estimates suggest that the true mean yield of the whole 
forest, by species, is likely to be within +/-15% of the yields derived from the 
sample measurements, the fact remains that in comparison with most other forests, 
the large Sino-Forest estate is significantly under-sampled for growth and yield 
estimation purposes.

5 RISKS TO FOREST ASSETS 
In addition to risks relating to the cash flow assumptions there are other risks 
associated with management of a biological resource such as a forest. In the Sino-
Forest plantations the key identifiable risks include: 

 Fire 

 Snow/Frost 

 Pest and Disease 

 Storms and Typhoons 

5.1 Fire 
Fire has not been a major threat in South China plantation forests in the past. 
However, with the increase in eucalypt plantation area there is a correspondingly 
greater fire risk. This risk can be mitigated by the implementation of fire prevention 
techniques such as the construction of firebreaks inside plantations, the 
development of human resources trained in fire fighting and supported by physical 
infrastructure such as portable fire fighting equipment. Given that the resource is 
geographically fragmented and comprises discrete forest blocks that are generally 
less than 500 ha in size, the opportunity for a singular catastrophic event is remote. 

It is evident from Pöyry's previous field inspections of Sino-Forest's estate that in 
some regions farmers have used burning as a land preparation tool in the past. 
Sino-Forest has previously used fire to prepare land for planting but is moving 
away from this practice. Their aim is to reduce the loss of soil fertility that occurs 
when organic matter is volatilised and lost to the atmosphere. 

Recently established and young stands are at greatest risk to fire damage as they are 
more likely to suffer crown damage that compromises their growth. In older stands 
close to harvest age, the impact of fire may be less significant as much of the 
timber may be salvaged and marketed with little discount. 

Sino-Forest has advised Pöyry that it holds fire insurance cover, but Pöyry has not 
viewed the policies. 

5.2 Frost and Snow Damage 
The risk of frost damage can be reduced by careful attention to site selection. Frost 
prone sites should be avoided and planting should be scheduled to coincide with 
favourable weather conditions.  

Snow damage in southern provinces of China is expected to be a rare occurrence. 
However, an example of the extreme climate variations that are possible occurred 
in January 2008 when snowfalls in southern regions of China occurred, resulting in 
some forest damage across a number of southern provinces.

5.3 Typhoons 
The coastal areas of Southern China suffer a number of typhoons each season 
during July to September. The forest damage is generally localised and confined to 
young age-classes, but every 20 years or so a typhoon is likely to cause significant 
damage. The area that is most affected is within 200 km from the coast. The risk of 
typhoons for Sino-Forest's plantations is generally limited to some areas in 
Guangxi. This risk is reduced by the high stocking rates and short rotations of the 
eucalyptus plantations. 

The stands inspected in 2009 in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan and Hunan showed 
no notable damage from typhoon activity.  

5.4 Pests and Disease 
As the area of single species plantations increases so does the potential risk of pest 
and disease problems. To date there appears to have been no serious pest or disease 
outbreaks in either Sino-Forest's plantations or any others. Bacterial wilt caused by 
Ralstonia solanacearum, has caused some mortality in eucalypt nurseries and in the 
field in another owner's forests in Guangxi Province. A gall wasp Leptocybe invasa 
has also caused leaf malformation in these same forests. 

Bacterial wilt causes wilting, leaf drop, reduced growth and sometimes tree 
mortality. Seriously infected areas are treated by felling stems, sometimes 
removing the vegetative material, and replacing the soil in the planting holes. 
Attack by the gall wasp may be height related as trees over 2 metres in height 
appear to be less susceptible. The wasp injects its eggs into leaf tissue, which 
disrupts normal flows and physiology of the leaf, often resulting in the formation of 
galls. Although not a lot is known about the impact of the gall wasp, it is likely that 
photosynthesis and normal growth is affected.  

Leaf eating caterpillars are controlled by the application of pesticide if levels of 
infestation are such that 30% of the crown is affected. Local Forest Bureaus 
maintain disease control stations and provide forecasts on pathogen levels and the 
need for control. In keeping with good forest practices, Sino-Forest plants trees 
produced from a number of different clones; this reduces the risk of a weakness in 
any one clone being propagated throughout the plantations and provides genetic 
diversity. The clones that have been planted to date have been assessed for 
resistance against disease.

6 COSTS 
Forestry operations are those operations associated with the establishment and 
maintenance of the forest crop up until the time of harvest. Harvesting costs are 
covered in Section 6.2. 

6.1 Direct Costs of Forestry Operations 
The following table summarises the direct costs of forestry operations by main 
species. For eucalypts costs are shown for planted and coppiced rotations (see also 
Section 9.2 that discusses the assumed regeneration strategy).

The costs assumed to apply to the various tree crops in the Sino-Forest estate, as 
summarised in Table 6-1, were derived from a combination of Pöyry's in-house 
database and specific data obtained from interviews with Forest Bureaus as part of 
the field inspections. Overall, forestry costs have increased by just over 10% (in 
nominal terms) since 2008. 

Land preparation includes all costs of planning (design), site preparation and tree 
crop establishment, including clearing the land of debris to facilitate planting and 
tree growth, hole digging, planting of seedlings (or cuttings), setting base fertiliser, 
refilling holes and any other operations necessary. These operations and costs occur 
in the first year of the rotation, and before the trees are one year old. 



2BA12945

Crop maintenance and tending are post year 1 or post-establishment operations, 
typically occurring in years 2 and 3 of the rotation. They are ancillary to initial 
establishment and are essential to the effective establishment, development and 
vigorous growth of the tree crop. These operations and costs include the purchase 
and application of fertilisers, weeding and singling. 

Crop protection costs are those costs incurred to protect the tree crops from theft 
(illegal harvesting and theft of logs from the forest) and fire damage, including 
education and public relations, training in fire suppression, and fire risk monitoring. 
Other than for eucalypts, Pöyry has applied a standard cost of RMB2/mu/year, or 
RMB30/ha/year. In the case of eucalypts, there is the additional cost of forest 
health monitoring and pest control. Eucalypts have been found to be more 
susceptible pests and disease, such as bacterial wilt and wasp attack and require 
more intense health monitoring and remedial operations. Security, fire prevention 
and pest control costs in eucalypts amount to about RMB105/ha/year. 

Forestry costs have only a small impact on the market valuation which is confined 
to the cash flow arising only from the current crop. The highest forest operations 
costs are associated with land preparation and establishment and these operations 
are already complete insofar as the current crop is concerned. Some crop 
maintenance and tending costs are incurred in association with the current crop 
over the next three to four years, and the relatively small costs of crop protection 
are incurred until harvest. The small impact of direct forest operations costs on the 
market value of the forest crops is shown in Section 13, Sensitivity Analyses. The 
small impact of increased forestry operational costs this year can also be seen in the 
Change Analysis.  

6.2 Direct Costs of Harvesting and Cartage  
Direct harvesting and cartage costs are all of the direct costs incurred between the 
standing tree and delivery of the logs to the point of sale. In China, most harvesting 
operations are labour-intensive. Trees are typically felled by axe or handsaw, cut to 
length in the forest and then carried to the roadside by hand. The main cost 
elements are: 

 Tracking and road making for harvesting 
 Tree felling 
 Delimbing the fallen tree 
 Cutting the stem to log lengths in the forest (a typical length is 2 m length to 

facilitate hand carriage to the road. Chinese fir stems are often left longer, 
reflecting their lighter weight and some end-use in longer lengths). 

 Carriage to a truckable roadside (commonly by hand or a combination of 
carrying by hand and some in-forest cartage on trolleys or motor driven 
tractors) 

 Storage of logs 
 Debarking 
 Truck loading 



2BA12945

 Cartage of logs to the mill or other point of sale. 

As with the forestry operations, Pöyry obtained information on current harvesting 
costs during the field inspection process.  

Evidence suggests that during 2009, logging costs in southern China have increased 
by about 8%. Pöyry has assumed a 30% increase in the harvesting cost for 
broadleaf crops in Yunnan province as a result of this operation being a selective 
harvest rather than a clearfelling operation. Based on the information obtained from 
field inspections and data and information from other recent projects, Pöyry 
constructed the following generalised cost table for harvesting in the eight 
provinces containing Sino-Forest's current estate.   

Table 6-2:  
Logging Costs by Province and Species (December 2009)  

Province Species RMB/m3 Province Species RMB/m3

Jiangxi Broadleaf 141 Yunnan Chinese fir 105 
Jiangxi Chinese fir 95 Yunnan Masson Pine 151 
Jiangxi Masson Pine 135    

As stated above, the three provinces of Guangxi, Hunan and Yunnan together 
contain about 391 000 ha or about 80% of the total forest area of 491 000 ha. 
Guangxi and Hunan are similar in terms of land form and terrain. Logging costs are 
the same. Yunnan is more mountainous, and the distance for carriage of logs to a 
truckable road is typically greater than in Guangxi and Hunan. Accordingly, 
logging costs in Yunnan are higher. Logging costs in Guangdong and Jiangxi 
provinces are similar to those in Guangxi and Hunan. 

In addition to terrain and carriage distance, logging costs (from standing tree to 
logs at truckable road) vary on a per cubic metre basis with the green density of the 
logs, or weight per unit volume. Broadleaf species and 'Other Species' have the 
highest density, with the pines being lighter per cubic metre. These species are 
typically cut to lengths of about two metres so that they can physically be carried 
out of the forest by hand. Chinese fir is by far the lightest and is often carried in log 
lengths of up to 8 metres. It is easier than the other species to fell, delimb and carry. 
The cost of logging eucalypts is relatively low because these forests are much more 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  23 

intensively roaded and the carriage distances are quite short. Eucalypt forest land is 
also typically less steep and much easier to work on than the land carrying the other 
species.  

In Heilongjiang, Pöyry has applied a logging cost of RMB131/m3 to the 5 500 ha 
(1% of the total Sino-Forest estate). Although the area is remote, the terrain of the 
forest is reportedly easier than the hilly and mountainous forest areas of the 
southern provinces. A simple RMB10/m3 cost reduction was made to the 
RMB141/m3 applied in Guangxi and Hunan. 

When the unit costs presented in Table 6-2 are weighted by Sino-Forest's area of 
forest by province and species as at 31 December 2009, the result is an average 
logging cost of RMB123/m3. This compares with an area weighted average logging 
cost for the 2008 forest estate of RMB104/m3. This 18% increase is a reflection of 
the average 8% increase in cost over the past year, the increase applied to the now 
selective harvesting of the Yunnan broadleaf crops, and the new area composition 
of the 2009 forest estate.  

Among the potential effects of the global economic crisis in China is the likelihood 
of considerably more male labourers remaining in the rural villages in 2010. This 
could provide an increased supply of labourers for forestry work. In Pöyry's 
opinion, this may dampen the logging cost increases that might otherwise be 
expected. Accordingly, in the cash flow model, Pöyry has reduced the overall cost 
of logging from the new costs (see Table 6-2) by 10% in 2010, and 5% in 2011. 
(The impact of not applying this assumption is to reduce forest crop value by less 
than 1%). 

6.2.1 Harvest Roading Costs 
In this year's valuation, rather than assume that the forest is sold as stumpage, it is 
assumed that the forest is managed and harvested by the forest owner. Accordingly, 
a provision for harvest roading at RMB10/m3 harvested has been included in the 
harvest related costs.  

6.2.2 Cartage Costs 
As part of the 2008 valuation, historical cartage cost data from Pöyry's in-house 
database were adjusted to real costs as at 2008, based on China's published CPI, 
and plotted against cartage distance. The resulting cost curve (Figure 6-1) was 
benchmarked against five data points collected during the 2008 field inspection. 

The associated cost equation  

Cartage cost: RMB/m3/km = 9.240*one-way cartage distance (km)-0.548 

was then applied to assumed average cartage distances for the various provinces 
and, in the case of Guangdong, separately for eucalypt species.

No cartage cost data were obtained as part of the 2009 valuation While diesel costs 
to the consumer have risen by around 10% over the past year in China, the cost of 
diesel contributes less than one-third of the total cost of running a log cartage truck. 
Cartage costs are assumed to have increased by about 5% since 2008. 

Table 6-3 summarises the assumed average cartage distance from the forest to the 
point of sale, and the cartage costs applied in the forest estate model. The point of 
sale in every case is assumed to be at-mill-gate. The price point assumed in the 
derivation of log prices (see Section 8)), is also at-mill-gate.

In Pöyry's opinion, these are reasonable estimates of the average cartage distances 
(and costs) likely to apply to the cartage of logs from Sino-Forest's forest areas to 
market. As concentrated forest areas become due for harvest, wood processors are 
likely to establish processing plants near these resources. Sino-Forest itself is one 
organisation that is planning to establish plants to utilise such forest produce and 
reduce log cartage costs. Pöyry is also aware of other prospective participants in 
wood processing who are considering the same tactic.

6.3 Forestry Overheads and Indirect Costs 
In addition to direct costs, all businesses incur indirect costs. These costs are 
sometimes called overheads. Indirects or overheads are all those costs that are not 
direct labour or materials or are not easily associated with particular units of 
production.  

In the general management of the forest, units of production are usually areas 
(hectares) of forest that are treated in a specific way or undergo particular treatment 
operations. In the harvesting phase, they refer to the volume of logs that are 
harvested (cubic metres). 

Forestry businesses overheads are usually divided into those associated with the 
general management of the forest estate and related forestry operations, and those 
more closely connected to harvesting activity. 

Forestry overheads and indirect costs comprise two parts. These are the forest 
business management and administration cost of running the forestry business, and 
indirect costs associated with forestry operations. 

6.3.1 Forest Business Management and Administration Overhead Cost  
These are the total spend of the forest management business excluding all direct 
forestry operations costs, the cost of land rentals, and costs associated with 
harvesting and marketing activity. This provision is intended to cover the costs of: 

 All staff remuneration (corporate, management, administrative etc.) 

 Offices rental, power, telecommunications, and other expenses 

 Vehicle running 

 Information technology and software licenses etc. 

 Training 

 Research and development 

 External professional services e.g. legal, audit, other consultancies 

 Public relations and communications 

 Insurance 

 Repairs, maintenance and depreciation of assets 

 Memberships, levies and subscriptions. 

Pöyry has a considerable amount of experience in assessing forestry overhead costs 
in forest businesses around the world. As in last year's valuation, Pöyry has not 
obtained particular overhead costs for Sino-Forest's business but has considered a 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  26 

wider and generic estimate of the costs of running a forestry business of a similar 
size in New Zealand and Australia.  

This cost is related to the area of forest, although there are not always economies of 
scale. Pöyry has applied an annual overhead cost of RMB300/ha. This is the same 
as applied in the 2008 forest valuation, and is about 80% of the current cost in 
New Zealand and Australia. However, a significant proportion of the total cost is in 
staff remuneration and running offices. These are lower cost items in China.  

6.3.2 Indirect Costs associated with Forestry Operations 
Forestry operations are typically accompanied by supervision and quality control 
costs. As a provision for this, Pöyry has incorporated an 'on-cost' of 10% of the 
direct cost into the forest model. This is the same as applied in the 2008 forest 
valuation. 

6.4 Harvesting and Marketing Overheads and Indirect Costs 
Harvesting and marketing overheads are all of the harvest related costs that are not 
otherwise included in the direct costs. Harvesting taxes and fees are treated as an 
indirect because they are external impositions rather than direct costs.    

6.4.1 Harvesting and Marketing Overheads 
For a forestry business that is carrying out its own harvesting and marketing, there 
are associated overhead costs incurred. These cover the costs of: 

 Harvest planning and engineering (roads and landing) 

 Pre-harvest inventory 

 Supervision of the harvesting operation to ensure value recovery 

 Marketing, administrative and accounting costs associated with sales 

 Other costs of sale such as log volume / weight measurement, scaling etc. 

Pöyry has also undertaken a considerable amount of work in assessing harvesting 
and marketing overhead costs in forest businesses around the world. For a large 
business, with an annual log production over 1 million m3, these costs are typically 
in the range of USD2-7/m³, or about RMB15-50/m³. The range usually relates to 
the extent to which the company uses its logs internally or sells to other parties, and 
the degree to which they manage their own harvesting and marketing activity 
internally, as opposed to contracting out that function. 

Historically, Sino-Forest has generated its main revenue from the sale of stumpage 
(standing trees), and often associated land use rights that it has held. Increasingly 
however, Sino-Forest has sold 'stumpage' (the right to harvest the trees) and not 
the land use rights, and then undertaken the reforestation after the buyer of 
stumpage has harvested the tree crop. Sino-Forest has indicated to Pöyry that it 
intends to move into harvesting its own trees, and will progressively increase 
processing of the logs produced as well. 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  27 

In previous valuations, Pöyry has applied a 'Log Traders Margin' effectively as a 
proxy for harvesting and marketing overheads. This was applied at the rate of 5% 
of the gross log sales price. In this valuation, Pöyry has taken the view that 
because the scenario that is being modelled for the purposes of generating a wood 
flow and cash flow assumes a sale of the entire forest, and the ongoing 
management of that forest in the long-term, it is more appropriate to assume 
management of the harvesting operation by the forest owner. All this has meant is 
the replacement of the 5% of gross log sales price as a cost, with what Pöyry 
considers an appropriate harvesting and marketing overhead for a large forestry 
business in China. This has been applied at RMB20/m3. It has also meant the 
inclusion in direct harvest-related costs of RMB10/m3 for tracking and road making 
in support of harvesting operations. This total of RMB30/m3 (harvesting and 
marketing cost plus harvest roading cost) compares with an average of RMB35/m3 
applied as the 'Log Trader's Margin' in last year's valuation.  

6.4.2 Harvest Taxes and Fees 

Harvest Tax 

According to government policy document (Ministry of Finance PRC & State 
Forestry Administration PRC 2009(32)), this equates to a maximum of 10% of the 
log sales revenue. 

Pöyry's understanding is that log 'sales revenue' is of the 'First Sales Price' and 
that 'First Sales Price' means the log price at the forest gate or roadside and not at-
mill-gate. (The latter could mean a higher tax imposition simply because of higher 
log cartage costs).  

Each province and county is able to set its particular harvest tax rate at any level, 
up to the maximum of 10%. While tax rates vary from county to county, and 
between forests and forest owners, Pöyry has assumed and applied the maximum 
rate in the cash flow and valuation model. 

In addition, there are other fees payable to Forest Bureaus in relation to harvesting. 
These are: 

Harvest Inventory & Survey Fee 

A Harvest Inventory & Survey fee is charged by the third party/organisation that 
holds the Forest Inventory & Survey Qualification issued by the forest authority. 
This charge applies to the total standing volume (TSV) and ranges from RMB3/m3 
to RMB10/m3 of the inventory total standing volume.  

Pöyry has applied a standard Inventory and Survey fee of RMB6.5/m3. 
Accordingly, harvest taxes and fees within the model are 10% of roadside price 
plus RMB6.5/m3. 

The harvesting tax and fees applied in this year's valuation average RMB66/m3 as 
compared with last year's RMB52/m2. This is a 27% increase of the assumed cost.

7 LAND RENTALS (COST OF LAND USE) 
Sino-Forest pays for the land it uses for forestry purposes. These payments are in 
the form of annual rentals. Land rentals in China, as in other parts of the world, 
vary widely with the quality of the land and its uses. Some specialist forestry crops 
such as poplars and bio-fuel species can face rentals of more than 
RMB1 800/ha/year. Forestry crops typically face much lower land rentals.  

During Pöyry's field investigations in 2008, information was obtained on land 
rentals for eucalypts. These ranged from RMB15 to RMB90/mu/year, with an 
average of RMB25/mu/year (RMB375/ha/year). Other information obtained by 
Pöyry in early 2009 indicates a range of RMB13 to 29/mu/year 
(RMB195 to 435/ha/year), with an average of RMB325/ha/year being paid for 
eucalypt forest land in southern China. This equates to a mid-point of 
RMB350/ha/year from these two sources, for eucalypts. 

Pöyry's database and other information sought on land rentals for other species 
indicate a range of RMB13 to 21/mu/year. 

On the basis of about 20% of the Sino-Forest estate being in eucalypts, an area 
weighted average rental rate of RMB270/ha/year has been calculated.  

The company indicates a range of current rentals of RMB10 to 20/mu/year, or 
RMB150 to 300/ha/year, or a mid-point of RMB225/ha/year. 

Pöyry has applied a mid-point of the range of RMB225 to 270/ha/year, or 
RMB250/ha/year to all land in the cash flow and valuation model. This is the 
same land rental applied in the 2008 valuation, and nearly 70% greater than the 
annual land rental cost applied in the 2007 valuation. 

While some land rentals are pre-paid (acquired for the current rotation with the 
purchase of the tree crop), these pre-payments amount to a pre-payment for a land-
related asset. Ignoring land rentals in the cash flow would effectively over-estimate 
the value of the tree crop.

8 LOG MARKET AND PRICE OUTLOOK 

8.1 Supply and Demand 

8.1.1 Domestic Log Supply 
A series of floods in 1998 in China were blamed in large part on deforestation and 
uncontrolled harvesting programmes. It led to the central government significantly 
reducing timber harvests in natural forests and also increasing protection forests. 
Since then, the focus has shifted to plantation forests, and the total harvest has been 
on a gradual rise during the 2000s.  

China's current commercial and recoverable log production is estimated at 
100 million m³/a. Of that, softwood represents 64% (Figure 8-1). In addition, it is 
understood that a large quantity recovered from non-commercial log production 
also ends up in various industrial sectors. 

In the foreseeable future, there may be moderate increases of softwood log supply 
from plantation forests but the growth is partially offset by continuing declines in 
harvesting of natural forests. As such, China's domestic softwood log supply is 
forecast to remain relatively consistent or increase marginally.

8.1.2 Log Import 

Softwood 

China's softwood log imports have increased exponentially over the past decade 
driven by the country's strong economic growth and an overall shortage of 
domestic wood. Russia has been the predominant supplier of softwood logs into 
China. 

In 2009 China's softwood log import was approximately 20 million m³, 13% lower 
than the peak in 2007, but 9% higher than in 2008.

The decrease of log imports during 2008 reflected reduced volumes imported from 
Russia, which was triggered by the announcement of Russian log export tax rises, 
while the Chinese domestic demand also generally stabilised.  

As an alternative to importing logs, China's softwood lumber imports increased 
substantially during 2008. This eventual shift is expected to continue, as the cost of 
imported Russian logs keeps increasing. Such structural changes have already 
become evident in the related industries that, until recently, relied heavily upon 
Russian log supplies.  

Contrary to Russian supply, softwood log imports from New Zealand to China 
increased considerably during 2009 and were at a record high. As a result, 
New Zealand's share of China's softwood imports increased to 22% in 2009, 
compared to 5% in 2007 and 10% in 2008. Russia's share on the other hand 
decreased to 68% in 2009, compared to 91% in 2007 and 85% in 2008. This trend 
clearly indicates a partial shift from tightening Russian supply in favour of more 
New Zealand logs.

Figure 8-3 illustrates China's softwood log imports by district (port) during 2009. 
This highlights the significance of the two major Chinese inland districts for timber 
imports from Russia, Manzhouli and Harbin, handling the majority of China's 
timber imports from Russia. It also shows that Qingdao and Shanghai were the two 
key districts for the import of New Zealand logs, followed by Nanjing.

Presented below are China's hardwood log imports by origin. The volume has 
dropped notably since the peak in 2007, from 14 million m³ to 8 million m³ 
(2009e). While the volume from Russia decreased substantially, supplies from 
Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Gabon have been comparatively 
consistent, positioning as the largest three hardwood log suppliers into China today.

8.1.3 End-use Industry Development 
China's total domestic fibre demand, including non-industrial applications such as 
rural housing, mining, agriculture and fuel wood is currently estimated at 
400 million m3/year. Industrial uses represent some 40-50% of the total. 

As presented in Figure 8-5, China's industrial wood consumption as of 2009 was 
estimated to be 200 million m3, on a roundwood-equivalent (RWE) basis. Virtually 
all industries have contributed to the considerable growth experienced over the last 
decade.  

Sawlog and peeler log demand is generated by domestic production of lumber, 
plywood/veneer and blockboard products. China has faced significant shortages in 
domestically produced quality saw and peeler logs, especially after logging bans 
from natural forests, and therefore depends on imported logs.  

In addition, China has been unable to supply sufficient pulp fibre from its domestic 
sources to the pulp industry, and since 2006 has been a net importer of woodchip.

8.1.4 Demand Drivers 
China's economic growth in recent times has been phenomenal, averaging over 
9%/year over the last decade in terms of annual GDP growth. The country has 
become the largest wood products consumer in the Asia-Pacific region, and the 
production of almost all types of wood products in China has increased at an 
exceptional rate during this period.  

Continued urbanisation, massive government-led housing programmes, 
expectations of improved living standards, and the privatisation of the housing 
system have all been and will continue contributing to the strong construction 
activity. This has also driven expansion of the related manufacturing industries in 
China, supported by the continued growth in the domestic economy and rising 
household incomes.  

In addition, infrastructure investments by the government will continue to be 
substantial, leading to strong medium-term demand for wood. The Chinese 
Government announced in November 2008 an RMB4 trillion (USD586 billion) 
stimulus plan to spur expansion in the economy and help sustain growth following 
the global credit crunch.  

The country's economic growth is forecast to slow down after the significant 
period of expansion during the mid-2000s. The real GDP growth in 2008 was 9.0% 
and, affected by the global financial downturn, the growth in 2009 was expected to 
be around 8.4%. While the short-term outlook for 2010 and 2011 is more positive 
than the previous two years, the medium-term forecast after 2012 is a stabilisation 
at around 8%/year.

OUTLOOK

 

China's construction activity was an estimated 2.3 billion m2 in 2008 and, after a 
period of slowdown, is expected to reach 2.7 billion m²/year by 2015. Investments 
in Chinese mills, aided by government incentives, have also led to a considerable 
expansion in value-added processing, such as furniture and interior decoration 
manufacturing.  

China's interior decoration and furniture manufacturing industry has been 
expanding rapidly during the past decade, supported by construction industry 
growth, increasing household incomes and overall economic growth. China's 
interior decoration, furniture and flooring segments account for nearly 50% of the 
total lumber consumed in the country today. In particular, growth in the furniture 
export business has been the most significant, founded upon the country's cost 
competitiveness in manufacturing.  

Furniture/interior decoration manufacturing activity has been slow lately due to 
lower demand for finished products from export markets such as the US. However, 
in the longer term, the industry is forecast to continue growing at a steady rate 
albeit more slowly than experienced in the recent past. 

8.1.5 Market Outlook 
The Russian Government recently postponed once again the increase of log export 
duties by one year until 2011. Whether Russia still increases the log export tax as 
planned remains very uncertain at this stage and is difficult to predict. Given the 
current economic turmoil globally and regionally, it seems increasingly possible 
that no drastic change will take place, at least in the immediate future.  

However, the potentially affected industries that have traditionally relied upon 
Russian log supply have proactively been seeking solutions. This movement is 



2BA12945

leading to a new equilibrium of softwood log supply and demand in northern Asia, 
resulting in some major changes within the supply chain, as evidenced by the 
continued large reduction in Russian log imports into northern Asia during 2008 
and 2009.  

Furthermore, regardless of the tariff issues, increasing costs of production in Russia 
have started to have a measurable impact on supply into northern Asian markets 
and will continue to do so into the near future. It is Pöyry's view that China's 
softwood log imports peaked in 2007, after a decade of substantial increases that 
were fully supported by the country's strong economic growth.  

Going forward, the import of softwood logs from Russia will continue to decline as 
increasing production costs take effect. This Russian supply cost increase will 
result in other cost-competitive suppliers such as New Zealand being potentially in 
a more competitive position to increase their supply into these markets. 

The total softwood log supply in China is forecast to decrease gradually over the 
next decade, as imports of semi-processed or finished wood products increase over 
time. Despite the continued economic growth in China, this log supply outlook is 
effectively capped by realistic availability of raw material supply. The gap will 
eventually be filled by the increased import of processed products, utilisation of 
hardwood, and substitution from wood to non-wood.  

In terms of domestic timber supply, there will be some increases of softwood log 
supply from plantation forests but this is partially offset by continuing declines in 
harvesting of natural forests. As such, China's domestic softwood log supply is 
forecast to remain relatively consistent or increase moderately.  

Figure 8-7 presents Pöyry's outlook for China's total softwood industrial log 
supply over the next decade.

8.2 Historical Prices 
Figure 8-8 presents the development of imported softwood log prices from Russia 
and New Zealand into China, on a cost-and-freight (CNF) basis. 

The prices increased considerably between 2003 and 2008, driven primarily by 
continued demand growth in China and high ocean freight rates. However, the 
global financial downturn resulted in a sharp price decline in late 2008 and early 
2009. The government has since introduced significant financial stimulus plans, 
mainly in the domestic infrastructural areas, resulting in quick demand and price 
recovery, especially in the second half of 2009.  

The CNF prices for imported logs are expected to continue increasing in the short 
to medium term as the demand remains strong, whilst supply from Russia remains 
tight in conjunction with the anticipated tariff issues and rising costs.  

Figure 8-9 shows the development of domestic softwood log prices at several major 
wholesale markets.  

Typically, log prices in China vary greatly depending on region, species and size. 
Local log sales are conducted either by direct negotiation between seller and buyer, 
or through large central log wholesale markets.  

Domestic log prices are found to be broadly in line with the imported log price 
trend and are becoming increasingly internationalised. Indeed the domestic prices 
have been following a negative trend over the last two years, representing slower 
demand growth relative to the mid-2000s. However, the domestic prices did not 
deteriorate as significantly as imported log prices.

8.3 Price Outlook 

8.3.1 Approach 
Log market analysis constitutes an important part of the valuation process. An NPV 
valuation is, by definition, based on expected future cash flows. Pöyry's approach 
to price projection involves an examination of the underlying economic and market 
factors that influence log demand. This includes the following:  

 An analysis of key demand drivers such as construction activity.  

 An assessment of the likely implications of the forecast supply-demand 
balance. 

 An assessment of other essential variables. 

The approach also considers the following price factors:  

 Historical price trends: Historical log price trends are recognised as being 
relevant and instructive.  

 Current prices: The prices that are currently being obtained represent empirical 
evidence, and are used in generating near-term cash flow estimates.  

In forecasting China's domestic log prices, Pöyry analyses a series of factors that 
affect log demand and supply, production costs and competitive forces. In carrying 
out China domestic log price forecasting, an informed judgement on the Asia-
Pacific region's log price outlook is formed. This is primarily based on supply-
demand factors and the competitive environment. 

Figure 8-10 illustrates the multitude of factors influencing key log prices in the 
Asia-Pacific region which then ultimately affect domestic log price trends in China.

8.3.2 Log Price Outlook 
Presented in Table 8-1 is an overview of the key price-driving factors for the next 
five years.

Domestic

There will be increases of log supply from plantation 
forests but this is partially offset by continuing declines 
in harvesting of natural forests. Overall, China's 
domestic log supply is forecast to remain relatively 
consistent or increase moderately. 

Neutral 

Domestic 
demand 

Domestic fibre demand will continue to increase as the 
economy keeps growing, albeit at a slower rate than 
before. The short-term outlook is especially positive as 
the market is set to bounce back from the stagnated 
conditions caused by global financial downturn.  

Positive, especially in 
the short-medium 
term 

Cost of supply Transport costs may further increase as fuel prices in 
China are expected to rise. However, operational 
efficiency in logging and transportation can be improved 
through the introduction of more sophisticated systems.  

Neutral to slightly 
positive 

Imported log 
and woodchip 
prices 

Imported log prices are currently on a rise again after a 
considerable drop experienced in late 2008/early 2009. 
Strong demand factors support the short-medium term 
upward trend. 
Imported woodchip prices are presently under some 
downward pressure as the demand remains weak. The 
future trend will depend on the establishment of 
planned pulpmills in China (and Australia) and their 
fibre procurement.

China's log demand growth somewhat stagnated during 2009 affected by the global 
economic slowdown. The wood products export business in particular has suffered. 
Yearly-average log prices in China dropped by around 5% from 2008 to 2009.  

However, healthy demand growth is expected to resume during 2010, resulting in 
upward pressure on log prices. Although China's domestic roundwood removals 
will increase relative to previous years, this increase will not be sufficient to meet 
growing sawlog demand.  

While importing of industrial roundwood logs continues to fulfil domestic fibre 
demand, China's total log import volume is expected to start declining during the 
next decade. Proposed Russian log export tariffs will continue to affect the log 
supply dynamics in Asia. Furthermore, supply costs of the Russian imported logs 
are expected to increase as logging locations shift to more distant forests. This will 
drive up the prices of imported sawlogs which will also put upward pressure on 
domestic sawlog prices. 

Regulations on harvest levels amongst the South-east Asian suppliers will suppress 
the amount of tropical logs available in the next five years. In addition, various 
measures and regulations that will be implemented to support sustainable forestry 
in the tropical forest-supplying countries will lead to higher production costs in 
South-east Asian countries.  

Pulpwood demand is expected to increase in the next five years as a number of 
large mill development plans are implemented, putting upward pressure on pulplog 
prices. However, generally stagnant global pulp and woodchip prices will offset the 
opportunity for domestic pulplog prices to increase significantly in the future. 
Thus, pulpwood price increases are forecast to be less significant than sawlogs. 

As part of this valuation, log price information was gathered for the range of 
species currently owned by Sino-Forest. The sources of this information were 
interviews with log buyers and wood-using industries in Guangdong, Guangxi, 
Hunan and Yunnan, on-line log price information, and Pöyry's own China log price 
database.  

Based on the analysis described above, Pöyry has formed an opinion on the log 
price outlook. This is the basis of the prices applying in the future. This sees large 
sawlog grades increasing in price between 2009 and 2014 at 2-3%/year in real 
terms, medium-sized logs increasing at 1-2%/year and small (pulp) logs at around 
1.0%/year.  

Figure 8-11 illustrates how log prices have trended since 2006 and the price 
forecast that Pöyry has applied in the valuation model.

8.3.3 Prices applied in the Valuation Model 
Log prices used in the model are shown in Table 8-2 below. A comparison of the 
actual prices that applied in 2009 with those that were assumed in the 2008 
valuation model, show that on a simple overall average basis, actual 2009 prices 
were about 3.3% higher. This effectively means that during 2009, log prices did not 
decrease as significantly as envisaged in December 2008. Average long-run prices 
remain approximately the same, in absolute terms, as those applied in last year's 
valuation.

9 WOOD FLOW AND ALLOCATION MODEL 
The physical and financial descriptions of the forest, outlined above, are brought 
together in the form of input to the Forest Estate Model from which wood flows 
and cash flows are generated. The Forest Estate Model employs a linear 
programming formulation which allows constraints to be specified and applied to 
the management and harvest of the forest estate. These constraints include the 
specification of:  

 Minimum and maximum harvest ages by species 

 Replanting assumptions in terms of croptypes and expected future crop yields 

 Levels of harvest volume (or area), in total or by defined parts of the forest 
estate, by species and location and period, and, where appropriate, 

 The minimum and maximum volumes of particular log grades that can go to 
certain destinations.  

With every constraint added to or incorporated in the model, and the tighter or 
more demanding any particular constraint, the lower the value of the forest will be. 
This is simply because the 'optimal solution' is more constrained, and in turn 
lower. 

Constraints applied to the modelling of potential wood flow from the Sino-Forest 
estate are as follows:  

9.1 Minimum and Maximum Rotation Ages 
The following table shows the minimum and maximum rotation ages allowed, by 
species in the Forest Estate Model. A common approach is to allow a wide range of 
ages in the early period of the model, and then confine the range to one considered 
about the normal range for economic rotations of the various species. This allows 
reasonable flexibility to the model insofar as harvesting the various crops in the 
estate to meet the requirements of the other constraints.

Period 1 to 10 is from Jan-2010 to Dec 2019; period 11 to 60 is from Jan 2020 to Dec 2069. 

Almost 97% of the broadleaf forest is in Yunnan. The majority of that forest is 
mature i.e. currently 25 years of age or more, and theoretically ready for felling. 
The wide range allowed for the harvesting of this species is to allow retention of 
forest and permit its harvest over a long period according to other harvesting 
specifications listed below. 

9.2 Regeneration Assumptions 
The following table specifies the regeneration assumptions for each species 
including the TRV (m3/ha) at a nominal harvest age for the successive rotations. 
TRV is expected to increase with rotation as selection and tree improvement efforts 
improve the genetic quality of tree stocks established, and also as a result of 
improved forest management and silviculture.

The level of improvement in terms of TRV at the nominal rotation age is greater 
for those species grown on longer rotations, recognising the greater time for 
research and development to produce incremental gains and an assumed associated 
greater level of improvement. For example, it is likely that the level of 
improvement between generations will be greater for Chinese fir during a rotation 
of 20 years than for eucalypts over a 12 year replanting horizon (planted crops are 
regenerated for one rotation by coppicing). Coppice rotations of eucalypts (COP1 
and COP2) are likely to produce similar volumes per hectare as their planted parent 
crops. Subsequent rotations of both broadleaf and 'other species' crops are assumed 
to be naturally regenerated and likely to produce similar yields to the current crops. 

9.3 Harvesting Constraints 
The following table summarises the direct harvesting constraints applied in the 
model.

6 1 3 Period GUIZHOU < 550 000 
7 1 3 Period HEILIONGJIANG < 220 000 

Constraints 1 to 7 limit the annual harvest in periods 1, 2 and 3, to certain volumes. 
These volumes are 25% of the specific provinces Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) 
that is set to apply during the central government's current 11th Five-Year Plan. 
While this plan runs from 2006 to 2010, this constraint has been extended for a 
further two years beyond the end of 2010. This is intended to ensure during this 
early part of the model and wood flow, that Sino-Forest's share of the provincial 
AAC in any one year is (a) not greater than the AAC, and (b) no more than a 
reasonable share for any one large forestry organisation. Over these three periods 
of the model, the maximum percentage of any province's AAC modelled as cut by 
Sino-Forest is 25%. The average is 21%. 

9.4 Destinations and Allocation 
The model assumptions for the allowed destinations for various species and grades 
of logs are the same as in the 2008 valuation model. In each province two mill 
types are specified, one called 'Province-Sawmill (Generic)', and the other 
'Province-Pulpmill (Generic)'. Very small and small-sized logs are allowed to flow 
to the pulpmills, and medium and large sized logs to the sawmills, all at the log 
prices defined for the particular grade of log as specified in Table 8-2. No upper or 
lower limit of supply to any mill is specified, and cartage costs are purposely set so 
that the harvest by province will flow to destinations only within that province. 



2BA12945

The modelling software does permit precise specification of where wood, by 
species and grade, can and might flow. This can be achieved by specifying upper 
and lower volume limits by destination, and by varying the delivered log price 
and/or specifying the actual cartage cost by origin and destination. This level of 
sophistication has not been applied in the Sino-Forest model. Typically, in China 
there is a deficit in supply of logs. In addition, where there is an increase in the 
level of log supply, that is sustained, then commonly the wood processing 
investment that eventuates will see the average cartage distance and costs kept to a 
low level. The average cartage distances by province, as specified in Table 6-3, are 
considered realistic in terms of modelling likely average cartage cost and net 
stumpage for this valuation.  

9.5 Smoothing Constraints 
A large number of specific constraints were applied to control the wood flow. 
These ensured that: 

 From period 1 to 59, the annual harvest from the Yunnan broadleaf was non-
declining in volume terms. 

 Within each lustrum (five-year period) the total harvest volume in each year 
did not change. 

 Between periods 5 and 6, the total annual volume harvested could not increase 
or decrease by more than 50%, and that between subsequent lustra, e.g. periods 
10 to 11, 15 to 16, 20 to 21, and so on, the change in volume could not be more 
than 25%. 

 Within each lustrum there were limitations on the extent to which the annual 
harvest within each of the three major provinces (Hunan, Guangxi and 
Yunnan) could change. This is to avoid there being high levels of harvest in a 
particular province for one or a few years, and then very little or none for one 
or more years, i.e. some smoothing of the annual harvest, by province. 

 Within and between each lustrum there were limitations on the extent to which 
the annual harvest could vary by species so as to give some smoothing of the 
harvest by species, and avoid the situation where some species might be 
harvested in large volumes in some years and not in others. 

Both the harvesting and the smoothing constraints seek to ensure a sensible and 
practicable harvest of the forest in a manner that would allow reasonable 
management of harvesting resources and avoid any undesirable impact on the log 
market.

Because Sino-Forest's forest resource is relatively mature, with the capacity to 
produce a large harvest volume in the early periods, a high early harvest has been 
allowed. This is consistent with the modelling of wood flow allowed last year, 
although with the significantly increased area of forest owned and the increase in 
maturity of that forest, the levels of harvest are higher.  

While this valuation does not seek to model specifically what the current owner is 
doing or might be planning in terms of harvesting, Pöyry typically takes some 
leading from the current owner's recent performance and intentions insofar as 
modelling the near-term harvest from the forest. Over the past three years, Sino-
Forest has sold, as stumpage, 9.9 million m3 (2007), 10.1 million m3 (2008), and 
14.2 million m3 (2009), in total standing volume terms. Applying an average 
recoverable volume factor of 75% (from total standing to recoverable volume of 
saleable logs – the basis of Pöyry's wood flow and valuation), these volumes 
equate to around 7.4 million m3 (2007), 7.6 million m3 (2008), and 10.7 million m3 
(2009).  These levels of sales have all been from a smaller base of forest area 
owned than what is owned as at 31 December 2009. In Pöyry's opinion, the levels 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  49 

of harvest modelled in the first five years are achievable, in terms of market 
absorption, and harvesting and wood-processing capacity, assuming that the 
Chinese economy continues to grow at or near 8%/year in GDP. Pöyry believes 
that the harvesting strategy is one that a rational forest owner of the Sino-Forest 
estate might follow. 

This high early harvest reduces to a harvest rate that is constant in terms of the 
annual volume within each five-year period and restricted in the level of change 
between lustra. This embodies some level of smoothing of the harvest by species 
and by province.

10 DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW VALUATION 

10.1 Overview 
The diagram below illustrates the structure of the valuation model. Generation of 
the initial inputs (the wood flows) has been described in the previous section. These 
wood flows are then optimised in their delivery throughout the supply chain to the 
various end-use markets. Revenue is generated at each destination, the price point 
being delivered at mill gate (AMG). Harvesting and transport costs, annual forest 
management costs, indirect overhead costs and the net cost of land-use (rentals) are 
deducted from this revenue to give an operating margin. 

The linear programming model generates all of these costs streams, since their 
profile depends on the harvesting strategy and age-class structure of the forest. 

Figure 10-1:  
Schematic Illustration of the Forest Valuation Process 

 
10.2 Treatment of Taxation 

Astute forest investors are expected to prepare valuations on the basis of post-tax 
cash flows. However, in general the accessible information with which to interpret 
transaction evidence almost always excludes any evidence of the buyer's taxation 
position. Accordingly, when forest valuers have sought to derive implied discount 
rates, these have largely been based on pre-tax cash flows. This valuation has been 
based on real pre-tax cash flows to which Pöyry has applied what we consider an 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  51 

appropriate discount rate. This is to translate the pre-tax cash flow forecast into a 
net present value representative of the market value of the tree crop asset. 

10.3 Scope of the Analysis  
In this context, scope refers to the time span of the analysis. The forest estate 
modelling process can provide projections of cash flows far into the future. 
Providing the existing forest is replanted into productive croptypes, it would be 
possible to run the analysis indefinitely. Two alternatives are demonstrated in forest 
valuation: 

 Perpetual cash flows - the forest is modelled as an ongoing business, where 
stands are replanted as they are felled. All revenue and costs associated with 
the sustained venture are modelled in perpetuity. In practice, the model is 
extended to the point where, after the discounting process, incremental cash 
flows are effectively immaterial. A figure in the order of sixty years is not 
uncommon when modelling a large plantation resource. 

 Current rotation analysis - only the revenue and costs associated with the 
existing tree crop are included in the analysis. 

In general, Pöyry prefers to confine the valuation analysis to the current rotation. 
The justification for this approach is that future rotations, which include a degree of 
conjecture, are excluded from the analysis. The current rotation approach is 
especially compelling when future rotations appear either spectacularly profitable, 
or especially unprofitable. In either case it could be anticipated that some 
modifying influence would prevail. 

If subsequent rotations are unprofitable, the forest owner will look to contain costs 
and increase log prices. If there is no prospect of either, a rational investor will quit 
forest ownership. 

If subsequent rotations appear super-profitable, it can be anticipated that there will 
be competition for the underlying land and its price will increase. When charged 
with a higher land price, the profitability of the tree crop, and hence its value, will 
decline. 

The approach is consistent with wider business appraisal that generally seeks to 
confine the analysis to the current investment cycle, and thereby avoid unnecessary 
conjecture.  

10.4 Timing of Cash Flows 
Tree planting within the Sino-Forest estate most commonly takes place over the 
months February to April. By convention, stands are generally assumed to have 
been fully established by 30 June. The yield estimation process has generated 
yields that are projected to apply on the full anniversary of planting. Thus, for 
example, trees planted in 1990 were aged 19.5 years old on 01 January 2010,  will 
be 20 full years on 30 June 2010, and 20.5 years on 31 December 2010. The 
harvest of stands planted in 1990 during the first period of the model (01 January to 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  52 

31 December 2010) for example, generate yields from the particular 
species/croptype yield table as at age 20 years. While actual yields may be slightly 
less early in the year, they will be greater later in the year, and are assumed to 
average the mid-year yield table volume over the whole year.  

Cash flows are assumed to arise on average at mid-period. Accordingly, with the 
first period being the 12 months from 01 January to 31 December 2010, the mid 
period is 30 June 2010. The first period's net cash flow has therefore been 
discounted for 6 months or 0.5 years, from 30 June 2010 back to the valuation date 
of 31 December 2009. Period 2 is from 01 January to 31 December 2011. The 
mid-period is 31 June 2011. Accordingly, the period 2 net cash flow has been 
discounted for 1.5 years, period 3 for 2.5 years and so on. 

10.5 Date of Valuation 
The date of the valuation is 31 December 2009. Pöyry uses proprietary software 
that allows the isolation of both the cash flows arising from the current rotation and 
all future rotations at any point in the valuation horizon. The cash flows 
contributing to the Sino-Forest market valuation (current crop) arise during the 
27-year period beginning 01 January 2010 and ending 30 December 2036. In fact, 
95% of the market value derives from cash flows arising by 2018, and 99% by 
2024.

11 DISCOUNT RATE   
A valuation based on a Net Present Value (NPV) approach requires the 
identification of an appropriate discount rate.  In selecting the rates there are two 
broad approaches: 

 Deriving the discount rate from first principles. The most common expression 
of this approach turns first to the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). 
This recognises the costs of both debt and equity.  The cost of equity may be 
derived using a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) method. 

 A second approach is to derive implied discount rates from transaction 
evidence.  

11.1 Discount Rate derived from WACC/CAPM  
As part of the 31 December 2009 valuation of Sino-Forest's assets, Pöyry 
commissioned Associate Professor Alastair Marsden of Auckland UniServices 
Limited to prepare a report on the cost of capital for a generic forest investment 
located in China. Dr Marsden's full report is presented in Appendix 6. 

Dr Marsden's report dated 05 January 2010 applies a WACC/CAPM approach to 
determine the cost of capital. He has concluded that, depending on the modelling 
assumptions, a range of discount rates might be proposed for a forest-owning 
venture in China. His derived ranges of rates are shown in Table 11-1 and Table 
11-2. 

Table 11-1:  
Estimates of Real Post-Corporate tax WACC by Marsden*  

Chinese Corporate Tax Rate "Low" estimate "High" estimate 
Corporate tax rate = 25% 5.9% 9.6% 
Corporate tax rate = 15% 6.0% 9.7% 

*(denominated in USD for a generic forest asset in China) 

The formulation of WACC employed by Dr Marsden was associated with post-tax 
cash flows and includes the cost of debt. Dr Marsden also converted his estimate of 
nominal post-tax WACC to an 'equivalent" real pre-tax WACC through a simple 
transformation with appropriate qualification as shown in Table 11-2. 

Table 11-2:  
Estimates of Real Pre-Corporate tax WACC by Marsden* 

Chinese Corporate Tax Rate "Low" estimate "High" estimate 
Corporate tax rate = 25% 7.9% 12.8% 
Corporate tax rate = 15% 7.1% 11.4% 

*(denominated in USD for a generic forest asset in China) 

Dr Marsden's cost of capital estimates apply as at 09 December 2009. 

The standard corporate tax rate in China is 25%. However, this can be reduced to 
15% for qualified enterprises that are engaged in industries encouraged by the 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  54 

Chinese Government. Assuming the highest tax rate of 25%, Dr Marsden's pre-tax 
corporate WACC has a mid-point of slightly less than 10.5%. 

In his report, Dr Marsden mentions other (non-quantitative) factors relevant to the 
estimation of the cost of capital. In particular, he lists corporate governance, 
China's legal, institutional and bankruptcy laws and size of investment and its 
liquidity as factors that may warrant the application of a cost of capital at the upper 
end of his range. 

Dr Marsden recommends "(to the extent that such evidence is available) our 
estimates of the cost of capital for a Chinese forest entity be compared to implied 
discount rates based on transactional evidence for actual forest sales in the 
Chinese market." 

11.2 Implied Discount Rates 
Pöyry has very little implied discount rate data for China and other than sales and 
purchases that Sino-Forest itself has been party to, we are not aware of any major 
forest transactions in China in the past year. As the commercial plantation forest 
industry develops and forests are transacted, empirical evidence from which to 
derive implied discount rates is expected to arise.  

By comparison, in New Zealand and Australia analyses of implied discount rates 
has become a standard means for comparing transaction results and deriving 
discount rates to apply in forest valuation. In New Zealand, surveys of the discount 
rates employed by practitioners and their perceptions of the discount rates implied 
by recent transactions are also published.  

The Convenor of the Forest Valuation Working Group of the New Zealand Institute 
of Forestry, Associate Professor Bruce Manley has published a series of biennial 
surveys of the discount rates employed by practitioners active in New Zealand and 
Australia5. The trend in the rates canvassed by Dr Manley's surveys is 
demonstrated in Figure 11-1. As noted in the legend within the figure, it includes 
not only the valuers' perceptions of IDRs, but also the discount rates that the 
valuers routinely apply in forest valuation.  The broad correspondence between the 
IDR assessments and the applied discount rates is fundamentally sensible. It has 
become the increasing obligation of forest valuers to produce "market valuations" 
and a coincidence of the two forms of rate should therefore be expected. In some 
measure, all of the points are IDRs.  

                                                 
 
5 Surveys of discount rates have been reported in the NZ Journal of Forestry in 1997 [NZ Forestry 42(4):47], 1999 [NZ Journal 
of Forestry 44(3):39-40], 2001 [NZ Journal of Forestry 46(3):14-15], 2003 [NZ Journal of Forestry 48(3):29-31] , 2005 [NZ

Figure 11-1 suggests that implied discount rates have shown some decline over the 
last two surveys. Valuation practitioners have followed suit with the rates they are 
applying. The results of the 2009 survey were recently published in NZ Journal of 
Forestry 54(4):19-23]. These results support the general trend of a lowering 
discount rate applied to pre-tax cash flows, with the minimum, maximum and 
average reported all lower than in the 2007 survey. The average of the surveyed 
discount rates as applied to pre-tax cash flows was 9.0% in the 2007 survey, and 
8.6% in the 2009 survey. 

However, compared with New Zealand and Australia, commercial forestry activity 
and investment in southern China is relatively new and still developing. Forestry 
business and the valuation of forest crop assets face some challenges, including: 

 The reliability of forest descriptions 

 The accuracy of yield prediction 

 Achieving high growth rates in a consistent manner. 

It is Pöyry's opinion that, for many forest investors, investing in plantation forestry 
in China would be considered a riskier proposition than investing in the industry in 
Australia or New Zealand. 

11.3 Incorporating Risk in the Discount Rate 
If forest investment in China is at present perceived to be a more risky proposition 
than like activity in other international counterparts, the issue then becomes how to 
quantify this difference.  The textbook treatments of the subject make it clear that 
the discount rate cannot be regarded as a simple catch-all for any and all forms of 
perceived risk. As the discount rate may be a very blunt instrument in such a role, it 



2BA12945

is preferable instead to attempt to acknowledge risk in the development of the 
expected cash flows to which the discount rate is applied. However, despite this 
principle, standard practice by many potential purchasers is to load the discount 
rate where they feel unable to quantify all appropriate risks that should theoretically 
be reflected into the expected cash flows. 

Table 11-3, below is a qualitative comparison of the key forestry risk elements in 
China and Australasia.

Elements of the Forest Description, including recoverable yields 
(no reconciliation evidence available) and the area statement 
(largely because the Sino-Forest estate is such a dynamic one) 
are less certain. This is balanced somewhat by a positive future 
market outlook for logs with possibly some conservatism in the 
Pöyry log price forecast. 

Higher 

Political 
and 
Currency 
risk 

Investment in China is of great interest both internally and to 
foreign investors. Politics, society and the currency is strong and 
stable. There is still however some concerns and perceived risks 
on the part of foreigners especially insofar as land based assets 
are concerned, where exit could be prolonged, complex and 
uncertain.  

 Higher (but 
may reduce 
over the next 
few years)  

Stumpage 
price risk 

China's normal demand for wood fibre is strong and is expected to 
continue to grow. There is a supply deficit of logs. Log prices are 
high and appear quite strong and stable or increasing in real 
terms. Logging costs have been increased in this valuation, and 
brought into line with current actual costs. Accordingly, there is 
considered to be low stumpage risk. 

Lower 

Growth 
and Yield 
risk 

Pöyry is of the opinion that the yield tables underlying the wood 
flows and cash flows are reasonable. However, until there is a 
history of reconciliation there will be some uncertainty as to outturn 
in total recoverable volume and by log grade. 

Higher 

Land 
tenure 
risk 

Prospective investors in the forest crop would likely perceive this 
with some uncertainty, largely due to a lack of understanding of 
Chinese land tenure and land use rights. Chinese land ownership 
is complex and is seen as an impediment to investment. As a 
result the Chinese Government has embarked on a programme to 
clarify land ownership issues over the next five years. This is likely 
to result in greater clarity in terms of land tenure and reduce 
perceived risk. 

Slightly higher 
but likely to 
reduce over 
next few years. 

Physical 
or 
biological 
risk 

The risk of fire and forest losses in the plantation forests of 
southern China is considered to be lower than in Australasia. 
Unlike Australia and New Zealand, Southern China experiences its 
greatest rainfall during the summer months. The relatively small 
and discontinuous nature of the forests in China mean that in the 
event of a significant fire occurring, it is less likely that the area 
damaged would be extremely large. Climatic effect damage such 
as snow, wind, frost and heavy rainfall are not considered to be 
very different.  
China's geographic location renders it more susceptible to entry of 
pests and disease, although there are no reports of major forest 
problems or losses.

The challenge then becomes how to quantify the impact of these differences in risk 
elements in terms of the discount rate.  

11.4 Discount Rate applied in valuing the Sino-Forest Resource 
The range of rates suggested by the WACC/CAPM approach, at 7.1% to 12.8% is 
quite broad.  

Given the current application of discount rates in the range of 8.5% to 9.0% to pre-
tax cash flows in New Zealand, and the comparison of risk elements in Table 11-3, 
in Pöyry's judgement, an additional 2.5% to 3.0% would seem reasonable to apply 
to the Sino-Forest estate. This is also consistent with Dr Marsden's view that 'other 
factors' may warrant the application of a discount rate nearer the upper end of his 
estimates of the real pre-corporate tax WACC.  

Pöyry has chosen to apply a discount rate of 11.5% to the pre-tax cash flows 
forecast to arise from the management and harvest of the current crops of Sino-
Forest's forest estate.  In selecting such a rate we have been inclined to recognise 
that investors in forestry in China will inherently be taking a long term view, and 
do have grounds for cautious optimism on the forest industry's future there. The 
fundamental factors that affect forestry performance are favourable. Importantly 
too, the definition of market value for the forests requires that there be not just 
willing buyers, but also willing sellers. If the only purchase offers to be extended 
involved very high discount rates, we would expect that forests would not be 
willingly sold.  

A discount rate of 11.5% provides a margin of around 7.0% over Treasury Bond 
'risk-free' real rates that have prevailed in western economies over the past 
20 years.

12 VALUATION RESULTS 

12.1 Exchange Rate 
The cost and price data applied in the valuation is in Chinese Renminbi (RMB). 
The resulting cash flows generated from the forest estate wood flow and allocation 
model are also in RMB. 

For reporting, Pöyry has assumed a USD to RMB exchange rate of 6.81726. This is 
the published rate for 31 December 2009. 

12.2 Valuation as at 31 December 2009 
Pöyry has estimated the market value of the Sino-Forest tree crop assets as at 
31 December 2009 to be USD2 297.474 million. This is the net present value of 
the pre-tax cash flows arising from the future management and harvest of the 
existing forest crops during their current rotation. The valuation uses an 11.5% 
discount rate applied to real, pre-tax cash flows.  

Pöyry has also calculated the NPV of the cash flows from the forest estate 
assuming its regeneration after harvest and the continued use of the land for 
forestry. The underlying cash flow includes the costs of re-establishing and 
maintaining the plantation forests, and net revenues arising from their management 
and harvesting in perpetuity. This figure is USD2 128.806 million.  

This is not an estimate of the market value. The difference between the market 
value and this figure, i.e. –USD168.688 million is wholly prospective. It is 
associated with rotations of tree crops that, as at the date of the valuation, have not 
commenced. (See also Section 10.3 Scope of the Analysis). 

12.3 Merchantable Volume 
Table 12-1 summarises the merchantable standing volume of the existing Sino-
Forest plantations. Merchantable standing volume excludes: 

 Areas of broadleaf younger than 20 years 

 Areas of Chinese fir younger than 5 years 

 Areas of eucalypts younger than 2 years 

 Areas of pine younger than 5 years 

 Areas of 'other species' younger than 17 years.

 Total  468 843 62 006 366  

This total 'merchantable standing volume' of 62.0 million m³ in the forest is a 
notional figure. It includes the theoretical recoverable volume from the broadleaf 



2BA12945 
 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  60 

forest at 181 m3/ha. If that volume is reduced to 90 m3/ha, on the basis of the 
requirement that areas if this croptype cannot be clearfelled but rather have to be 
selectively logged, then the 62.0 million m3 figure will be reduced to 
54.7 million m3.  

There is no expectation of the 'merchantable standing volume' being realised 
through immediate harvesting. The total volume expected to be harvested from the 
forest and sold as logs, over the modelled management and harvest of the existing 
tree crops (current rotation only), that is, the model upon which the market 
valuation is based, is 67.5 million m³.

13 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
A sensitivity analysis has been conducted that addresses the main drivers of value 
within the current rotation valuation model. These are: 

 Discount rate and log price changes (in combination) 

 Changes in the level of fixed overhead costs 

 Changes in the costs of production (logging, loading and log cartage) 

 Changes in the level of land rentals 

 Changes in the level of forestry costs (to show that these are immaterial.)

The valuation result is most sensitive to log price with a 5% reduction in log price, 
causing a near 10% decrease in forest value, and vice versa. It is less sensitive to 
harvest costs, with a 10% increase in the combined cost of logging and cartage 
causing a 5% reduction in value, and vice versa. The valuation is largely insensitive 
to annual overhead costs and land rental costs, with increases of RMB100/ha/year 
in the cost of either item causing a 1% reduction in forest value. As discussed 
above and shown in Table 13-5, large changes in forestry direct costs have no 
material impact on the valuation.

14 SUMMARY OF VALUE CHANGE 
Changes to the physical nature of the asset as a result of growth, changes in the 
area and maturity of forest owned from sales and purchases, and forecast yield, 
combine to produce USD647 million, or 99% of the value increase. Changes in 
costs and log prices almost cancel each other out, with the majority of the balance 
of the value increase arising from a favourable change in the exchange rate, from 
RMB to USD, as at 31 December 2009.

Valuation Methodology

1 METHODOLOGY 

1.1 Outline of Valuation Methods 
Accompanying the global expansion in planted forests has been ongoing 
refinement of the processes employed in forest appraisal. 

Three main methods of appraisal are commonly distinguished. These are: 

1. Comparable sales  
2. Expectation value 
3. Cost  

If these methods are to be effectively utilised in forest valuation then all three of 
them generally require a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach1. A schematic 
representation of the relationship between the methods is shown in Figure 1-1.

The standing stock approach is the special case where the discounting period used in the DCF analysis is zero. 

1.2 Expectation Approach 
The Expectation approach invariably involves DCF analysis. It provides the Net 
Present Value of the future net revenue stream and is commonly referred to as the 
"Income" or "NPV" approach2. As the terminology implies, this approach involves 

                                                 
1 In this context, DCF is considered within its wider interpretation. This recognises that the timing of the receipt or 
outlay of funds must be considered. When applied rigorously, the cost approach involves compounding. This 
process is the inverse of discounting, and thereby falls within the scope of DCF. 
2 The list is not exhaustive. Other acronyms that may appear include PNW (Present Net Worth) and PW (Present 
Worth).  



 2BA12945 
 

Appendix 1

projecting the anticipated future net income stream, and then "discounting" this, at 
a suitable cost of capital, in order to acknowledge the lower economic value of 
delayed receipts.  

The Expectation approach may characteristically turn to a wide reference base 
when selecting the discount rate. A commonly applied practice is to derive a 
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). This distinguishes the distinct costs of 
debt and equity. The latter may be derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model 
(CAPM).    

1.3 Comparable Sales 
In principle, the most satisfactory basis for valuing forests is to turn to the evidence 
provided by sales transactions. 

In comparing transaction results it is necessary to consider which attributes 
influence the value of planted forests. Important factors may include: 

 Forest maturity 

 Species composition 

 Site productivity 

 Proximity to market 

 Forest terrain (and thereby harvesting system) 

 Silvicultural history 

 Land value. 

Each of these factors may have a significant effect on forest value. Other features 
may also be influential. These include the standard of roading infrastructure in the 
forest, and the risks arising from climatic factors and pathogenic agents. Forest size 
may also have an influence, although there may not be a consistent trend with 
changing forest area.  

When comparing forests and the prices paid for them, it is also necessary to 
consider the time at which an example sale took place. In the first instance, the 
timing is reflected in perceptions of current log prices and their anticipated future 
movement.  

Given the range of factors affecting forest value, it is unlikely that forests can be 
found that are closely similar to the forest to be valued. This is especially the case 
given that forest estate transactions are not, by nature particularly frequent. 
Achieving a forest-to-forest match is extremely unlikely, as it would require 
finding forests alike in all respects, including size. 

Forest appraisers commonly find that the one distillable parameter that can be most 
usefully extracted from transactions involving heterogeneous forest resources is the 
Implied Discount Rate (IDR). Derivation of the IDR involves developing a credible 



 2BA12945 
 

Appendix 1 

 
Copyright © Pöyry (Beijing) Consulting Company Limited  A1-3 

cash flow projection for each transacted forest, using the best information the 
analyst can obtain. This is then compared with the price actually paid for each 
resource. The discount rate at which the discounted cash flows match the purchase 
price is the IDR. 

IDR evidence from the wider transaction base can be applied to the cashflow 
projections for the forest being valued. 

The IDR offers a device by which differences in size, timing, markets, location, 
age-class, volume, operability and other relevant factors are recognised. Further, 
the approach also recognises that a useful method of arriving at a market 
comparable result is to employ the same procedure that market participants utilise 
in deriving and supporting their negotiating positions. For Asia Pacific forest 
resources, the most common method of negotiating transaction values involves 
DCF constructions.  

The manner in which Pöyry applies the Comparable Sales and Expectation 
approaches may at first impression appear to be similar. Both employ a DCF 
formulation and refer to estimates of future cash flows. This does not imply that 
they can or should be unquestioningly coalesced into a single method. There is 
sufficient difference between them that they can potentially lead to different results. 

1.3.1 Realisation Value of Current Standing Stock 
This method warrants distinct discussion because it has had historical application. 
It recognises the potential net realisation value of the current timber content of the 
forest if it were cut down immediately. A value is based on the merchantable 
content (or "standing stock") at the time of the valuation. It is therefore a special 
case within the Expectation approach. Because the forest is harvested immediately, 
the cash flow modelling is confined to a single period. No discounting is required 
to recognise the cost of capital. This value is both tangible and comparatively 
straightforward to calculate. It does however have obvious limitations: 

 For plantation forests, the timber realisation value of the stand may be very 
low for most of the rotation length. Despite this, the vendor will be mindful of 
the funds invested in each stand and are expected to seek some reimbursement. 

 By the final years of the characteristic rotation, the marginal rate of value 
growth of the standing stock becomes considerable. An informed and rational 
owner will recognise the economic opportunity associated with holding the 
growing trees rather than selling them. Only if the purchaser's offer matches 
the vendor's perception of economic opportunity cost can the vendor be 
indifferent as to whether to hold or sell. Inherently, therefore, the vendor's 
perspective is based not on the current timber content but instead on the future 
anticipated revenue. 

 For forest resources of significant size it is unlikely that the market could 
absorb all of the forest wood content at once without log prices being 
depressed.

The first effect leads to an unduly conservative valuation, while the third can lead 
to an overly optimistic result. It is unlikely that the two effects would exactly offset 
one another. Pöyry's preference in valuing forests is to avoid this method 
altogether, as it is unlikely to reflect either the buyer's or vendor's analysis.  

1.4 Cost Method 
There are different interpretations of the cost approach. A straightforward version 
takes the costs involved in acquiring or establishing and maintaining the forest and 
accumulates these with compound interest from the inception of the investment to 
the current point in time. The forest value is therefore the price that forest owners 
would have to receive if they were to obtain a satisfactory rate of return on their 
investment to date. The method is equivalent to the accountants' concept of 
"capitalising" establishment/acquisition costs plus interest, although the forest 
valuer is more inclined to adopt assumed costs which are "standard" and current at 
the time of the valuation. 

By using costs that are current, along with a "real" (inflation-corrected) 
compounding rate, the valuation is updated for inflation. The use of "industry 
standard" costs ensures that only costs consistent with efficient practice are 
recognised. Forest valuers are wary of the compounding approach, and likewise 
capitalisation. In the market place a "high cost" forest does not necessarily prove to 
be a "high value" forest and yet this is what the method implies. 

1.5 Valuation Process 
The process followed in deriving a value for Sino-Forest's tree crop is illustrated in 
Figure 1-2. The first stage of the valuation process involves assembling a 
comprehensive "description" of the forest. Key components of this include a land 
area summary and information on the growth potential of the tree crop.

At the heart of modern forest management is a forest estate modelling system that 
employs a linear programming formulation to derive a credible harvesting strategy.  
This technology enables the collective resource to be modelled to meet various 
aims, including resource level constraints as well as the supply of various forest 
products into their end-use markets. 

Following confirmation that the results of the forest estate modelling process are 
managerially workable, the generation of wood flows and the allocation of products 
to markets enables the derivation of cash flows upon which a DCF valuation can be 
based. Application of the discount rate to these cash flows produces a present value 
for the tree crop. The responsiveness of this valuation to changes in the input

variables can then be tested with a variety of sensitivity analyses so as to derive a 
spread of potential tree crop values. This will indicate how sensitive the model is to 
changes in key inputs.  

1.6 Other Aspects of the Valuation Process  
In applying the DCF approaches, the following aspects also require consideration: 

 Analysis of pre-tax or post-tax cash flows 

 The period of analysis 

 Terminal value 

 Harvesting strategy 

These aspects are discussed in more detail below. 

1.6.1 Analysis of Pre-tax or Post-tax Cash Flows 
Both approaches have been demonstrated in valuing planted forests. For cash flows 
derived on a pre-tax basis a pre-tax discount rate is applied. Post-tax cash flows 
should be discounted at a post-tax discount rate. If the discount rates have been 
consistently derived, either approach should lead to the same tree crop value. 

1.6.2 The Period of Analysis 
Wood flows and associated cash flows may be modelled on a perpetual basis or 
they may be confined to the current rotation. 

Forest estate models have come to be an integral part of the forest valuation 
process, being applied to identify the forest's long-term supply capability. Despite 
this extended wood flow-modelling horizon, there has been a general tendency to 
confine the scope of the financial analysis to those cash flows solely associated 
with the tree crop that currently exists. This includes all parts of the present forest 
from the oldest stands to those just established. It excludes, however, trees that are 
yet to be planted as these are considered to be part of a new investment cycle.  

Wider business appraisal practice encourages the confinement of the scope of DCF 
analysis to the current investment cycle. There are arguments that forest valuation 
should be no different. The practice of considering the performance of the existing 
tree crop alone lies with the general preference for avoiding unnecessary conjecture 
associated with costs, yields, anticipated revenues and the future discount rate. 

As generally applied, the current rotation model is not to be confused with a 
"liquidation" or "realisation" model. Instead, the harvesting strategy for the current 
tree crop is assumed to be consistent with a long-term sustainable management 
policy, and although there will be future rotations, they will not contribute to the 
net present value calculation, i.e. they are "NPV neutral". In effect, all funds 
invested in them are assumed to earn such proceeds that the investment generates 
exactly the discount rate. 



 2BA12945 
 

Appendix 1

The current rotation model effectively assumes that through adaptive management 
the forest owners will seek to secure at least NPV neutrality on their reinvestment 
in succeeding rotations. 

Pöyry finds that the current rotation model is widely applied. Furthermore the 
IAS41 standard encourages this approach stating: 

"The objective of a calculation of net present value of expected cash 
flows is to determine the fair value of a biological asset in its present 
location and condition" (paragraph 21) 

"An entity does not include any cash flows for financing the assets, 
taxation, or re-establishing biological assets after harvest (for example, 
the cost of replanting trees in a plantation forest after harvest)." 
(paragraph 22) 

This does not suggest that this places the matter beyond scrutiny. In some locations 
the approach has found initial application in an environment where log prices have 
been high. Second and subsequent rotations, which included the expectation of 
continuing firm log prices, led in many situations to a net addition to the first 
rotation's NPV. In those circumstances, confining the valuation to the current 
rotation represented some conservatism. 

With log prices having softened, and a greater uncertainty surrounding the 
prospects of real price growth, current rotation models are now tending to provide 
higher valuations than their perpetual equivalents, if the discount rate is unchanged. 
It may be too simplistic to assume that future rotations can indeed be made "NPV-
neutral". Certainly, it may be more straightforward with some forests than others to 
achieve the improvement in performance required. It would seem intuitively 
reasonable that those forests whose next rotation may be very hard to make 
profitable should be valued at a lower level than those which require little adaptive 
management. While Pöyry would prefer to incorporate some recognition of this 
effect in the valuation method, it is not considered that the market's treatment of it 
is adequately handled by simply turning to a perpetual model.  

Pöyry expects that forest valuers will continue to consider the relative suitability of 
current-rotation and perpetual models. Refinements to the methodology may 
necessarily await the availability of more empirical transaction data. 

Within the valuation of Sino-Forest's tree crop Pöyry has modelled the resource 
over multiple rotations in order to reflect the long-term management outlook of the 
estate. However, the market value estimate is clearly based solely on the cash flows 
arising from the management and harvest of the existing tree crop and the current 
rotation of those trees.

Field Inspection – Planted Forests

Appendix 2

1 PLANTATION MANAGEMENT 
The majority of Sino-Forest's estate comprises forest that the company has 
purchased, with about 11% being forest that has been planted by the company 
itself. So far, the focus of plantation establishment has been on fast-growing 
eucalypts (Eucalyptus grandis and grandis x urophylla) in Guangdong and 
Guangxi provinces. These eucalypts comprise nearly 95% of the 54 000 ha of 
planted forest. In addition, some 3 000 ha of Chinese fir and slash pine (Pinus 
elliottii) has been planted by the company, all of which is in Hunan province. 

As part of the field inspections in 2008/2009, Pöyry visited, assessed and measured 
planted eucalypts in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The yield table applied to 
planted eucalypts in the 2008 and 2009 valuations was developed from these 
measurements and estimates of stand volume across a number sites and tree crop 
ages. 

As part of the field inspections of 2009/2010, Pöyry visited and assessed plantation 
operations in Heyuan city in Guangdong province, a location that was not assessed 
in 2008/2009. 

In Heyuan, Sino-Forest owns and operates a tissue culture laboratory and a tree 
nursery. Here, both operational and research activities are undertaken, to develop, 
replicate and grow planting stock for use in planting and replanting operations in 
Sino-Forest's plantations. The underlying vegetative stock for the eucalyptus tissue 
culture operation comes from 50 superior trees, selected from three provinces in 
southern China. 

Modern controlled propagation and tending techniques are applied in the tissue 
culture and nursery operations, with tree stocks usually transferred to the field for 
planting within six months of their replication as tissue plantlets. During this year's 
field inspection of Sino-Forest's plantations, Pöyry: 

1. Observed a recently planted stand of eucalypts that had been established at 
about 1 450 stems/ha. While the trees were young and still small, the 
establishment seemed to have been successful and well managed. The site had 
been well prepared, incorporating some mechanical cultivation. The majority 
of young trees were well spaced and alive. 

2. Observed a fertilising operation in a slightly older stand. This was the second 
follow-up fertilising (i.e. the second fertilising after the base fertilising at time 
of planting) at crop age of nine months. The operation in progress appeared 
orderly and controlled. 

3. Established and measured 23 plots in four separate stands of eucalypts. These 
stands ranged in age from two to five years. Calculations of standing volume, 
with an average from the seven plots at age five years of 260 m3/ha, indicate 
very impressive growth. Measured plot volumes, translated to total recoverable 
volume (TRV m3/ha) using an 80% recovery factor, are shown in Figure 1 
below. Also shown are last year's plot measurements, the current valuation 
yield table for planted eucalypts, and the yield table applied in the 2007 
valuation. All are in TRV (m3/ha) terms.

1 YUNNAN BROADLEAF 

1.1 Introduction 
Pöyry undertook a field inspection of the Sino-Forest's purchased (mixed-natural) 
forest estate in Yunnan Province between 12 and 17 December 2009.  

Over this period, a two-person Pöyry team, accompanied by Sino-Forest staff, 
inspected several mixed-natural forest areas owned by Sino-Forest. Data and 
information were gathered relating to the local and regional natural forestry 
industry. 

Pöyry visited eight selected Sino-Forest compartments in total, spanning two 
counties and four towns. Thirty-four inventory plots were established in natural 
broadleaf forests, ranging in age (majority crop) from young to over-mature. The 
majority of the natural forest was dominated by 25–40 year old age-classes. The 
inspections and inventory provided Pöyry with both qualitative and quantitative 
data and information for use in the 2009 valuation. This includes estimates of the 
total standing and recoverable volume of the natural broadleaf forest within the 
estate, supporting estimation of growth and yield. 

The methodology applied in gathering the above qualitative and quantitative data is 
described in following sections. 

1.2 Inventory 

Overview 

The inventory focussed on assessing the current condition, standing volume and 
likely recoverable volume of existing natural broadleaf forest throughout surveyed 
areas.  

The field inspection covered two of the largest counties by Sino-Forest ownership 
in Yunnan Province.  

The selection of broad geographic locations in which inventory was undertaken 
was made by Pöyry based on area, species, and age-class distribution data received 
from Sino-Forest. Sets of 'cluster-maps' (maps providing latitude-longitude co-
ordinate points surrounding the company's acquired forest compartments) were 
then used to select one or two compartments for surveying and inventory within 
each cluster-map area visited. Each cluster-map area typically included 
3-7 individual forest compartments. Pöyry staff determined which cluster maps to 
survey, and which compartments to survey within each cluster map. An important 
determining factor in selecting a compartment was the need to cover a range of 
age-classes and sites across the surveyed Sino-Forest areas.  

Three to four individual plots were established within each surveyed compartment, 
depending on time and access constraints. 



2BA12945 
 

Appendix 3

In order to ensure a reasonable representation of the crops assessed, some plots 
were located close to access roads and others at some distance. Plot centres were 
typically located a set number of paces (50 to 200) from a particular point. This 
ensured that the crop and land characteristics at the final plot centre location were 
random without being biased towards areas that are easy to measure. At each plot 
centre, circular plots of 200 m² in area (0.02 ha) were established. The following 
information was recorded at each plot:  

 Date and time  
 Location - county/town  
 Compartment number 
 Plot number 
 Waypoint 
 Average slope  
 Plot size and corresponding adjusted radius  
 Altitude  
 GPS coordinates 
 Spacing  
 Age-class of the compartment,  
 Comments on general site and growth conditions, etc.  

Within each plot, all diameters (at breast height of 1.3 m) of trees larger than 
5.0 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were measured. 

In addition, three or more trees (where applicable) were measured for total tree 
height within or immediately bordering the plot, with these trees representing the 
range of diameters in the plot. 

1.2.1 Data Analysis 
The field inventory data analysis is briefly described as follows: 

1. Diameter and height measurements from Pöyry's field inventory were used to 
produce diameter-height relationships for each surveyed town (aggregation to 
this geographic level produced results of satisfactory statistical significance) 
using linear regression analysis. 

2. These regression equations were then used to estimate heights for trees that 
were not measured for height.  

3. Total standing (tree) volume (TSV) was then calculated using tree height and 
diameter measurements, and application of a generic natural broadleaf tree 
volume equation. Resulting TSV data were compared with the existing 
broadleaf yield table for the Sino-Forest estate.

3 GUANGXI - OTHER SPECIES 

3.1 Introduction 
Pöyry undertook a field inspection of a sample of Sino-Forest's purchased 'other 
species' forest type in north-eastern Guangxi province, on 14 and 15 December 
2009.  

Over this period, a two-person Pöyry team, accompanied by Sino-Forest staff, 
inspected two forest areas owned by Sino-Forest. Data and information were also 
gathered relating to the local and regional forestry industry. 

Nine inventory plots were established in mature 'other species' forest. The 
dominant species of this forest type is oak, with schima1 and Masson pine as 
significant secondary species (see table below). The inspections and inventory 
provided Pöyry with both qualitative and quantitative data and information for use 
in the 2009 valuation. The yield table for 'other species' was revised for the 2009 
valuation. This is described in Appendix 5.

Overview 

The inventory focussed on assessing the current condition, standing volume and 
likely recoverable volume of the 'other species' forest throughout surveyed areas.  

The geographic locations of several separate groups (cluster-maps) of Sino-Forest 
owned compartments were selected by Pöyry, using information provided by the 
company. Pöyry's focus was on areas of mature forest. 

The first plot within each area was located about 50 m into the stand, with the plot 
centre being systematically located at the end of a 30 m length of tape. Subsequent

plots were randomly located throughout the stand, again with the plot centre being 
located at the end of a 30 m length of tape. The following information was recorded 
at each plot:  

 Date and time  
 Location - county/town  
 Compartment number 
 Plot number 
 Waypoint 
 Average slope  
 Plot size and corresponding adjusted radius  
 Altitude  
 GPS coordinates 
 Age-class of the compartment,  
 Comments on general site and growth conditions, etc.  

Within each plot all diameters (at breast height of 1.3 m) of trees larger than 5.0 cm 
diameter at breast height (DBH) were measured. 

In addition, five or more trees were measured for total tree height within or 
immediately bordering the plot, with these trees representing the range of diameters 
in the plot. 

3.2.1 Data Analysis 
The field inventory data analysis is briefly described as follows: 

1. Diameter and height measurements from Pöyry's field inventory were used to 
produce a diameter-height relationship for all of the plots, using linear 
regression analysis. 

2. The regression equation was then used to estimate heights for plot trees with 
no actual height measurements.  

3. Total standing tree volume (TSV) was then calculated using these height and 
diameter data, and application of a generic broadleaf tree volume equation (the 
broadleaf equation was used as there is no specific equation for 'other 
species').

5 HUNAN CHINESE FIR 

5.1 Introduction 
Pöyry undertook a field inspection a sample of Sino-Forest's purchased Chinese fir 
forest type in Hunan on 17 and 18 December 2009.  

One consultant from Pöyry, accompanied by Sino-Forest staff, inspected three 
forest compartments of Chinese fir owned by Sino-Forest. Data and information 
were also gathered relating to the local and regional forestry industry. 

Nine inventory plots were established in this semi-mature and mature Chinese fir 
forest.  

5.2 Inventory 

Overview 

The inventory focussed on assessing the current condition, standing volume and 
likely recoverable volume of the Chinese fir forest in the surveyed areas.  

The geographic locations of several separate groups (cluster-maps) of Sino-Forest 
owned compartments were selected by Pöyry using information provided by the 
company. Pöyry's focus was on areas of semi-mature and mature forest. 

The first plot within each area was located about 50 m into the stand, with the plot 
centre being systematically located at the end of a 30 m length of tape. Subsequent 
plots were randomly located throughout the stand, again with the plot centre being 
located at the end of a 30 m length of tape. The following information was recorded 
at each plot:  

 Date and time  
 Location - county/town  
 Compartment number 
 Plot number 
 Waypoint 
 Average slope  
 Plot size and corresponding adjusted radius  
 Altitude  
 GPS coordinates 
 Age-class of the compartment,  
 Comments on general site and growth conditions, etc.  

Within each plot all diameters (at breast height of 1.3 m) of trees larger than 5.0 cm 
diameter at breast height (DBH) were measured.

In addition, between seven and 11 trees were measured for total tree height within 
or immediately bordering the plot, with these trees representing the range of 
diameters in the plot. 

5.2.1 Data Analysis 
The field inventory data analysis is briefly described as follows: 

1. Diameter and height measurements from Pöyry's field inventory were used to 
produce diameter-height relationships for each age-class using linear 
regression analysis. 

2. These regression equations were then used to estimate heights for plot trees 
with no actual height measurements.  

3. Total standing tree volume (TSV) was then calculated using these height and 
diameter data, and application of a Chinese fir volume equation.  

The analyses of these data indicated that estimates of the mean recoverable volume 
per ha on age were close to recoverable volumes of the average generic yield table 
for Chinese fir. Accordingly, no adjustments were made to the yield table applied 
in the valuation, see Appendix 5.

1 INTTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this work was to provide independent verification of the extent of 
Sino-Forest's forest estate.  

The assessment uses a selection of Sino-Forest's hand-drawn maps which represent 
66 compartments (1 611 ha), equivalent to a 0.3% sample of Sino-Forest's forest 
estate. Maps were registered in the GIS using coordinates provided, and the stands 
were digitised and overlaid on satellite data. Images of varying resolution, spanning 
the years 2008 and 2009 were used to verify that the plantation was stocked, the 
extent and shape of the plantation was correctly mapped, and the stated area was 
correct. 

The results confirm that the selected maps were produced to a high standard. No 
area adjustments are deemed necessary as the area differences over the 1 604 ha 
assessed were relatively negligible, at 1.9%, or 31 ha. This difference is attributed 
to the identification and exclusion of non-forested patches within compartments.

2 SAMPLE LOCATION 
Sino-Forest provided 18 hand-drawn maps with bounding coordinates of selected 
forest resources covering counties in Yunnan, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces in 
southern China.   

3 AREA VERIFICATION  
Plantation areas were verified using recent satellite imagery. Images were obtained 
that met the requirements of being cloud-free, having a relatively high pixel 
resolution, and data capture occurring between 2008 and 2009.  

The imagery acquired consisted of six cloud-free, high-resolution ASTER scenes 
(15 m pixel size) captured between  February 2008 and December 2009, and nine 
Landsat 7 scenes (30 m pixel resolution) dating mostly from late 2009. No recent 
cloud-free ASTER scenes were available for four areas, but coverage for them was 
obtained from the Landsat imagery.  

The Landsat 7 data has spectral bands that make it suitable for detection of forest 
change such as harvesting events, but it has the drawback of having stripes of 
missing data resulting from an historical instrument failure event. Where possible, 
the stripes were filled with other Landsat data of a similar date.  

Overlapping images were registered to within one pixel of each other. False-colour 
composites were then prepared to distinguish areas of forest (shown in green) from 
non-forest (in pink or mauve). 

The verification process involved five stages: 

 Registering the scan maps into a GIS using the coordinates provided 

 Adjusting the locations of the registered scan maps using suitable control 
points (e.g. river confluences and intersections of ridge lines) to ensure 
coincidence with the satellite imagery. 

 Transfer of the hand-drawn forest compartment maps to the GIS using manual 
digitising. 

 Cross checking and adjustment of compartment boundaries using the 
high-resolution imagery if necessary. 

 Excluding any non-forest areas within compartments identified from the 
imagery.  

An example of the output from this process is provided in Figure 1. The original 
hand-drawn map is compared here against a higher-resolution ASTER image and 
lower-resolution Landsat 7 image. In the original scan map, the corrected 
compartment boundaries (in purple) have been superimposed on the hand-drawn 
boundaries (in red).

4 AREA STATEMENT SUMMARY 
A comparative analysis between Sino-Forest's compartment records and Pöyry's 
audit conducted over 66 individual compartments indicated that overall the area 
differences are negligible at -1.92 % (1 611 ha versus 1 580 ha), although there was 
some variation at the compartment level (Table 1). 

 Of the 66 compartments assessed, 39 had an area difference of less than 10% and 
55 had a difference of less than 20%. Compartments with a large negative 
difference generally result from the exclusion of non-forested patches within the 
compartments. Large positive differences are attributed to uncertainties concerning 
the locations of boundaries, i.e. where the boundaries don't follow natural 
topographic features such as ridges and rivers. The larger differences are seen in 
smaller compartments since proportionally any changes in area have a greater 
impact. 

The sample mean for the percentage differences is 2.451% with a standard 
deviation is 23.433.  

The confidence interval for the population percentage difference is obtained from 
the formula: 

sample mean ± confidence coefficient x standard error 

The confidence coefficient is estimated from the student's t distribution,  t n-1,1-α/2   

For a 95% confidence interval, α = 0.05 and t 66-1, 1-0.5/2 = t 65,0.975 =  1.998 

The standard error of the mean = standard deviation/√sample size = 2.884  

The confidence interval is therefore 2.451± 1.998 x 2.884 = 2.451 ±  5.762.  

Based on the analysis presented here, one can therefore be 95% confident that the 
Sino-Forest areas determinations will lie between -3.311% less than to 8.213% 
more than those of Pöyry. For example, a planted area estimated by Sino-Forest to 
be 20 ha is expected by Pöyry to lie between  18.36 ha and 20.66 ha 95% of the 
time. This assumes that the quality and accuracy of the mapping is the same as for 
the analysed sample.

CHANGES TO LOG YIELD FORECASTS (YIELD TABLES) IN 2009 VALUATION 

1 OTHER SPECIES CROPTYPE 
In the 2008 valuation, the area of 'Other Species' was approximately 62 000 ha. 
Pöyry estimated the average TRV at 60 m3/ha, with this volume constant from age 
17 years onwards. The TRV was distributed across the log size classes with about 
one-third each in the two smallest classes, and the balance evenly spread over the 
two larger log size classes. This was based on Pöyry's observations and 
measurements of an area of forest where stocking was low, although the size of 
some trees was quite large. 

In 2009, this species group increased to 106 000 ha, which constitutes a 70% 
increase. As at 31 December 2009, the 'other species' group makes up 22% of the 
total Sino-Forest area. Because of the increase in area of this crop type, Pöyry 
chose to spend some time assessing this species group during the 2009 field 
assessment. Specifically, in order to obtain indicative yield estimates, Pöyry 
established nine inventory plots, in northern Guangxi province, in December 2009. 
Even with these additional inventory plots, the available inventory data is 
insufficient as a basis for the development of a statistically reliable yield table. 

Given the data limitations, Pöyry was able to apply only very basic biometric 
assumptions in estimating the recoverable volume and log product mix. The results 
are presented below, and will require revision in subsequent valuations, when more 
data becomes available.

2 BROADLEAF CROPTYPE 
As part of the 2009 valuation field assessment, 34 plots were established and 
measured in natural second-growth broadleaf forest in two counties in Yunnan 
province. Analyses of the data indicated that the estimate of mean recoverable 
volume per hectare was close to the 181 m3/ha (constant across age–assuming 
insignificant growth) of the yield table applied in the 2008 valuation.  

Pöyry has this year become aware that, under current regulations, this crop type 
cannot be clearfelled, but must be selectively logged, with only up to 50% of the 
volume allowed to be removed. Pöyry has consequently adjusted the yield table for 
the broadleaf croptype, from 181 m3/ha to 90 m3/ha to reflect this constraint. 

3 PURCHASED EUCALYPTUS CROPTYPE 
Sino-Forest owns about 75 000 ha of eucalyptus. About two-thirds of this is forest 
that Sino-Forest has planted, with the balance being purchased forest. During the 
field inspections of 2008 and 2009, Pöyry established and measured 50 inventory 
plots in eucalypts. All of these were located in forest planted by Sino-Forest. The 
plots of 2008 were used as the basis of revising the eucalypt yield table for the 
2008 valuation. In Pöyry's opinion, it is unlikely that areas of eucalypts that Sino-
Forest has purchased will have benefited from the same level of tree selection and 
genetic improvement, or as intensive establishment management as the areas that 
Sino-Forest has planted itself. Accordingly, in the 2009 valuation, Pöyry has 
chosen to apply a different yield table to the purchased eucalypt crops. For the 
purchased eucalypts, a yield of 70% of the planted eucalypts has been assumed. 
Accordingly, at age 6 years for example, while in the areas of planted eucalypts we 
are forecasting a recoverable volume of 127 m3/ha, in the purchased eucalypt crops, 
this has been reduced to 89 m3/ha. More inventory data will be required to test this 
assumption. 

3.1 Chinese Fir 
Nine plots planted with Chinese fir were established and measured in southern 
Hunan province. These were crops aged 18 and 21 years. Data analyses indicated 
that estimates of the mean recoverable volume per hectare on age was close to the 
recoverable volumes of the average generic yield table used in the valuation for 
Chinese fir. No adjustments have therefore been made to the yield table for Chinese 
fir in the 2009 valuation. 

No other adjustments have been made to yield tables applied in the 2009 valuation.

Investment Appraisal for Forest Investment in China 

A. Background and brief executive summary 
 
A.1 Introduction 
 
You have requested Auckland UniServices Limited ("Auckland UniServices" or 
"we") to prepare a report on the weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") for a 
generic forest asset in the country of China.  
 
In accordance with the terms of our engagement we use the capital asset pricing 
model ("CAPM") to determine the cost of equity capital.  
 
The cost of capital is denominated in United States dollars ("USD") from the 
perspective of an international investor. 
 
This report is subject to our declaration and restrictions on the use as set out in section 
B and Appendix 1. 
 
A.2 Results 
 
In summary we conclude under the different versions of the CAPM model that we 
apply: 

• The estimates of the real post-corporate tax WACC denominated in USD for 
a generic forest asset in China is between 5.9% and 9.7%. 

 
Table 1 
Chinese corporate tax rate "Low" estimate "High" estimate 

Corporate tax rate = 25% 5.9% 9.6% 

Corporate tax rate = 15% 6.0% 9.7% 

 
 
• The estimates of the real pre-corporate tax WACC denominated in USD for 

a generic forest asset in China is between circa 7.1% and 12.8%.1 
 

Table 2 
Chinese corporate tax rate "Low" estimate "High" estimate 
Corporate tax rate = 25% 7.9% 12.8% 
Corporate tax rate = 15% 7.1% 11.4% 

 
These cost of capital estimates apply as at 9 December 2009. 
 
 

                                                 
1 The conversion of a post-tax WACC to an "equivalent" pre-tax WACC is based on a simple 
transformation formula. In practice, however, formal modelling of the entity's cashflows is required to 
determine an "equivalent" pre-tax WACC. 



 

 4

Our "low" and "high" estimates are not absolute lower and upper bounds of the 
possible range of the WACCs but rather reflect a low and high range based on 
estimates of the parameter inputs under the different versions of the CAPM we adopt. 
The lower and upper bounds for the WACC may be wider than the range of estimates 
provided in the tables above if we undertook additional sensitivity analysis based on 
different versions of the CAPM.  
 
 
A.3 Impact of the recent credit crisis 
 
As at the date of this report, financial and capital markets are still being impacted by 
high volatility and uncertain economic prospects.  
 
In our view the ongoing consequences of the global credit crunch include, inter-alia: 
 

• Significantly higher cost of capital for those firms that have high leverage 
and/or high degrees of operating leverage. Credit or default spreads on 
investment grade (BBB) debt has widened to around 4.50% - 5.00% (or 
more). Equity risk premiums will also have increased, at least over the short-
to-medium term time horizon; 

 
• Ongoing balance sheet risk and focus by firms and investors on "de-

leveraging". Companies that have significant debt maturing in the near-term 
and have a weak credit rating may find it extremely difficult to re-finance 
their debt obligations;  

 
• Higher than normal volatility in interest rates, commodity prices, inflation 

rates and exchange rates; and 
 

• Increased regulation to address "market failure". 
 
 
A.4 Limitations of the CAPM 
 
The CAPM is a theoretical asset pricing model and we strongly recommend (to the 
extent such evidence is available) our estimates of the cost of capital for a Chinese 
forest entity be compared to implied discount rates or other evidence based on actual 
forest or forest related sales in the Chinese market.  
 
We note the Chinese legal, institutional and bankruptcy laws differ to Western capital 
markets. In addition restrictions on the level of foreign ownership of forest assets may 
apply in China and in emerging markets the level of corporate governance may vary 
significantly between companies (see Klapper and Love, 2004, Chen et al., 2003).  
 
Corporate governance is important as it provides mechanisms whereby outside 
investors can protect themselves against expropriation of assets by insiders. Corporate 
governance can impact on the risks that outside investors may face in respect of any 
expropriation of assets.  
 



 

 5

These factors together with size and other market frictions may warrant an adjustment 
to the cashflow expectations and/or an increment to the cost of capital for the forest if 
investors' property rights are not clearly defined. Where control is not obtained a 
minority discount and /or illiquidity discount may apply. 
 

 

B. Declaration, recipients of our report, use of our advice and restrictions on the 
use of this report 
This report has been prepared for Pöyry Forest Industry Limited ("Pöyry"). The report 
was written by Dr Alastair Marsden on behalf of Auckland UniServices and has been 
based primarily on information available up to 9 December 2009. The cost of capital 
estimates apply as at that date. 
 
The current volatility in the equity and debt markets and potential for irrational 
behaviour by investors makes valuation and determination of a fair cost of capital 
difficult to determine as at the date of this report. Potential market participants may 
have materially different views on value and cost of capital in the current global credit 
crisis. Our report should therefore be viewed in this context. 
 
Because of its special nature, our report may not be suited for any purpose other than 
as described in this report. We will not be liable for any loss or damage to any party 
other than Pöyry who may rely on our report. Appendix 1 sets out in more detail our 
statement of independence, qualifications, declaration, disclaimer and restrictions on 
the use of this report. 
 
 
C. Information Sources 
 
In preparing this report we have relied on information received from: 
 

• Data sourced from internet websites (as referenced); 
• Other articles and sources (where referenced); and 
• Discussions with yourself. 
 

In accordance with the terms of our engagement letter we have not audited or 
independently verified any of the information sourced or provided to us. 
  
 

D. Introduction to capital budgeting and cost of capital in developing markets: 

 An estimate of the cost of capital is critical to value any entity or investment project 
using discounted cash flow ("DCF") analysis.  

Investments in developing markets are generally perceived to have higher risk 
compared to investments in countries with a stable political and economic 
environment.  Risks of investing in developing markets include high inflation, capital 
controls, political instability, corruption, poor accounting and managerial controls, an 
uncertain legal framework and lack of protection of investor property rights.  



 

 6

The alternative conceptual approaches to recognise these "risks" using DCF analysis 
and to value an entity in a developing country are to:2 

• Discount 'promised' cash flows at a cost of capital that includes a risk 
premium for country and other idiosyncratic factors. Under this approach an 
increment is added to the cost of capital to recognise risk that is not explicitly 
modelled into the cashflow expectations; or 

• Discount 'expected' cash flows based on probability-weighted scenarios. 
Under this approach certain specific country risks will likely result in a 
downward adjustment in cash flow expectations compared to the alternative 
approach of adding an increment to the cost of capital.  

To recognise the higher perceived risk of investing in developing markets, common 
practice is to adopt the first approach and adjust the discount rate by adding a 
premium to the cost of capital that incorporates an increment for country-risk 
premium factors (see Keck at al. (1998), Lessard (1996)).  

James and Koller (2000) argue, however, that the better (alternative) approach to 
capital budgeting in markets is to recognise specific project or unique country risks in 
the expectations of cashflows.  First, with increased global integration of capital 
markets investors can diversify away from many specific country risks. Second, many 
country risks may be unique or idiosyncratic to that country and may not apply 
equally to all industries in that country. Third, use of the credit risk of the country to 
determine the cost of capital for an entity may be a poor proxy for the entity's risk.      

We are not privy to the specific risks that Pöyry proposes to model in the cashflows to 
value the Chinese forest assets. However, the range of cost of capital estimates that 
we derive in this report incorporate a country risk premium.  

 

E. Overview of the different CAPM models we apply to estimate the cost of 
equity for developing markets 

 

E.1. Use of Capital Asset Pricing Model ("CAPM") in developing markets 

The risks attributable to any investment can broadly be classified as: 

• Systematic or non-diversifiable risk, e.g., world market risk, macro-economic 
risks associated with shocks to GNP, interest rates etc; and 

• Non-systematic or unique projects risks. For developing markets these are often 
one-sided or asymmetric (and primarily of a 'downside nature').  

Under the standard CAPM, risk is measured by the beta of a project or investment. 
Beta only captures systematic or non-diversifiable risk in the firm or project.  

 
                                                 
2 See Chapter 19, Copeland, T., Koller, T. and J. Murrin, 2000.

We summarize below the global CAPM and the versions of the CAPM based on those 
proposed by Damodaran (2003) to estimate the cost of capital for an investment in 
emerging markets. We then apply Damodaran's versions of the CAPM to determine 
the cost of capital for a generic forest asset in China.3  
 
 
E.2. Global CAPM 
 

Under the global CAPM the expected return on equity, Rei, for the company is 
given by: 

 
Rei = Rf US + βi US * (RM US – Rf US) 
 
In this version of the global CAPM the US market is assumed to proxy for a 
global integrated market and investors are assumed to hold a globally diversified 
portfolio. In this case, Rf US is US risk-free rate and the term (RM US – Rf US) 
represents the expected global market risk premium.  
 
The beta of asset i (βi US) is measured against a global market portfolio. Country 
risk is not accounted for in this model since it is assumed to be diversifiable.  

 
 
E.3. Damodaran's Models 
 

Under Damodaran's (2003) model the expected return on equity, Rei, for the 
company is given by: 

 
Rei = Rf US + βi US * (RM US – Rf US) + Country risk premium 

 
Damodaran (2003) suggests a number of ways to the estimate the Country risk 
premium. These are: 
 
(i) the country risk premium is set equal to the country bond default spread;  
 
(ii) the country risk premium equals the product of the global market risk 

premium and the ratio of local equity market volatility and US (global) 
market volatility (σLocal Equity/σUS); and  

 
(iii) the country risk premium equals the product of the country bond default 

spread (RCountry Risk) and the ratio of local equity market volatility and 
country bond volatility (σLocal Equity/σCountry Bond).  

 
Intuitively we may expect a country's equity risk premium to be larger than the 
country bond default spread.  We use Damodaran's approach No. (iii) to 
determine the Country risk premium for emerging markets and the market of 
China. 
 

                                                 
3 Also see Pereiro (2001) for an overview of some of the different cost of capital models that may be 
applied to emerging markets.  



 

 8

The βi US is the equity beta for an equivalent or comparable US based project. 
  
For individual projects, Damodaran's estimate of the country risk premium can be 
incorporated into the cost of equity in three different ways. 
 
Model 1.   The same country risk premium is assumed for all projects in the 
country: 
 
Rei = Rf US + βi US * (RM US – Rf US) + Country risk premium 
 
Model 2.  The country equity risk premium is adjusted by the equity beta of the 
project: 
 
Rei = Rf US + βi US * [RM US – Rf US + Country risk premium] 
 
Model 3.  The country equity risk premium is adjusted by a 'lambda' coefficient 
that measures the individual project's exposure to country risk: 
 
Rei = Rf US + βi US * (RM US – Rf US) + λi * Country risk premium

F. Application of suggested approaches to estimate the weighted average cost of 
capital for a generic forest asset in China. 
 
Damodaran's (2003) models discussed in the prior section above are used to estimate 
the cost of capital for the forestry sector in China. 
 

F.1. Assumptions 

 
Assumptions with respect to US / global risk parameters are presented in Table 3 
below.

Expected US  inflation 2.00% 2.00% 

 
 
F.1.1. Parameter estimates in Table 3 
 
Risk free rate 
The average yield as at 9 December 2009 on long-term (10-20 yr) USD Treasury 
bonds was circa 3.9%.4 This is assumed to be a proxy for the global long-term risk 
free rate.  

Market risk premium (RM US – Rf US) 
The market risk premium ("MRP") can be estimated in a number of ways. These 
include simple historical averaging of the observed risk premium, forward-looking 
approaches, the methodology of Siegel (1992) and survey evidence. 
 
Historical estimates 
 
Studies on the historical market risk premium include Ibbotson (2008), who measured 
the historical arithmetic MRP for US stocks for the period 1926 - 2007 at between 
7.1% (referenced to the S&P and long-term bonds) and 8.50% (referenced to the S&P 
and short-term bonds).  Similarly, Damodaran (2009) provides a historical arithmetic 
estimate of the MRP for the US market over the period 1928 -2008 of 5.32% (stocks 
minus Treasury bonds) and 7.30% (stocks minus Treasury bills).

A recent study by Dimson et al. (2009) also provides estimates of the historical risk 
premium for a number of developed countries over the period 1900 to 2008. These 
historical estimates for 17 developed countries are summarised in the table below.

Forward-looking estimates and Siegel methodology 
 
Most forward-looking estimates of the MRP are lower than the historical estimates of 
the MRP. For example, Fama and French (2002) generate forward-looking estimates 
for the US standard market risk premium of 2.6%-4.3% over the period 1951-2000. 
Similarly Claus and Thomas (2001) generate estimates of the MRP for a number of 
countries with a maximum of 3.0%.  
 
Siegel (1992, 1999) argues that historical US estimates of the MRP have been biased 
upwards due to unexpectedly high inflation in the latter part of the 20th century.  
 
Similarly, Dimson et al. (2009) consider a downward adjustment to the measured 
historical MRP is justified if there has been a long-term change in capital market 
conditions and investors' required rates of return in the future are expected to be 
lower than in the past. Dimson et al. (2009, p37)  estimate an arithmetic mean of the 
world market risk premium of between 4.5% and 5.0% relative to bills (short term 
bonds) based on a decomposition of historical returns into a long term dividend yield, 
real dividend growth, changes in price to dividend ratios and real exchange rate 
changes.  
 
Ibbotson and Chen (2003) argue, however, based on their decomposition of historical 
equity returns into supply factors of inflation, earnings, dividends, the price to 
earnings ratio, dividend payout ratio, book value, return on equity and GDP, that the 
forecast arithmetic MRP (relative to long-term bonds) is around 6.0% for the United 
States. Similarly Mehra (2003) on the equity risk premium puzzle concludes that the 
MRP is likely to be similar to what it has been in the past. 5 
 
Survey evidence 
 

                                                 
5 The equity risk premium puzzle refers to the inability of standard economic models to explain why 
the MRP has been so high in many developed countries such as the United States.

Impact of the recent global credit crisis 
 
The global credit crisis began with the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market in 
the US, starting August 2007. This led to significant write-downs in the value of 
securitised mortgages and collateralised debt obligations held by major US and 
international financial institutions. 
 
During 2008 the crisis deepened in the US with the demise of household names such 
as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and American Insurance 
Group. Led by a rapid slowing in the US economy, many economies moved into a 
steep recession in 2008 and recorded large output losses during late 2008 and early 
2009. The turmoil in financial and real markets sparked a strong response from 
governments across the globe to allay concerns over systemic financial collapse and 
to support demand to ease serious fears of a global depression. 
 
The systemic nature of the economic shock has led to a collapse in investor 
confidence which is only tentatively recovering. The recent announcement of the 
inability of the Dubai development company to meet its short term financing 
commitments is a clear illustration of the fragility of any current perceived recovery. 
Because the shock has been systemic in nature and risks are positively correlated with 
market returns, investors have been unable to diversify away from these risks. 
 

Consequences of the Global Credit Crisis 
 
The consequences of the global financial crisis have included: 
 

• A significant disruption to economic growth. The latest World Economic 
Outlook (International Monetary Fund, 2009) reports that world output growth 
slowed sharply from 5.2% in 2007 to 3.0% in 2008 before declining further to 
-1.1% in 2009. Although world output growth is expected to recover in 2010 
the losses in output that have been experienced are expected to be permanent. 
 

• A worldwide collapse in equity prices which has been followed by a partial 
rebound.  



 

 12

 
This fall in equity prices may be attributable to a variety of factors. These 
include: 

- Investors' expectation of a long-run decline in corporate profitability or 
cash flow as a result of the decline in private sector demand; 

- An increase in the market risk premium or the long-term cost of equity 
capital;6 or 

- Irrational pricing behaviour and over-reaction (on the downside) by 
investors in response to the negative economic shock of the global credit 
crisis. 

 
• A significant increase in the cost of debt particularly for firms that are a weak 

credit risk, have high gearing and/or have high operating leverage. 
 
On a forward looking basis, an estimate of the ex-ante MRP will be higher if 
investors' risk aversion has increased and the fall in equity prices outweighs the 
impact of lower forecast cashflows and profitability for firms. 
 
The increase in market volatility can, however, be viewed in two ways.7 High 
volatility may simply reflect that investors continue to require long-run observed 
historical risk premiums. When the credit crisis eventually passes, markets will return 
to normal levels of volatility and there will be no change to the long-term MRP.  
 
On the other hand the impact of the credit crisis and higher current volatility may 
reflect a structural increase in the MRP, at least over the short to medium term time 
horizon. 
 
 
Conclusion on MRP 
In conclusion we assume the ex-ante global MRP to be 5.50% to 6.50%. While this is 
lower than historical estimates of the market risk premium for many developed 
countries, the assumption of full market integration under a global CAPM should lead 
to greater diversification of risk and hence lower the forward-looking market risk 
premium.  

 
Global Beta 
 
As already noted beta is a measure of the systematic risk of a firm (i.e., non-
diversifiable risk or that part of the risk of an asset that cannot be diversified away).  
 
Estimation of beta almost invariably involves an element of judgement.

Fundamental factors that impact on beta  
 
Beta is a relative risk measure and measures the sensitivity of returns on a stock 
relative to market returns (e.g., in response to macroeconomic shocks to GDP, interest 
rates, taxes etc.). The beta of the market is one.   
 
Factors that impact on the sensitivity of returns to real economic / GNP shocks and 
hence the estimate of an entity's or company's beta include:11 
 

• Nature of the industry. Companies that produce products that are essential 
commodities or supply essential services should have less sensitivity to real 
Gross Domestic Product shocks compared to companies that produce 
discretionary commodities or services.  

• Duration of contracts. Companies with fixed price contracts will have lower 
risk and beta as returns will be less sensitive to economic shocks or broad 
market movements. 

                                                 
10 Ibid. 
11 See Lally, M., 2000, The cost of equity capital and its estimation, McGraw-Hill series in Advanced 
Finance. 



 

 15

• The type of customer. Companies producing products or providing services to 
the private sector should be more sensitive to economic shocks than 
companies producing products or services for the public sector.  

• Degree and type of regulation. As a general rule companies that supply 
monopoly services subject to regulation will have lower sensitivity to real 
GDP shocks. Regulation, however, that prevents companies responding to 
economic shocks may increase risk and beta.  

• Presence of real options. The presence of expansion options (exercised in an 
economic upturn) should increase the company's sensitivity to economic 
shocks. By contrast options that permit the company to contract its operations 
should reduce the company's sensitivity to economic shocks.   

• Operating leverage. Companies with high operating leverage (high fixed costs 
to operating costs) will be more sensitive to real GDP shocks, as returns will 
be more sensitive to changes in demand for the company's goods or services.  

• Market weight. An increase in an industry weight in the market proxy will 
tend to draw the company's beta towards one. 

• Shocks to the discount rate. 
 
 
Summary on beta 
 
Overall the empirical evidence suggests an appropriate asset beta for a generic forest 
asset of between circa 0.40 and 0.75. Based on fundamental factors, however, we 
consider a lower bound asset beta for a timber resource would be higher than 0.45.  
 
We conclude that the asset beta of a pure-play forestry owner of timber resources is 
likely to be in the range 0.50 to 0.75. 
 
 
US inflation rate 
 
As at 9 December 2009 the ten-year inflation-indexed Treasury yield spread or the 
difference between nominal and inflation-indexed bonds yields was circa 2.30%.12  
 
The yield spread on 20-year US Treasury bonds compared to US Treasury real long 
term interest rates was also circa 2.3%. 13 
 
At present there is a high degree of uncertainty and a wide difference in consensus 
estimates of inflation given the impact of the recent credit crisis, with estimates for 
US inflation between circa 1.5% p.a. (least optimistic forecasters) and 3.0% p.a. (most 
optimistic forecasters). 14

For China we assume a country bond default spread of between 1.00 and 2.00%.  
This reflects increased investor risk aversion in the context of the current global credit 
crisis. Damodaran (2009) also determines a default spread of 1.4% for China which 
falls in the range of our estimate. 
 
Ratio of local equity market volatility and country bond volatility (σLocal 
Equity/σCountry Bond) 
 
We do not have data to empirically measure this estimate. In the absence of any 
empirical evidence we assume the ratio of (σLocal Equity/σCountry Bond) is 1.5.18  
 
Sensitivity to country risk premium (λi) 
 
The term λi is the sensitivity of each project / company to country risk (Damodaran, 
2003). The average value of λi is one.  
 
We understand the timber in the Chinese forest will be sold almost entirely into the 
domestic market (i.e., no exports) and with prices set domestically. Similarly costs to 
harvest and produce the timber are exposed to Chinese country risk.  
 
Recent evidence by Cavaglia, Brightman and Aked (2000) suggests that with 
increased worldwide market integration, industry risk factors are growing in relative 
importance to country risk factors. The study by Cavaglia, Brightman and Aked is, 
nevertheless, confined to developed markets. Evidence by Harvey (1995) finds returns 
in developing markets are still likely to be influenced by local (domestic) factors 
compared to market returns in more developed countries.  
 
In summary we assume the value of λi for a forest company in a developing market of 
China is between 0.8 and 1.2 (i.e., average exposure to Chinese country risk).   
 
Corporate tax rate 
 
Based on information provided by Pöyry and discussions with you we assume the 
corporate tax rate is 25% in China. However, we also provide our estimate of the real 
post-corporate and real post-corporate tax WACC assuming a corporate tax rate of 
15%.19 
 
We understand the corporate tax rate applies to the marginal cost of one dollar of 
additional interest expense on debt and hence is appropriate for use in the 
determination of the weighted average cost of capital. Other non-deductible taxes, 

                                                 
18 See Damodaran (2009). 
19 See http://www.worldwide-tax.com/china/chi_econonews.asp. From Jan 2008 China's new corporate 
tax rate is 25%. The new corporate tax rate applies to both domestic and foreign companies. The new 
tax rate replaces the previous tax rate of 33%. Foreign companies which set up activities before 2008 
can enjoy, for a limited period, the previous 15% tax rate or tax holiday.

certain payroll taxes and withholding payments may need to be modelled in the 
cashflows and are not accounted for in our estimate of the WACC.  
 
In this respect we are not taxation experts and do not have a detailed knowledge of 
China's tax system. 
 
We note the presence of any tax concessions in the Chinese market may lower the 
effective corporate tax rate. A lower effective corporate tax rate would raise our post-
tax WACC estimate. The forest value may still, however, be greater due to higher 
expected after-corporate tax cashflows. In addition we note the presence of "tax 
holidays" (if any) and tax losses that can be carried forward potentially introduce 
considerable complexity into capital budgeting. A discussion of capital budgeting 
(and cost of capital) under time varying tax rates is outside the scope of this report.20   
 
Debt margin and debt ratio 
 
The impact of the global credit crisis has resulted in significantly higher cost of 
capital for those firms that have high leverage and/or high degrees of operating 
leverage.  
 
In addition credit or default spreads on investment grade (BBB or Baa) debt has 
widened to around 4.50% - 5.00% (or more). 
 
We do not have sufficient detailed information to accurately determine a debt margin 
for a forest project in the developing market of China. However, for the WACC 
calculated using the CAPM we assume a debt margin of 4.5% over the US 
Government bond rate (Rf US). This is higher than historical debt margins but reflects 
much wider spreads in the current economic environment.  
 
To calculate the WACC we assume a debt to equity ratio of 0.15:0.85 for a long term 
investment in a forest asset.  
 
F.2. Economic data 
 
You have requested us not to provide any commentary on the economic outlook or 
political developments in China. We understand this may be covered in a separate 
report prepared for Pöyry.

G.1 Results for range of assumptions  
 
We summarise in Table 12 the estimated WACC denominated in USD (both nominal 
and real) under Damodaran's (2003) Models 1, 2 and 3 assuming: 
 
• Asset beta = 0.50 to 0.75; 
• Market risk premium = 5.50% to 6.50%;  
• Country bond default spread =  1.0% to 2.0%;  
• Sensitivity to country risk premium (λi) = 0.8 to 1.2; and 
• Corporate tax rate = 25%

The average real post-corporate tax WACC under the three alternative models is 
circa 5.9% and 9.7% as follows:

Corporate tax rate Low estimate High estimate 
Corporate tax rate = 25% 5.9% 9.6% 
Corporate tax rate = 15% 6.0% 9.7% 

 
Our "low" and "high" estimates are not lower and upper bounds of the possible range 
of the WACCs but rather reflect a low and high range based on estimates of the 
parameter inputs under the different versions of the CAPM we adopt. The lower and 
upper bounds for the WACC may be wider than the range of estimates provided in the 
tables above if we undertook additional sensitivity analysis based on different 
versions of the CAPM.

H. Comparison to our prior cost of capital estimates for a forest entity in China 
 
We provide below a summary of our current estimates for the real post-corporate tax 
WACC for a generic forest asset in China compared to the estimates in our prior 
reports as at November 2008. 
 
Table 15: Real after corporate tax WACC 

  
Estimated range 
November 2008 

Estimated range 
December 2009 

Real after corporate tax WACC 7.3% - 10.8% 5.9% - 9.7% 
Real pre-corporate tax WACC 9.8% - 15.9% 7.1% - 12.8% 

 
Both our after-corporate tax and pre-corporate tax cost of capital estimates have 
decreased over the period between November 2008 and December 2009. This 
predominantly reflects a decrease in the asset beta for a pure play forest entity and an 
increase in the expected rate of inflation from 1.0% p.a. to 2.0% p.a.. Table 16 
summarises the factors that are responsible for the increase in our cost of capital 
estimate over this period.

I. Summary and determination of a pre-corporate tax real WACC 
 
Conversion to a real pre-tax WACC 
 
There is no easy or simple method to transform a nominal post-corporate tax WACC 
to a real pre-corporate tax WACC. In this respect formal modelling of the entity's 
cashflows is required to determine an "equivalent" pre-tax WACC. 
 
However, to an approximation we assume:21 
 
Pre-tax real WACC = (Post-corporate real tax WACC ) / (1- tc) 
 
Where tc = corporate tax rate. 
 
Based on this transformation our indicative estimate of the real pre-tax WACC 
(denominated in USD) is between circa 7.1% and 12.8%22 as follows: 
 
Table 17: Weighted Pre-corporate Tax Average WACC Estimates from 3 Different Models 
for a generic forestry firm in China 

Corporate tax rate Low estimate High estimate 
Corporate tax rate = 25% 7.9% 12.8% 

Corporate tax rate = 15% 7.1% 11.4% 

 
 
J. Size, liquidity and other premiums 
 
Our cost of capital estimates are derived using different versions of the CAPM only.23 
In our determination of the cost of capital and WACC we have made no adjustment 
for factors such as size, control premiums, illiquidity premiums and other market 
frictions.  
  
Making an ad-hoc adjustment to the "standard" CAPM model rate of return for size 
and liquidity measures may be somewhat arbitrary. However, we understand from 
anecdotal evidence that many practitioners and forest valuers add an increment to the 
cost of capital to value small illiquid forests and/or where other significant market 
frictions may exist.  
 

                                                 
21 In the case of forests where the timber is not expected to be harvested until some relatively long-time 
in the future, this transformation may overstate the "equivalent" pre-corporate tax WACC. 
22 As already noted, in view of the uncertainty of the parameter input estimates these low and high 
values should not be taken as absolute lower or upper bounds of the possible distribution of the 
WACC. 
23 There are a number of shortcomings of the CAPM (e.g., see Fama and French, 1993, 1996). We 
would be happy to discuss some of the possible shortcomings of the CAPM in more detail if requested.

K. Conclusion on USD Cost of Capital 
 
In conclusion under the different versions of Damodaran's (2003) CAPM we consider 
a real post-corporate tax WACC (denominated in USD) for a China forest entity 
will likely be in the range of between 5.9% and 9.7%. The corresponding real pre-
corporate tax WACC (denominated in USD) is in the range between circa 7.1% and 
12.8% (based on our simple transformation formula). The range of estimates assumes 
a corporate tax rate of between 15% and 25%. 
 
Our cost of capital estimates are as at 9 December 2009 and all denominated in USD. 
 
L. Other Factors Relevant to the estimation of the Cost of Capital 
 
If significant corporate governance and agency cost issues between insiders and 
outside investors arise (e.g., from lack of transparency, possible risk of expropriation 
of assets, restrictions on offshore remittance of profits or the likelihood of exchange 
rate controls), the use of a cost of capital at the upper end (or higher) of our range may 
be warranted.24 
 
We also strongly recommend (to the extent such evidence is available) our estimates 
of the cost of capital for a Chinese forest entity be compared to implied discount rates 
based on transactional evidence for actual forest sales in the Chinese market.  
 
In addition we note that China's legal, institutional and bankruptcy laws likely differ 
to Western capital markets. Restrictions on the level of foreign ownership of forest 
assets may apply in China and the level of corporate governance may vary 
significantly between companies in emerging markets (see Klapper and Love, 2004, 
Chen et al., 2003).  
 
Corporate governance is important as it provides mechanisms whereby outside 
investors can protect themselves against expropriation of assets by insiders.  
 
These factors together with any size and liquidity premium may warrant an 
adjustment to the cashflow expectations or an increment to the cost of capital for a 
forest investment if investors' property rights are not clearly defined.
