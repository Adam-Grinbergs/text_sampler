Executive Summary (Item 3) 
Property Description and Accessibility 
The Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project is located in Crook County, northeastern Wyoming. 
The property is an advanced stage exploration property that had limited open-pit uranium 
production in the 1950s, a reported historical in-situ resource defined in the early 1970s, several 
other occurrences and historical uranium mines, and was drilled by NCA Nuclear Inc. (NCA 
Nuclear) in November and December 2006. SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc [SRK] has utilized NCA 
Nuclear drilling data to prepare a current and compliant resource estimate as stated in this report 
for the Busfield deposit of 250,000 tons of indicated resource grading 0.08% eU3O8 for 397,000 
contained pounds eU3O8, and an additional 3,000 tons of inferred resource grading 0.08% eU3O8 
for 5,000 contained pounds (see Table 1). Uranium mineralization is sandstone-hosted typical of 
uranium deposits in Wyoming. The Elkhorn project consists of over 7,000 acres of mineral rights 
under NCA Nuclear's control, and is one of 4 uranium properties the company holds in the Black 
Hills region of northeastern Wyoming. 

 

The Elkhorn Property has been inactive as a small scale mining operation since 1957, and was 
last active for uranium exploration in the early 1970s. NCA Nuclear drilling on the property in 
2006 is the first activity since 1974, due to depressed uranium commodity prices until the past 18 
months. Northern Canadian Minerals' wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, NCA Nuclear, has secured 
an exploration agreement on the property (along with other exploration parcels in the region) 
with option to purchase. NCA Nuclear has conducted an initial exploration drilling program to 
confirm mineralization and the geologic parameters (mineralization boundaries) and has 
established a current resource estimate of the Busfield deposit, which was previously defined by 
historical drilling. This NI 43-101 Technical Report presents NCA Nuclear's initial resource 
estimate for the Busfield deposit, Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project, and a description of the 
property exploration potential. 

History 
The Hulett area was prospected for uranium during the initial uranium boom in the 1950s, in the 
mid-1970s, and again in  2006. Two mines, the Busfield Mine and Vickers Mine, were important 
uranium producers in 1956-1957. Up to October 1957, each of these mines had produced 9,000 
tons or more of uranium ore. According to the records of the Atomic Energy Commission 
through 1957 (Davis and Izett, 1962), the Busfield mine had produced approximately 9,000 tons 
of ore containing 0.17 percent U3O8, and the Vickers mine had produced between 9,000 and 
10,000 tons of ore containing 0.18 percent U308. In 1962, these mines were thought to be mined 
out. Exploration in the region continued until the mid-1970s, with the definition of historical

resources at the Busfield Extension deposit of 158,000 tons grading 0.11% U3O8 for 341,000 
pounds U3O8 in situ resource/reserve. The historical data that supports the above stated 
resource/reserves is incomplete and is insufficiently described to reconcile with current 
resource/reserve classification. The data supporting those resource/reserve numbers was not 
reviewed by a qualified person; therefore, it should not be relied upon. NCA Nuclear is not 
reporting these numbers as reserves or resources. NCA Nuclear is reporting current and NI 43-
101 compliant resources as stated in Section 15 of this report, based entirely on NCA drilling 
data. 

Geology 
Uranium mineralization in Wyoming typically occurs in sandstone-hosted environments in 
intermontane basins. The uranium deposits in the Elkhorn regions are characteristic of this style 
of uranium occurrence, which are typically called sandstone-hosted "roll-front" uranium 
deposits.  

Roll-front sandstone uranium deposits formed in Tertiary continental fluvial basins developed 
between uplifts. These uranium deposits were formed by oxidizing uranium-bearing 
groundwaters that entered the host sandstone from the edges of the basins. Two possible sources 
of the uranium were (1) uraniferous Precambrian granite that provided sediment for the host 
sandstone and (2) overlying Tertiary age (Oligocene) volcanic ash sediments. 

Uranium mineralization in the Elkhorn Project area is hosted in lower Cretaceous age Fall River 
Formation sandstone that is gently dipping northwest off the Black Hills uplift. As uranium 
moved in groundwater through the sandstones, it was channeled by the impermeable shales 
above and below the sandstones. Uranium minerals were precipitated in the reducing 
environments influenced by the carbonaceous material present in the sandstones as former plant 
material. The Black Hills uplift exhibits gently dipping sandstone along the north and northwest 
flank and along the south and southwest flank. The entire region had been the focus of uranium 
exploration during the 1960s an 1970s, with renewed interest in the last year. 

Resources 
The area of the Busfield Extension historical deposit adjacent to the Busfield historical mine was 
re-drilled by NCA Nuclear in the fall of 2006. That drilling is the basis for a current and NI 43-
101-compliant resource estimate completed by SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. as indicated in Table 
1.

The current resource estimate uses only new data generated by NCA Nuclear, using geo-
statistical methods including variography to determine search parameters for grade interpolation, 
block modeling, and classification by CIM categories. Details of the resource estimation are 
presented in Section 15 of this report.  

Conclusions and Recommendations 
Work by NCA Nuclear has allowed for current resource estimation that confirms a historical 
uranium resource on a small portion of the current property holdings. Exploration potential exists 
to define other resources on the property. Further drilling at the Busfield Extension deposit will 
provide more information to allow better quantification of the in situ uranium resource and 
improve the confidence in the resource estimate. A program of additional reverse circulation 
(RC) and core drilling to provide samples for chemical uranium assays is recommended to 
confirm uranium chemical equilibrium/disequilibrium with radiometric grade determinations, 
and to provide samples for mineralogical and metallurgical testing. Property-wide exploration 
drilling, as well as exploration in the vicinity of the Busfield resource, has the potential to add in 
situ resource pounds and perhaps identify other areas with equal or greater resource potential, 
from an exploration perspective. A minimum program of $417,000 is recommended as a Phase I 
exploration program, with a potential for advancing the project to the Scoping Study stage in a 
Phase II program estimated at $1,000,000; Phase I and Phase II will take approximately 9 
months and 12 months respectively to complete, as defined in Section 18 of this report.

1 Introduction & Terms of Reference (Item 4) 
The Elkhorn Wyoming Uranium project, located in northeastern Wyoming in the northwestern 
part of the Black Hills uplift (Figure 2-1), is an exploration-stage, uranium exploration prospect 
that is owned by NCA Nuclear, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Northern Canadian Minerals, Inc. 
Initial NI 43-101 compliant resource estimates for the Elkhorn Project are presented in this 
report.  

 

1.1 Terms of Reference & Purpose of the Report 
SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. [SRK] was commissioned by NCA Nuclear Inc. (NCA Nuclear) in 
November 2006 to prepare a Canadian National Instrument 43-101-compliant Technical Report 
(NI 43-101) for the Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project in northeastern Wyoming. This report 
is a technical document based on SRK's recent inspection on behalf of NCA Nuclear of 
historical project data files and of the property held by NCA Nuclear, a review of NCA 
Nuclear's confirmation drilling program, and a resource estimate for the Busfield deposit based 
solely on NCA Nuclear's drilling. 

This Technical Report on the Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project is prepared according to 
Canadian National Instrument NI 43-101 guidelines. Form NI 43-101F1 was used as the format 
for this report. This report is prepared using the industry accepted CIM "Best Practices and 
Reporting Guidelines" for disclosing mineral exploration information, and the Canadian 
Securities Administrators revised regulations in NI 43-101 (Standards of Disclosure For Mineral 
Projects), and Companion Policy 43-101CP. 

This report is a technical document based on the information available for Elkhorn Uranium 
Project. This report has been prepared at the request of Keith Laskowski, Vice President, 
Exploration of Northern Canadian Minerals, Inc., which is a Junior Exploration Company with 
offices at Cathedral Place, Suite 1304, 925 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, B.C., Canada, V6C 
3L2. The U.S. subsidiary of Northern Canadian Minerals, Inc., is NCA Nuclear, Inc., with 
offices at 15,710 West Colfax Ave., Suite 201, Golden, Colorado 80401. Mr. Laskowski is 
President of NCA Nuclear Inc. 

The intent of this Technical Report is to provide the reader with a review of the historical 
exploration activities conducted at Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project, a discussion of the 
geology, and an explanation of procedures SRK used for resource estimation in achieving a 
current NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for the Busfield deposit on the Elkhorn property. 
The properties in the project area include several historical mines with production dating to the 
late 1950s, additional uranium occurrences, and exploration dating from the early 1970s. The 
primary focus of this report is current uranium resource estimate at the Busfield historical mine

site, and secondarily, a general discussion of the exploration potential. The properties are of 
interest today as a result of dramatic increase to the  uranium prices in the last two years. Current 
resources are stated in Section 15 of this report.  

 

1.2 Sources of Information  
The authors reviewed historical data provided by NCA Nuclear and obtained from published 
sources, conducted field investigations to confirm the data, and reviewed the project site. NCA 
Nuclear's drilling activities were examined on-site during early November 2006 during the initial 
phase of confirmation drilling. Much of exploration data for the Elkhorn Uranium Exploration 
Project are historical data dating from 1956 to 1974. NCA Nuclear has initiated exploration work 
on the property, with confirmation/resource definition drilling in November and December 2006 
for the Busfield deposit. The NCA Nuclear drilling alone constitutes the data used for current 
resources. Historical data include hard copy reports, copies of some assay certificates, company 
memos and correspondence. Most data was generated by the Atomic Energy Commission, U. S. 
Geological Survey, and exploration activities of various historical mine operators on the 
properties. Peripheral outcrops, old mine dumps, and open-pit exposures of mineralized rock are 
accessible in the Elkhorn project area.  

 

1.3 Effective Date (Item 24) 
The effective data of this report is April 18, 2007. 

 

1.4 Limitations & Reliance on Information ( Item 5) 
The author, as a Qualified Person, has relied upon data provided by NCA Nuclear for the basic 
data that supports the Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project exploration results. In the opinion of 
the author, that information is both credible and verifiable in the field. It is also the opinion of the 
author that no material information relative to the Elkhorn Project has been neglected or omitted 
from the database. Sufficient information is available to prepare this report and the current 
resource estimate, and any statements in this report related to deficiency of information are 
directed at historical information that is missing or information which, in the opinion of the 
author, has not yet been gathered, is intended to be gathered, or is recommended information to 
be collected as the project moves forward.  

The Author has relied on the work of others to describe the land tenure and land title in 
Wyoming (Section 2.2 – Mineral Titles). The author is not qualified with respect to 
environmental laws in Wyoming, as regarding issues addressed in Section 2.5 of this report – 
Environmental Liabilities.

The mineral resources stated Section 15 of this report are classified according to CIM guidelines 
and are NI 43-101 compliant and current resources. The process of resource estimation involves 
the use of technical numerical information, which requires subsequent calculations to derive sub-
totals, totals, and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding 
and consequently can introduce a margin of error. Where these rounding errors occur, SRK does 
not consider them to be material. Mineral Reserves are not yet established for the Elkhorn 
Project.

2 Property Description & Location (Item 6) 
2.1 Property Location 
The Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project is located in northeastern Wyoming in the 
northwestern foothills of the Black Hills (Figure 2-1). The Elkhorn Property is one of several 
exploration property positions held by NCA in the Black Hills region of northeastern Wyoming, 
held through an "exploration with option to purchase" agreement. The other property positions 
held in the region by NCA Nuclear are not discussed in this report as they are less well know and 
documented, and are not contiguous to the Elkhorn project.  

The Elkhorn Project area is located in northeastern Wyoming in Crook County, about 12 miles 
northwest of the town of Hulett, which is approximately 8 miles north of Devils Tower National 
Monument. The Elkhorn area is on the northwestern flanks of the Black Hills uplift of South 
Dakota and Wyoming. The Public Land Survey System coordinates of the general Elkhorn area 
include portions of Township 55, 56, and 57 North and Range 65, 66, and 67 West, 10th Guide 
Meridian and 3rd Standard Parallel North. The approximate center of the Elkhorn area of interest 
is at 104.75°W longitude (104° 45'W) and 44.81°N latitude (44° 48.6'N). The area of interest 
covers about 55 square miles and includes three mining leases on state land and three primary 
areas of unpatented mining claims.  

Much of the regional and property specific geologic, stratigraphic, and mineralization 
information for the Elkhorn Property was obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey report on 
the Strawberry Hill 7 ½ minute quadrangle in northwestern Crook County, Wyoming, which is 
bounded by latitudes 44°45' N and 44°52'30" N and by longitudes 104°37'30" W. and 104°45' 
W.  

The Busfield historical mine is located at 44° 48.4'N and 104° 44.5'W and 3,940 feet above 
mean sea level (ft amsl). The Vickers historical mine is located at 44°48.7'N and 104°45'W and 
3,940 ft amsl and is approximately 0.5 miles north-northwest of the Busfield mine (Figure 2-2). 
Both the Vickers and Busfield historical mines are part of the Elkhorn Property, and the current 
exploration activities are focused on the southeast extension of mineralization from the historical 
Busfield open pit.

2.2 Mineral Titles 
The Elkhorn Uranium exploration property consists of 3 Wyoming state land leases (Table 2-2), 
88 unpatented mining claims (Table 2-2), 1 "notice of intent to locate" (NOITL) uranium claims 
on 1,074 acres, and 8 areas of interest in the Elkhorn area (Table 2-3), as of November 5, 2006. 
Additionally, there are 2 Surface use agreements with private surface land owners in the area of 
the unpatented mining claims (Table 2-1 and Figure 2-3).  

Additional land within the area of interest (AOI) is being pursued in the following three areas: 

1. Greenwood fee land in the Quad mine area to the southwest of Busfield; 
2. Greenwood fee land to the north-northeast of the Busfield-Vickers area Federal lode 

claims; and  

3. Huton Land and Livestock fee and surface land (NOITL) in the area surrounding and to 
the north of the Storm uranium deposit in the western portion of the AOI.

Elkhorn NI 43-101_Final_18Apr07.doc   

The names and locations of the mining claims located by NCA in October of 2006 on the 
Elkhorn Property are listed in Table 2-8, along with information about the location of 
information in the Crook County recorders office; the locations are shown on Figure 2-3. The 
names and locations of mining claims located by P.A. Miller in September of 2005 and covered 
under the exploration agreement and option to purchase are listed in Table 2-9.  

Unpatented claims are located by the Mining Law of 1872 on Federal lands administered by the 
U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). To maintain mining claims in good standing, a claim 
holder must make annual maintenance fee payments to the BLM, in lieu of annual assessment 
work. Those claim fees include $125.00 per claim, plus the $10.00 per claim process fee of the 
annual filings, which currently total to approximately $135.00, plus minimal per claims costs of 
approximately $10.00 to 15.00 for claim recording fees in the County Courthouse in which the 
claims are located [Note: Initial BLM claim fees and filing costs for new claims total $165 per 
claim, including an initial $30.00 claim location fee, plus the annual maintenance fee and process 
fee]. NCA Nuclear represents that all claim filings are current and that the claims are valid until 
August 31, 2007, when the next annual maintenance fee payments and filings are due. 

A Notice of Intent to Locate (NOITL) Mining Claims must be filed with the BLM State Office 
before entering split estate lands, in which the surface is patented and mineral rights are reserved 
to the United States under the Stock Raising Homestead Act of 1916. On April 16, 1993, 
Congress amended the Stock Raising Homestead Act to establish new requirements that must be 
met before mining claims can be located on split estate lands. Claimants must record a NOITL 
with the BLM State Office (5353 Yellowstone Road, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82009 [P.O. Box 
1828, Cheyenne, WY 82003-1828], 307-775-6143) and with the surface owner before entering 
the land, exploring for minerals, or locating mining claims. Once all the NOITL requirements are 
met, the land is segregated for 90 days to allow location of mining claims. There is a $25.00 
nonrefundable service charge for recording a NOITL with the BLM State Office. NCA Nuclear 
has filed NOITLs which are subsequently followed by the staking (location) of mining claims 
within the 90 day time frame; hence, as of the date of this report, some or all of the NOITL's 
listed here may be lands held by NCA Nuclear as unpatented mining claims. 

Under an Exploration Agreement With Option to Purchase, NCA Nuclear controls land positions 
in five additional exploration areas in northeastern Wyoming and western South Dakota. These 
areas include the Aladdin area approximately 28 miles east of the Elkhorn area, the Oshoto area 
approximately 20 miles south-southeast of the Elkhorn area, the Mule Creek and Dewey 
Edgemont areas on the southwest flank of the Black Hills area in Weston and Niobrara Counties, 
Wyoming and adjacent counties of South Dakota, and the Pumpkin Buttes area of Campbell 
County Wyoming, approximately 42 miles south of Gillette, Wyoming. These exploration 
project areas are covered by state mining leases (Table 2-4), located unpatented mining claims

(Table 2-5), notices of intent to locate mining claims (Table 2-6), and areas of interest (Table 
2-7) specified in the agreement between NCA Nuclear and the Berdahl-Miller partnership. All 
the areas listed in this paragraph are property positions in Wyoming and South Dakota that are 
non-contiguous with the Elkhorn Property, and are thus not discussed further in this report. The 
lands are listed as they are part of the same property agreement by which NCA Nuclear controls 
the Elkhorn Property. 

Ownership of unpatented mining claims on BLM-administered mineral lands are in the name of 
the holder (locator), with ownership of the minerals belonging to the United States of America, 
under the administration of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Under the Mining 
Law of 1872, which governs the location of unpatented mining claims on Federal lands, the 
locator has the right to explore, develop, and mine minerals on unpatented mining claims without 
payments of production royalties to the Federal government. It should also be noted that in recent 
years there has been U.S. Congressional efforts to change the 1872 mining law, to include the 
provision of federal production royalties; however, currently annual claim maintenance fees are 
the only federal encumbrance to unpatented mining claims. Information regarding recorded 
unpatented mining claims on file with the BLM can be searched on-line at 
http://www.blm.gov/lr2000/.  

Unpatented federal lode mining claims in Wyoming and South Dakota are located in the field 
with four corner posts and a location monument. The author did not seek to verify all claim posts 
in the field, which are typically 2 x 2 inch by 4 foot (substantial) wooden posts; however, several 
claim posts and claim location notices were observed in the field. Lists of the current claims that 
comprise the Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project are shown in Table 2-8 

Claim location notices for each unpatented claim are filed with the BLM (5353 Yellowstone Rd., 
P.O. Box 1828, Cheyenne, WY 82003-1828) and at the Crook County Recorder's Office in 
Sundance, Wyoming. Copies of the individual claim notices and the detailed map showing their 
locations are on file with the BLM State Office in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and with the Crook 
County Recorder's office at the Crook County Clerk, P.O. Box 37, Sundance, WY, 82729-0037, 
(307) 283-1323, Fax (307) 283-3038.  

State mineral leases are issued by the Office of State Lands & Investments, 122 W. 25th St, 
Herschler Bldg 3W, Cheyenne, Wyoming (http://slf-web.state.wy.us/), and use the specified "¼ 
¼ ¼ Section" designator for township/range/section system that conforms to the original General 
Land Office cadastral survey in use in the western states since the late 1800s.

2.2.1 Titles and Obligations / Agreements 
The Exploration Agreement With Option to Purchase was executed with an effective data of 
March 14, 2006, between Northern Canadian Minerals, Inc. (NCA Nuclear) and Miller-Berdahl 
Partnership (MB). MB is a Wyoming general partnership which consists of Paul A. Miller and 
Ron Berdahl, partners, with an office at 330 South Summit, Newcastle, Wyoming 82701. In the 
Exploration Agreement with Option to Purchase, MB and each of the partners of MB represent 
and warrant that MB is in possession of, occupies, and owns the premises and know of no other 
person claiming any interest in the premises, and the premises are free from all liens and 
encumbrances. 

An "area of interest" (AOI) with respect to the Exploration Agreement with Option to Purchase 
is defined in Table 2-3, and shown on Figure 2-3. Additional lands acquired by NCA Nuclear in 
the AOI are subject to the terms of the Exploration Agreement with Option to Purchase.  

The authors has not verified the validity of the mining claims, their ownership, or the history of 
the land tenure in years past. The authors have received from NCA, a summary listing and title 
search for the area. A simplified version of the claim map is shown in Figure 2-3. 

A surface land agreement with fee owners consists of the Exploration Agreement with Option to 
Lease, executed between the surface owners (Judy M. Greenwood and David H. Greenwood of 
1032 18th Street, Havre, Montana 59501) and NCA Nuclear, Inc. The effective date of this 
agreement is September 1, 2006, and the term is for one year, with the option to extend the term 
for up to four additional years in yearly extensions. This agreement covers the subject properties 
listed in Table 2-1. 

 

2.2.2 Exceptions to Title Opinion 
There are no known exceptions to title known to the authors, or identified by NCA Nuclear. 

 

2.3 Royalty Agreements & Encumbrances 
Upon exercise of the Option to Purchase the Premises, NCA shall grant a Net Smelter Return 
Production Royalty ("NSR") to MB on all Minerals mined from the Property. For the Property or 
new properties staked or acquired within the areas of interest, MB will receive a 2.5% NSR. For 
new properties held by third parties within the areas of interest, MB will receive an NSR royalty 
interest of between 1% and 2.5%, with the amount calculated by reducing the NSR royalty 
interest by the amount granted to the applicable third party. The total royalty burden shall not 
exceed 4.5%. MB shall retain a 1% NSR on all State of Wyoming Land Leases acquired within 
the area of interest.

The current Wyoming state land leases require Stockade Beaver Creek, Ltd. and P. A. Miller 
(underlying lease holders) to pay a royalty of 5% of the gross value of uranium-bearing ore 
mined and removed from the leased lands. Uranium content is to be determined using a weighted 
arithmetic average of uranium content on all lots of ore mined and removed from the leased 
lands during each calendar month, using standard sampling and analysis procedures. 

The Exploration Agreement with Option to Lease between the surface owners (Judy M. 
Greenwood and David H. Greenwood) and NCA Nuclear, Inc. lists the considerations for 
acquiring the right to enter the surface land and other rights. A signing bonus of $5,000 and the 
first year payment of $1 per acre of land included within the property are due during the first 
year (2006/2007). In subsequent years of the terms, NCA shall pay the owner $2 per acre of land 
included within the property in years 2 and 3 and $5 per acre in years 4 and 5. In addition, the 
agreement covers conduct of operations in accordance with sound mining and other applicable 
industry standards and practices and in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local 
laws, regulations and ordinances, including those relating to mining and protection of the 
environment. NCA also agreed to compensate the owner for loss of agricultural production and 
for lost land value of $100 per acre (of disturbance) per year. NCA also agreed to diligently 
pursue to completion any reclamation of the subject property required by applicable law, 
including returning all surface disturbances to their original contour and re-seeding and 
establishing native or original preferred species. In the event NCA exercises its Option to Lease, 
it shall develop a reclamation plan for its mining operations with Wyoming Department of 
Environmental Quality in accordance with applicable law. 

 

2.4 Environmental Liabilities 
According to the exploration agreement, "MB knows of no pre-existing, environmental 
hazardous conditions on the premises, including surface disturbances, solid wastes, hazardous 
wastes, water pollution, or eminent public health or safety hazard, nor any known or unknown 
cultural, historic or prehistoric sites or artifacts on the premises." 

There are existing surface disturbances in the Busfield and Vickers uranium mine portions of the 
project area, dating from mining activities in the 1950s. Existing disturbance includes shallow 
open pits and waste dumps of the historic mines, as well as other small-scale pits and trenches. 
Drilling activities have been conducted at the Busfield mine area without the need for drill roads 
and with minimal surface disturbance. 

Existing environmental liabilities are not described in any of the project files. The author is not a 
Qualified Person with respect to environmental issues; however, a brief site visit indicates the 
primary environmental liability that might exist would be related to historical surface disturbance

Elkhorn NI 43-101_Final_18Apr07.doc   

and any related reclamation obligations. Drill access roads, drill sites, and open pits were largely 
left un-reclaimed, as was the standard industry practice at the time of the mining activity in the 
late 1950s and early 1960s. The drilled sites observed at the Busfield mine area are on privately-
owned surface lands, which were accessed under agreement with the surface owners. It is 
presumed that an accommodation with the land holders satisfied reclamation obligations of prior 
exploration groups.  

 

2.5 Permits 
Exploration agreements are in place between NCA Nuclear and the owners of the pre-existing 
mining claims and between NCA Nuclear and the surface owners. The state lands are also 
covered by state leases. 

Permits to conduct drilling in Wyoming are administered by the Wyoming Department of 
Environmental Quality (WDEQ). Permits to conduct exploration drilling on BLM lands require 
either a Notice of Intent or a Plan of Operations; depending upon the amount of new surface 
disturbance that is planned. A Notice of Intent is for planned surface activities that anticipate less 
than 5.0 acres of surface disturbance, and usually can be obtained within a 30 to 60 day time 
period. A Plan of Operations will be required if there is greater than 5.0 acres of new surface 
disturbance involved with the planned exploration work. A Plan of Operations can take several 
months to be approved, depending on the nature of the intended work, the level of reclamation 
bonding required, the need for archeological surveys, and other factors as may be determined by 
the BLM. Permits for BLM lands are also administered through the WDEQ. NCA nuclear 
obtained permits for the November and December 2006 drilling, in a very short time frame as 
minimal surface disturbance was involved. 

 

2.5.1 Required Permits and Status 
A Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) Drilling Notification (permit) No. 
DN347 was issued to NCA Nuclear, Inc. on October 6, 2006, for approximately 8 drill holes on 
the Busfield property. That application was amended and approved on December 13, 2006, to 
include approximately 60 additional drill holes.

3 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure & Physiography (Item 7) 

3.1 Access to Property 
The Hulett area properties of the Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project are accessed by driving 
west from Rapid City, South Dakota, or east from Sheridan, Wyoming, along U.S. Interstate 
Highway 90 (Figure 3-1). The Hulett-Elkhorn area is accessed through paved highways north 
and west from U.S. Highway 14 north off Interstate 90 near Sundance, northwest to Carlile 
Junction, then north past Devils Tower on State Highway 24 to the town of Hulett (Figure 3-2).  

Access to the property begins on State Highway 24 0.3 miles south of Hulett, turning west on a 
paved county road for 1.3 miles, then turning left on a major graded gravel county road 4.6 miles 
northwest to a road intersection, continuing straight through the intersection an additional 6.8 
miles on graded gravel road, then left (west) onto a two-track dirt road access for 0.6 miles to the 
Busfield historical open pit mine. The last section of the 0.6 mile two-track road crosses over the 
Busfield mine area mineralization drilled by NCA Nuclear (Figure 3-3). 

 

3.2 Climate 
The regional climate is semiarid, with hot, relatively dry summers and cold winters. According 
to the Western Regional Climate Center (srcc@dri.edu), the average annual precipitation at 
Hulett, Wyoming, from 1948 through 2005 was 16.79 inches, with most of the precipitation 
occurring during the late spring and early fall. The average maximum temperature at the Hulett 
station during the winter months was between 34 and 45°F and during the summer months was 
between 77 and 86°F. The average minimum temperature at the Hulett station during the winter 
months was between 8 and 19°F and during the summer months was between 48 and 51°F 
(www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliRECtM.pl?wy4760).  

Range grasses, sagebrush, and sparse cacti cover the flat areas. Evergreens commonly form a 
dense cover on north-facing slopes and along some canyon walls. South-facing slopes underlain 
by shale support a heavy growth of evergreens and south-facing slopes underlain by sandstone 
are commonly grass-covered. 

 

3.3 Physiography 
The physiography of the Elkhorn project area is characterized by an undulating surface that dips 
gently to the northwest following the regional dip of the strata, with local structures that modify 
the regional dip. The topography is determined by the erosion characteristics of the cliff and 
ledge-forming sandstones and the slope-forming shales. The area is drained through north- and 



Northern Canadian Minerals, Inc.  3-2 
Elkhorn Project  Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project, Wyoming

Elkhorn NI 43-101_Final_18Apr07.doc   

northwestward-flowing creeks, Elkhorn, Tie, and Bronco John creeks, which flow down the dip-
slope of the strata into the Little Missouri River to the northwest. Where streams have been 
incised into sandstone beds, canyon and divide topography has formed, but where streams drain 
softer shale areas, a rolling hilly surface has been developed. 

Total relief of the Strawberry Hill quadrangle is approximately 835 feet. Altitudes range from 
about 3,620 ft amsl along the Little Missouri River in the northwest corner of the quadrangle, to 
4,455 ft amsl on top of Strawberry Hill. Local relief is generally 150 to 200 ft. 

 

3.4 Local Resources & Infrastructure 
Hulett is the nearest town, with a population of only a few hundred to less than 500 for the 
general area. Local infrastructure access is good, truck freight can access the area, in support of 
the lumber mill at Hulett. Local personnel can provide unskilled labor. Regionally, Wyoming has 
several large towns that act as mining-related service centers such as Gillette, which is some 80 
miles to the southwest and which is in the center of large-scale coal mining operations. 
Elsewhere in Wyoming, the town of Casper, central to the state, has traditionally offered mining 
and oil- and gas-related services such as drilling service companies and equipment suppliers. 

Rapid City, South Dakota, is located approximately 120 miles to the east, on the east side of the 
Black Hills. This population center of about 50,000 has available additional services, such as a 
semi-skilled and skilled labor force, including some mine-experienced labor that formerly 
worked at the historical Homestake gold mine of Lead, South Dakota. Water and power are 
available in the region, although not present on the Elkhorn Property in the vicinity of the 
historical Busfield Mine. 

   

3.4.1 Access Road 
Access to the historical Busfield Mine, as previously described, includes only 0.6 miles of two-
track dirt road across fee surface lands for which NCA Nuclear has an access/use agreement. The 
access from there is on maintained, graded gravel roads that are part of the public access for the 
region of local ranches (Figure 3-4).  

 

3.4.2 Water Supply 
There are no surface waters in the immediate area of the Busfield Mine, and creeks are 
ephemeral. Groundwater, while present in drill holes, is not sufficiently defined as to quantity or 
quality. There are reservoirs, groundwater resources, and rivers in the region, within 20 to 30 
miles or less of the Elkhorn Property.

Elkhorn NI 43-101_Final_18Apr07.doc   

3.4.3 Electrical Power Supply 
There is a high-voltage regional electrical grid in the region, some 20 to 30 miles to the south 
near Interstate highway 90. However, there is no local power to the Elkhorn property except for 
minimal domestic use at local ranches. 

 

3.4.4 Buildings & Ancillary Facilities 
There are no buildings or ancillary facilities on the Elkhorn exploration project in areas of 
exploration activity. Local ranch houses and out-buildings are in the region and within the 
property Area of Interest.

4 History (Item 8) 
No uranium mining has occurred since the late 1960s in the Black Hills area. Total production 
from the northern Black Hills region is approximately 2.5 million pounds U3O8. The average 
grade of the historic production was approximately 0.2% U3O8.  

 

4.1 Past Exploration & Development 
The Hulett area was prospected for uranium during the initial uranium boom in the 1950s, in the 
mid-1970s, and again in 2005-2007. Two mines, the Busfield Mine and Vickers Mine, were 
important uranium producers in 1956-1957. The following information is from Davis and Izett 
(1962). 

 

4.1.1 History of Discovery and Development 
Anomalous radioactivity was first discovered and reported from this area by the Atomic Energy 
Commission's (AEC) airborne survey in 1952. Soon after publication of the anomalies by the 
AEC, Messrs. William and Richard Busfield of Belle Fourche, South Dakota, staked five claims 
which included the site of the mining operations at the Busfield and Vickers mines (MacPherson, 
1956, RME-1074).  

In the summer of 1954, AEC reconnaissance crews made a detailed study of the area and located 
six drill sites. The holes were collared in the upper Fall River Formation and bottomed in the top 
of the Morrison Formation of Jurassic age to determine the nature of the sedimentary rocks and 
their potential for uranium ore. As a result of the drilling completed in August 1954, the area was 
considered to have a good potential.  

The Sodak Uranium and Mining Company leased the claims from the Busfields and started an 
extensive wagon- and core-drilling program in the summer of 1955. After blocking out several 
thousand tons of 0.20 percent U308, a large open cut was made to the mineralized horizon, and 
finally, operations extended to underground mining. About 750 tons of material were shipped to 
the Edgemont buying station of the AEC. The drilling and mining operations were suspended in 
late December 1955, because of adverse weather conditions and high water content of the ore. 
The 1956 estimate of the size of the deposit was 17,000 tons of ore at 0.23 percent U308.  

Surface outcropping uranium mineralization was mined at Busfield in the 1950s. A roughly 
circular pit approximately 300 feet in diameter and 45 feet in depth remains open at the mine 
site. Production records have not been available.

Renewed exploration drilling at Busfield began in the mid-late 1960s. At the time Federal 
Resources took control of the property in 1969, approximately 90 shallow bore holes had been 
completed in a 250 by 100 meter mineralized area extending southeast from the southeast edge 
of the historic pit. Gamma log data from these completed holes were not available to Federal. 
Federal gamma logged the still open boreholes in 1969 and 1970.  Shallow to nearly outcropping 
uranium mineralization  was detected in the gamma logs.  

Federal Resources continued the drill exploration of the southeast extension ore zone beginning 
in 1970. The combined pre-Federal and Federal exploration programs in the southeast extension 
ore zone totals total approximately 175 holes. The data from the holes has been re-assembled 
from archives stored at the Marriot Library at the University of Utah in (Figure 4-1). 

Regional exploration was sporadic in the area of the Elkhorn Project until the early 1970s. Many 
widely scattered drill holes are shown on some historical maps, apparently exploring the concept 
of regional down-dip "roll-front" type uranium mineralization in the Fall River Formation, the 
same host to mineralization at the Busfield and Vickers mines. Subsequent exploration in the 
mid-1970s was conducted as exploration drilling by several companies at the Busfield and 
Vickers mine sites and in the surrounding area. Exploration companies included Susquehanna, 
Federal Resources, and Pioneer Metals. 

 

4.2 Historic Mineral Resource Estimates 
The Busfield and Vickers mines, near the west-central edge of the Strawberry Hill quadrangle, 
were two of the larger uranium producers in the northern Black Hills. Up to October 1957, each 
of these mines had produced 9,000 tons or more of uranium ore, and the main ore bodies, as then 
defined, had virtually been mined out. According to the records of the Atomic Energy 
Commission through 1957 (Davis and Izett, 1962), the Busfield mine had produced 
approximately 9,000 tons of ore containing 0.17 percent U3O8, and the Vickers mine had 
produced between 9,000 and 10,000 tons of ore containing 0.18 percent U308. In 1962, these 
mines were thought to be mined out.  

Copies of historical reports and data were retrieved by NCA Nuclear from the Marriott Library 
Special Collection archives at the University of Utah. An un-authored "Ore Reserve" tabulation 
was among the historical data, dated 1972, and presented the following:

The historical data that supports the above stated "reserves" is incomplete, and insufficiently 
described to reconcile with current resource/reserve classification. The data supporting those 
reserve numbers was not reviewed by a qualified person; therefore, the reserve numbers should 
not be relied upon. NCA Nuclear is not reporting these numbers as reserves or resources. NCA 
Nuclear is reporting current and NI 43-101 compliant resources as stated in Section 15 of this

4.2.1 Busfield Mine 
The Busfield mine is near the west edge of the quadrangle in the SW ¼ of See. 26, T. 56 N., 
R.66W. According to MacPherson (1956) of the AEC, anomalous radioactivity at the Busfield 
deposit was discovered in 1952 by airborne reconnaissance by the Commission. Messrs. William 
and Richard Busfield staked claims shortly thereafter in the area which included the deposit. In 
1954 the AEC drilled holes which indicated that ore-grade material was present in the area. The 
Sodak Uranium and Mining Co. of Hot Springs, S. Dakota, then leased the property from the 
Busfields and carried out an intensive drilling program that outlined the ore body. After the 
initial open-cut was made to the ore zone, mining progressed underground and the mine was 
worked until December 1955. 

In the spring of 1956, the Sodak Uranium and Mining Co. decided that because of the blanket-
like configuration of the ore body and the possibility of caving because of the open joints in the 
sandstone overlying the ore body, an open-pit operation would be faster, safer, and more 
economical. During the summer of 1956, the overburden was stripped, and the ore was mined by 
open-pit methods. Removal of the ore body was completed and the mine closed down in 1957. 
The outline of the open-cut as it was in September 1956 is shown on the geologic map of the 
mine area (pl. 4 of the Strawberry Hill Quadrangle, USGS Bulletin 1127, Davis and Izett, 1962), 
and is unchanged to this day.

4.2.2 Vickers Mine 
The Vickers mine is near the west edge of the Strawberry Hill quadrangle in the NW 1/4 of Sec. 
26, T. 56 N., R. 66 W. (pl. 1 of Davis and Izett, 1962). The Vickers deposit, half a mile to the 
northwest of the Busfield deposit, was discovered after the Busfield deposit. Messrs. Sheffield 
and McLean in the spring of 1956 discovered ore-grade material in a drill hole. No surface 
indications of an ore body had been noted. The ground was leased and an intensive drilling 
program begun by an organization that later became the Hilmer-Tessem Uranium Corp. 
Stripping was begun in August 1956, and by mid-winter the major part of the ore body had been 
mined out. The outline of the open pit as it was in September 1956 is shown on plate 4 of Davis 
and Izett (1962). By the summer of 1957, the pit had been nearly doubled in size and another 
small pit had been opened over an area of high radioactivity to the northeast (pl. 4 of Davis and 
Izett, 1962). It has been reported that another operator worked the mine on a small scale during 
the winter of 1957-58 (Davis and Izett, 1962). 

There are several other historical uranium occurrences and small mines in the project area, and 
the historical Hauber Mine is located adjacent to NCA-controlled land in the southwestern end of 
the Area of Interest. These historical mines and occurrences confirm the exploration potential in 
the region, but do not have immediate bearing on the resource defined by NCA Nuclear's drilling 
at the Busfield Mine area, and are therefore not discussed here

5 Geologic Setting (Item 9) 
The following discussion on geology and mineralization in the area of the Elkhorn Project and 
specifically the Busfield and Vickers mines is extracted largely from the Geology and Uranium 
Deposits of the Strawberry Hill Quadrangle, Crook County, Wyoming (Davis and Izett, 1962). 

 

5.1 Regional Geology 
The geologic map of northeastern Wyoming (Figure 5-1:) is dominated by the northwest-
trending Black Hills uplift of Wyoming and South Dakota. In terms of the sedimentary rocks 
influenced, this doubly plunging anticline is 200 miles long in a north-northwest – southeast 
direction by about 75 miles wide in a southwest-northeast direction. This Laramide tectonic 
feature was emplaced between 65 million years ago (Ma) and 56 Ma along earlier Precambrian 
zones of weakness. The intrusion of Laramide igneous rocks and subduction-related tectonic 
forces bowed up the Cretaceous through Paleocene sedimentary rocks in north- and northwest-
facing monoclinal folds dipping gently west away from the igneous cores. The tectonism 
accompanied emplacement of stocks, dikes, sills, and laccoliths of alkalic and alkali-calcic 
composition between 62 to 50 Ma (Lisenbee and DeWitt, 1993). Paleocene and older strata were 
deformed by the uplift and Oligocene strata were not. 

Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks consist of marine shelf-facies limestones and shales 
and continental sandstones and finer-grained clastic rocks (Table 5-1). The Cretaceous foreland 
basin sediments record the filling of the craton-ward basin adjacent to the Cretaceous fold-thrust 
belt and Laramide volcanic centers in the western U.S. In Late Albian (mid-Cretaceous at about 
100 Ma), a persistent interior seaway advanced from east to west and from south to north, 
eventually extending from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. As this seaway transgressed, 
the continental alluvial fan deposits in the west were replaced with marginal marine shoreline 
sandstones and deltaic shales and eventually with marine shales.  

As the sea level rose and fell during the mid- and Late Cretaceous, these fluvial and marginal 
marine environments alternated. When the rates of seafloor spreading increased, the mid-ocean 
ridges bulged, sending the seas advancing over the flat-lying topography. As the rates of seafloor 
spreading decreased, sea level dropped and the seas regressed, causing the deposition of fluvial 
sandstones overlying marine shales (Steidtmann, 1993).  

The alternation of fluvial sandstones and deltaic and marine shales created an ideal environment 
for the later deposition of uranium. As the uranium moved in groundwater through the 
sandstones, it was channeled by the impermeable shales above and below the sandstones. 
Uranium minerals were precipitated in the reducing environments influenced by the

carbonaceous material that had been deposited as plant material had accumulated in swampy 
environments or washed down to the shore. 

Stratigraphic units that host uranium mineralization in Wyoming include almost every 
stratigraphic unit and occur in every county. In northeastern Wyoming, uranium occurs in the 
geologic units listed in Table 5-2.  

 

5.2 Local Geology 
In the Hulett-Elkhorn area of interest, Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous formations crop out 
in a northeast-trending belt. These formations include the Jurassic Morrison Formation and the 
overlying Lower Cretaceous rocks of the Lakota Formation, Fall River Formation, Inyan Kara 
Group, Skull Creek Formation, Newcastle Sandstone, and Mowry Shale. The Morrison and 
Lakota Formations were deposited in a continental environment, the Fall River Formation in a 
marginal marine environment, and the Skull Creek and Newcastle and younger formations in a 
marine environment. 

These strata dip gently to the northwest, away from the Black Hills uplift. Near the project area, 
numerous small, northeast-trending, down-to-the-northwest, normal faults crop out in the 
southern part of the area of interest. Superimposed on the regional northwest dip are small folds, 
joints, and faults that trend N60°E with cross-structures trending approximately N25°W. The 
structure map of the top of the Fall River Formation is shown on Figure 5-2. The Little Missouri 
River cuts through the northwestern corner of the area and Quaternary alluvium occurs in its 
valley.  

The following discussion on rocks and mineralization in the area of the Busfield and Vickers 
mines is summarized from the Geology and Uranium Deposits of the Strawberry Hill 
Quadrangle, Crook County, Wyoming (Davis and Izett, 1962). 

 

5.2.1 Local Lithology/Stratigraphy 
The sequence of sedimentary rock types in the area of the Busfield and Vickers mines represents 
a gradual change from a continental environment during the Late Jurassic to a marine 
environment during the Early Cretaceous.  The generalized columnar section for northern Crook 
County is shown on Figure 5-3.

5.2.1.1 Morrison Formation (Group) 
The Morrison Formation consists of a succession of variegated (black, green, and maroon) 
claystone, shale, or mudstone with a few discontinuous limestone and sandstone interbeds. No 
anomalous radioactivity or uranium minerals were found (Figure 5-2 of RME 1074). The 
Morrison is overlain by the Lakota Formation. 

 

5.2.1.2 Lakota Formation 
The Lakota Formation of Lower Cretaceous age consists of 80 to 220 feet of complexly lensing 
and interfingering, variegated claystone, siltstone, shale, sandstone, and conglomerate. The bulk 
of the Lakota is silty, sandy, and granular claystones. The shales are varicolored (dark to light 
gray, greenish gray, maroon, purple, and yellow) and impervious. The sandstones are coarse to 
medium grained and very porous, but sometimes contain abundant interstitial clay. 
Conglomerates in the Lakota Formation consist almost entirely of chert pebbles in a matrix of 
medium-grained, generally loosely cemented sand. The sediments of the Lakota Formation were 
deposited in various continental environments, including channel, flood plain, lacustrine, and 
swamp environments. 

Although the Lakota contains ore-grade material in other localities in the northern Black Hills, 
no abnormal radioactivity was observed in the drill holes in the Strawberry Hill quadrangle in 
drilling before 1962 (Davis and Izett, 1962). 

The Fuson shale was originally separated from the Lakota Formation (Darton, 1909), but is now 
included as an upper member of the Lakota. The shale unit is 70 to 130 feet thick and consists of 
varicolored mudstone and siltstone and a few thin interbedded sandstones. No anomalous 
radioactivity was encountered in these sedimentary rocks in the drill holes (Davis and Izett, 
1962). The predominance of mudstone and siltstone minimizes the favorability of the Fuson as a 
host formation for uranium ores.  

The Lakota Formation is disconformably overlain by the Fall River Formation in a transgressive 
disconformity. A few feet below the disconformity is a zone of siderite spherulites that weather 
to limonite specks. The lowermost resistant bed of the Fall River is a white weathering, one-foot 
thick bed of siltstone about 3 to 4 feet above the contact. 

 

5.2.1.3 Fall River Formation 
The Fall River Formation is interpreted to have been deposited in a wave-dominated deltaic 
environment with northwest transport direction into the southern edge of the Williston basin. 
Thick sand sections occur where branch distribution channels diverge from primary channels.

The primary and secondary sand channel system of the delta is mapped through the Elkhorn 
project area. 

The Lakota/Fall River fluvial section is bounded by claystone/mudstone units of the Jurassic 
Morrison below and by the Skull Creek Shale above. A regionally prominent shaley silt horizon 
in the contact zone of the Lakota with the overlying lower Fall River provides an additional fluid 
barrier. These enveloping units are impermeable and have focused water flow into the enclosed 
fluvial section. This geometry is favorable for in situ leach (ISL) extraction methods for uranium 
mineralization occurring below the current water table. 

Additional meter-scale silt-shale units also occur within both the lower Fall River and underlying 
Lakota formations. Decimeter-scale silty and carbonaceous interbeds have been observed to be 
strongly mineralized in the Busfield pit.  

Sand channel deposits that host uranium mineralization in the Elkhorn area are deformed by 
three dominant structural elements in the Elkhorn area: regional north-northwest dip off the 
Black Hills uplift; northeast-trending normal faults of the Little Missouri Fracture Zone; and 
domal and anticlinal closures. 

The Fall River sandstone consists of 130 to 170 feet (125 to 145 feet in the Strawberry Hill 
quadrangle) of carbonaceous clayey siltstone and even-bedded sandstone deposited at the margin 
of an Early Cretaceous seaway. The sandstone is light gray, massive to thin bedded, very fine to 
medium grained, and weathers to yellowish brown. As the sandstone is more resistant to erosion 
than the interbedded shale and siltstone, vertical sandstone cliffs have been formed along 
Elkhorn Canyon. The shale and siltstones are obscured by a heavy cover of talus. In the drill 
core, the shale and siltstone are laminated light to dark gray and contain carbon flakes and 
abundant mica. The uppermost sandstone of the Fall River is the ore-bearing stratum and 
contains anomalous radioactivity throughout the area. 

At the mine, the Fall River sandstone is 30 to 110 feet thick and thins to 10 feet and less 
elsewhere. Lithologically, the sandstone is light gray, massive, fine to medium grained, and 
weathers to yellowish brown. Well-developed cross bedding is present throughout the entire 
section. The sandstone is composed of quartz and subordinate amounts of feldspar and mica. The 
lower part of the sandstone contains thin lignitic stringers that are relatively hard and break with 
a blocky cleavage. 

In the Strawberry Hill quadrangle, the Fall River Formation was informally subdivided into a 
lower member (topped by the Keyhole sandstone member) and an upper unit of claystone, 
siltstone, and sandstone. 

The lower part of the lower unit ranges from 20 to 50 feet in thickness and consists of dark gray, 
carbonaceous siltstone and a few thin-bedded sandstones near the top. The upper part of the

Elkhorn NI 43-101_Final_18Apr07.doc   

lower unit consists of the Keyhole sandstone member, which is 0 to 35 feet thick and forms a 
prominent cliff. 

The upper unit of the Fall River Formation consists mainly of slope-forming, interlaminated, 
dark gray, silty claystone and clayey siltstone in the lower part and of light brown, ledge- and 
cliff-forming siltstone and very fine-grained sandstone in the upper part. The upper unit ranges 
between 40 and 55 feet in thickness. Locally, the sandstone in the upper unit thickens to form 
lenses that interfinger with and rest on silty claystone and clayey siltstone. This sandstone unit is 
the host for the uranium ore in the Busfield mine area. 

The ore-bearing sandstone is gradationally overlain by small remnants of greasy, slightly silty 
shale of the Skull Creek Formation. The transition zone between the Fall River and overlying 
Skull Creek shale consists of interlaminated, dark gray, silty claystone and clayey siltstone, 
commonly jarosite-stained, with a few intercalated, light brown siltstone laminae. 

NCA geologists have interpreted the environment of deposition of the Fall River Formation as 
that of wave-dominated deltaic environment responsible for the sandstone beds with the 
interbedded shale horizons representing over-bank sedimentation. Nearshore marginal-marine 
and deltaic environments exhibit both laminar and cross-bedded sandstone units that are thought 
to represent nearshore tidal inlet environments where the bedding is developed by wave action 
and storm events (Clifton, Hunter and Phillips, 1971). 

 

5.2.1.4 Skull Creek Shale 
The Skull Creek Formation of Lower Cretaceous age is the oldest formation of the Colorado 
group. The Skull Creek shale is a black, fissile, slightly silty, very soft, marine shale that is 
approximately 200-feet thick and conformably overlies the Fall River sandstone. Erosion has 
removed most of the Skull Creek shale except for a few isolated hills and high timbered ridges in 
the western part of the area. No significant radioactivity or uranium minerals have been detected 
in the Skull Creek shale (Davis and Izett, 1962).  

 

5.2.2 Igneous Rocks 
No plutonic igneous rocks are exposed in the Elkhorn area, although nepheline syenite (phonolite 
and trachyphonolite) are exposed in monoliths at Devils Tower, which is 17 miles south of the 
Elkhorn project and at Missouri Buttes, which is 4 miles to the northwest of Devils Tower. These 
plutons or eroded laccoliths are predominantly alkalic, iron-rich, metaluminous to slightly 
peraluminous igneous rocks and many are fine-grained and porphyritic. Although beginning at 
about 62 Ma, the majority of the igneous activity occurred between 50 and 58 Ma (Lisenbee and 
DeWitt, 1993).

5.2.3 Alteration 
Uranium deposits of reduced uranium (coffinite and uraninite) become oxidized when not 
protected below the water table. The oxidized uranium deposits consist of carnotite and 
tyuyamunite. 

 

5.2.4 Structure 
The rocks in the area dip gently northwest away from the main Black Hills uplift in northeastern 
Wyoming and northwestern South Dakota. Superimposed on the regional dip are small folds, 
joints, and small faults. A set of domes is aligned N60°E and N20-25°W, which is parallel to 
those in the central Black Hills. 

The sedimentary rocks described from the Strawberry Hills quadrangle are part of the broad 
cuestas that border the northern end of the Black Rills uplift. The regional dip is to the north at 
the rate of about 1°. Many local variations in dip, which probably represent small anticlinal and 
synclinal flexures, are superimposed on the regional structure.  

Structures occurring near the Busfield mine consist of a few low flexures having dips rarely 
exceeding 5°. The uranium deposit lies near the top of a small flexure that may be part of the 
larger anticline crossing the northern part of Sec. 26, T.56N., R.66W.  

Structure contours on top of the Fall River Formation show that the mineralization lies near the 
crest of a small anticlinal flexure. Abrupt changes in dip occur away from the mineralization on 
all sides except the northwest. Coincident with the change in dip, the isopachs indicate a marked 
decrease in the thickness of the mineralized sandstone not far from the deposit. It is possible that 
the sudden change of dip and a lateral thinning of the upper Fall River sandstone formed a locus 
for deposition of the ore.  

Small faults cut the mineralization at several places and are visible at the end of the south drift. 
Because of the small distance between them, only a few of the faults could be seen. The 
maximum vertical displacement noted on any one fault was 2 feet. The faults appear to die out a 
short distance below the mineralized horizon. Lenses of coffinite have been displaced and some 
have been dragged along the fault. It seems evident that the faults developed after the sediments 
were consolidated and after the uranium mineralization was deposited. The faults may be much 
younger than the major tectonic elements in the area. Two main joint patterns, striking northeast 
and northwest, have had some control over the concentration of the secondary mineralization, 
but no relationship between the joints and the primary mineralization has been noted. Carnotite, 
metatyuyamunite, and hematite often occur together as bands paralleling the joint surfaces. No

particular direction of jointing seems to have been especially favorable for the concentration of 
these minerals.

6 Deposit Types (Item 10) 
The uranium deposits in the Elkhorn regions are characteristic of the Rocky Mountain and 
Intermontane Basin uranium province, United States (Finch, 1996). The uranium province is 
essentially defined by the extent of the Laramide uplifts and basins.  

Roll-front sandstone uranium deposits formed in the basins in Tertiary continental fluvial basins 
developed between uplifts. These ore deposits were formed by oxidizing uranium-bearing 
groundwaters that entered the host sandstone from the edges of the basins. Two possible sources 
of the uranium were (1) uraniferous Precambrian granite that provided sediment for the host 
sandstone and (2) overlying Tertiary age (Oligocene) volcanic ash sediments. Major uranium 
deposits occur as sandstone deposits in Cretaceous and Tertiary age basin sediments.  

Key deposit clusters and districts include the following:  Powder River Basin, Gas Hills, Shirley 
Basin, Crooks Gap, and Great Divide Basin (Red Desert) districts in Wyoming. Cluster size and 
grades for the sandstone deposits range from 500 to 20,000 tons U3O8, at grades of 0.04 to 0.23 
percent U3O8. The Black Hills area is host to known uranium deposits and occurrences in the 
Hulett area as well as the Aladdin area and the Dewey-Edgemont District on the  southwestern 
side of the Black Hills.  

The tectono-stratigraphic setting for roll-front uranium ores is in arkosic and fluvial sandstone 
formations deposited in small basins developed by Laramide uplifts. Host rocks are continental 
fluvial and nearshore sandstone. The principal ages of the host rocks are Early Cretaceous (144–
97 Ma), Eocene (52–36 Ma), and Oligocene (36–24 Ma), with epochs of mineralization at 70 
Ma, 35–26 Ma, and 3 Ma. 

Ore mineralogy consists of uraninite, pitchblende, coffinite, and carnotite, with associated 
vanadium in some deposits. Typical alteration in the roll-front sandstone deposit includes 
oxidation of iron minerals up-dip from the front and reduction of iron minerals down-dip along 
advancing redox interface boundaries (Figure 6-1).

Probable sources of uranium in the sandstone deposits are Oligocene volcanic ash and/or 
Precambrian granite (2,900–2,600 Ma). Mineralizing solutions in the sandstone are oxygen-
bearing groundwater. Uranium mineralization of the sandstone deposits began with inception of 
Laramide uplift (approximately 70 Ma) and peaked in Oligocene. 

Size and shape of individual deposits can vary from small pod-like replacement bodies to 
elongate lobes of mineralization along the regional redox boundary. 

 

6.1 Origins of the Deposits 
The deposits are the result of precipitation of uranium from ground-water solutions that moved 
through a system of saturated or partly saturated aquifers. The deposits studied are now, 
however, all above the permanent regional groundwater table. Some deposits are related to local 
perched water bodies and the minerals within them have remained largely in their low-valence 
state, whereas others are now in the zone of oxidation and hexavalent uranium minerals 
predominate. 

The Busfield and Vickers deposits are so situated that it can be assumed that the minerals in both 
deposits probably were precipitated from the same solutions and under approximately the same 
conditions. The uranium was probably derived from a source not known, but probably located

above the site of deposition, either up-dip within the Fall River Formation, or within the 
overlying sediments, or perhaps both, and was carried into the area by migrating ground-water 
solutions. Alkaline groundwater is favored as the transporting medium. The slight local etching 
of quartz and the occurrence of carbonate cement in the highest siltstone at the Vickers mine 
indicates carbonate or bicarbonate solutions. 

The close and consistent association of coffinite and carbonaceous debris, with or without pyrite, 
indicates that carbonaceous material played an important part in precipitating uranium from 
solution. The ability of organic material to extract uranium from solution in reducing 
environments has been demonstrated experimentally. It has been suggested that uranium may 
combine with organic matter as an organic uranium complex, which is very insoluble except 
under extreme acid conditions.  

The present assemblage of carbonaceous material, pyrite, and low valence uranium minerals in 
the ore zone, along with the absence of oxidized uranium minerals indicates that the 
mineralization was deposited in a reducing environment that has persisted to the present. The 
uranium-bearing carbonate or bicarbonate solutions migrated into this reducing environment, 
and, in the presence of H2S or other reducing agents produced by decaying organic matter, iron 
was precipitated as pyrite, and uranium was precipitated mostly as coffinite. The reactive silica 
needed for the formation of coffinite either was present in the ore-bearing solutions or was made 
available by the action of the solutions on quartz grains at the site of deposition. 

After the low-valence uranium minerals and probably some low valence vanadium minerals had 
been deposited, subsequent lowering of the regional water table brought the upper part of the 
deposit at the Busfield mine into an oxidizing environment. The perched body of water allowed 
the reducing environment to persist in the lower part of this deposit and in the deposit at the 
Vickers mine. Iron oxides and hexavalent uranium minerals, which occur above the ore zone at 
the Busfield mine, were formed in the oxidizing environment. There has been little apparent 
oxidation of the Vickers deposit, which was protected by a relatively impervious cover.  

NCA Nuclear interprets the geology of the uranium mineralization at Busfield as an exhumed 
roll-front deposit that is only partially remaining. The Busfield-Vickers uranium mineralization 
is interpreted to have been concentrated before the Fall Creek sandstone was brought to the 
surface and eroded. That is to say, the deposits formed at a redox boundary while the sandstone 
was buried and encased above and below by impermeable shale. Subsequent to roll-front style 
mineralization, the deposits were raised and exhumed and the vast majority of the roll-front's 
uranium was remobilized and 'robbed' from their original locations, leaving behind the remnants 
of the original mineralization that remained fixed by the presence of organic debris and/or local 
water tables, resulting in the Busfield and Vickers deposits. SRK concurs with this interpretation.

During oxidation of the upper part of the Busfield deposit, secondary enrichment of the low-
valence ores occurred. The added uranium was derived largely, though perhaps not entirely, by 
preferential leaching from the zone of oxidation, and this process probably continues. The 
suggestion of secondary enrichment of uranium arises partly from a study of the vanadium-
uranium ratios. In general, the vanadium-uranium ratios in samples from the Busfield deposit are 
higher than those in samples from the Vickers deposit; the ratios in samples of oxidized material 
from the Busfield deposit are highest of all. 

Preferential leaching and migration of uranium has taken place, probably recently, and supports 
the hypothesis that secondary enrichment of the low-valence deposits has occurred. The 
inference from the available evidence is that the low-valence minerals were deposited when the 
host rocks were saturated or partly saturated aquifers below the regional ground-water table. 

 

6.2 Controls on Mineralization 
The factors which controlled the emplacement of these ore deposits can be divided into two 
general groups, sedimentary and tectonic. Sedimentary features include the lithologic character 
of the host rock and the sedimentary structures in a potential ore-bearing interval. Tectonic 
features include joints, faults, and folds on both regional and local scales. The sedimentary 
features seem to have a rather clearly defined relation to the deposits, and are probably the 
dominant control in localizing the ore minerals. Tectonic structures probably exerted a gross 
control rather than a finite control, in that structural features directed and modified the flow of 
mineralizing solutions through a system of aquifers within which sedimentary structure and 
composition of the rock were locally favorable for deposition. 

The composition of the host rock, along with the chemical environment it produced locally, was 
probably the most important factor localizing the deposits studied. The abundance of 
carbonaceous material and its intimate association with low-valence uranium minerals and 
locally with pyrite, indicate that organic matter, through its decay and attendant formation of H2S 
or other reducing agents within a zone of ground-water saturation, produced the reducing 
environment necessary for reducing the uranyl ion from solution and also acted as a collecting 
agent for uranium. No uranium minerals accumulated where carbonaceous debris was not 
present. 

The differences in the proportions of detrital constituents also controlled the differences in 
texture of the host rock, which in turn influenced the rate of flow of migrating ground-water 
solutions. The presence of clay in the interstices of the well-sorted, even-grained sandstone 
reduced the permeability and thereby helped to retard the rate of flow of groundwater within the

geochemically favorable zones. It is believed that restricting the rate of flow of mineralizing 
solution locally might be an important factor in enhancing uranium precipitation. 

The textural differences, principally differing grain size, between the ore-bearing sandstone and 
the underlying units have been responsible for preserving the ore. Without the local water body 
perched on the impervious unit beneath the ore-bearing sandstone, the ore would have been 
oxidized and the uranium probably would have been flushed away from the site of the deposit. 

Sedimentary structures, which include abnormal changes in thickness of otherwise favorable 
intervals, and irregularities in the bottom surface of such intervals, probably exerted some 
influence on ore deposition. The major contribution of such features probably was to help control 
the direction and rate of local groundwater flow. The long axis of the abnormally thick sandstone 
lens that contains the Busfield deposit trended nearly at right angles to the regional structure. The 
lens probably functioned as a natural conduit that diverted large quantities of migrating solutions 
toward its lower, or west, end. Partial damming at its lower end, caused by thinning and perhaps 
in part by its irregular bottom surface, retarded the rate of flow, and thus added favorable 
groundwater conditions to an already lithologically favorable site. The abnormal thickening of 
the sandstone interval in the vicinity of the Vickers deposit also may have been the favorable 
solution-control factor at that site.  

In summary, the composition and texture of the host rock, the distribution of zones of reducing 
environments, and sedimentary structures within lithologically and chemically favorable 
intervals were the major controlling factors in localizing the ore deposits. Minor tectonic 
features, although they contributed to the development of favorable subsurface hydrologic 
conditions locally, probably were not requisite for localizing the ore.

7 Mineralization (Item 11) 
Concentrations of uraniferous material in the Strawberry Hill quadrangle are largely restricted to 
abnormally thick, permeable, carbonaceous, sandy intervals within the upper unit of the Fall 
River Formation. Sedimentary features, such as abnormal change in thickness of beds, may have 
been of major importance in localizing uranium deposits. The following description is taken 
from Davis and Izett (1962). 

The Busfield and Vickers deposits from which the ore was mined are two separate 
concentrations of black uranium minerals in or adjacent to an abnormally thick sandstone at the 
top of the upper unit of the Fall River Formation. Coffinite, the principal are mineral, is 
intimately associated with carbonaceous material and, locally, with abundant pyrite. The 
carbonaceous material is disseminated throughout the sandstone and concentrated in layers 
oriented along planes of stratification and cross-stratification. The upper part of one of the 
deposits is oxidized, but owing to a local perched water table, the major part of the deposits is 
unoxidized.  

Uranium probably was carried into the area by groundwater and precipitated from solution at a 
redox boundary or by decaying organic matter in a reducing environment. Precipitation and 
localization of uranium were controlled by the lithologic character of the host rock, sedimentary 
structures, and tectonic structures. The relationship of vanadium-uranium ratios to oxidized and 
unoxidized mineralized zones strongly suggests preferential leaching and migration of uranium. 
Also, the disequilibrium of equivalent uranium and chemical uranium as related to the intensity 
of oxidation of mineralized samples indicates enrichment of the primary uranium deposits.  

An age determination shows part of the uranium from a sample of unoxidized mineralization to 
be about 60,000 years old. This indicates Quaternary deposition of uranium, and the deposits are 
at present in a transitory state. 

 

7.1 Uranium Minerals in Elkhorn Area 
Uranium-bearing minerals at the Busfield deposit were identified by X-ray diffraction methods. 
The minerals identified are coffinite, uraninite, carnotite, and metatyuyamunite. Coffinite, the 
principal ore mineral, is found in the basal part of the upper Fall River sandstone. The carnotite-
type minerals are confined chiefly to the upper part of the sandstone, but small concentrations 
occur in the coffinite unit.  

The coffinite is found in very thin black layers and stringers that lie parallel to the bedding 
planes. Very closely spaced high-grade ore lenses constitute the mineralization. The lenses of ore 
are approximately 1 to 2 feet thick and are from 10 to 20 feet long.  



Northern Canadian Minerals, Inc.  7-2 
Elkhorn Project  Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project, Wyoming

Elkhorn NI 43-101_Final_18Apr07.doc   

The coffinite fills the interstices of the sandstone and coats the individual sand grains within each 
black layer. Although this is the predominant mode in which the coffinite occurs, it may also be 
present in the thin lignitic stringers in the ore zone. Occasionally nodules of marcasite or pyrite 
form nuclei that are surrounded by halos of coffinite. Carnotite-type minerals have not been 
found in sufficient quantity to form a mineable deposit. They occur sporadically through the 
upper 20 to 30 feet of the sandstone as interstitial fillings, grain coatings, and as "paint" on joint 
and fracture surfaces. Limonite stain is very heavy throughout the upper part of the sandstone 
and usually shows a marked increase near the secondary uranium-bearing minerals,  

The ore-bearing sandstone was probably deposited in a relatively narrow local basin or channel 
that existed during upper Fall River time. The upper Fall River sandstone is thicker in the region 
of the mineralization and rapidly thins toward the non-mineralized areas. The well-developed 
cross bedding and massive bedding that is so prominent in the thicker part of the sandstone gives 
way to very thin bedding and ripple marks in the thinner parts.  

In exposures at the mine, cross bedding dips southwestward, westward and northwestward, 
indicating that the depositing current was from the east. Information derived from closely spaced 
drilling done by the Sodak Mining Company shows that the trend of the mineralization follows 
the greater thickness of sandstone to the southeast. 

The coffinite ore lies within a lens of perched groundwater about 100 to 200 feet above the 
regional water table. The origin of the perched groundwater can probably be attributed to surface 
waters entering at the top of the porous ore-bearing sandstone, percolating through the numerous 
open joints and fissures, and collecting above the impermeable shale and siltstone which 
underlies the ore-bearing sandstone. The channel-like structure of the sandstone makes it a 
natural conduit for groundwater.  

The perched body of groundwater is responsible for the preservation of the primary coffinite ore 
so near the ground surface, in what is normally a highly oxidized zone. The top of the perched 
water table is 30 to 40 feet below the topographic surface and coincides closely with the upper 
limit of the coffinite and iron sulfides. The oxidized ore is found in association with limonite and 
hematite above the water table and extending to the surface. Within a narrow zone in which the 
water level fluctuated, coffinite, carnotite-type minerals, and limonite are found together.  

The passage and deposition of ore solutions also allowed a body of perched groundwater to form 
at the ore horizon. The trapped groundwater prevented the complete oxidation and removal of 
the primary ore. Sedimentary trends are to the east and southeast, whereas local tectonic 
structures strike northeastward. The intersection of the two trends could be the locus of 
additional uranium deposits.

The uranium deposits fall into two main categories: (1) oxidized deposits that occur above the 
ground-water table and consist principally of carnotite and tyuyamunite, and (2) unoxidized 
deposits that occur below the tops of perched ground-water tables and consist mainly of coffinite 
and possibly some uraninite. All deposits are associated with carbonaceous debris, either as 
finely divided fragments disseminated throughout the sandstone host rock or concentrated in thin 
layers along planes of stratification or cross-stratification. The deposits are all tabular, commonly 
irregular in plan, and concordant with the gross stratification of the host rock.  

The size of individual deposits varies markedly; horizontal dimensions range from tens to 
hundreds of feet. The thickness rarely is greater than 6 feet and averages probably about 4 feet. 
Similar deposits have been described in the southern Black Hills (Bell and Bales, 1955). 
Production of uranium from mines in the northern Black Hills through September 1957 was 
approximately 50,000 tons of ore with an average content, of about 0.2 percent U3O8. 

The Busfield and Vickers mine area lies west of Elkhorn Creek near the east base of a ridge of 
Skull Creek shale, the top of which is 80 to 100 feet above the ground surface at the mines. The 
few square miles that lie west of Elkhorn Creek and east of the Skull Creek ridge are referred to 
as the Elkhorn Creek mining area. 

The ore deposits at the Busfield and Vickers mines consisted of lenses and pods of sandstone 
impregnated with uranium minerals in the lower part of the sandstone interval in the upper unit 
of the Fall River Formation. The lenses and pods at the Busfield mine occur at the bottom of the 
thickest part of the sandstone lens and those at the Vickers mine occurred in a nearly normal 
thickness of sandstone but adjacent to an abnormally thick lens.  

The principal ore minerals are coffinite, which is a uranous silicate U(SiO4)1-x(OH)4x) (Stieff and 
others, 1956; Fuchs and Gebert, 1958; Garrels and Christ, 1959), and possibly some uraninite, 
which is a uranium oxide UO2. These uranium minerals are intimately mixed with fragments of 
carbonaceous material concentrated in thin layers or as disseminated particles. Pyrite is present 
locally. At the Busfield mine, the upper part of the sandstone lens has been oxidized and now 
contains some pods, disseminations, and joint coatings of carnotite, metatyuyamunite, and 
perhaps a mixture of meta-autunite [Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·2-6(H2O)] and hydrogen-autunite [also 
known as chernikovite (H3O)2(UO2)2(PO4)2·6(H2O)]. No oxidized uranium minerals were 
observed at the Vickers mine. 

Uranium content of the mineralized areas ranges from considerably less than ore grade (ore 
grade as referred to here is a minimum of 0.10 percent U) to 1.63 percent U at the Busfield mine 
and from less than ore grade to 0.84 percent U at the Vickers mine. Small samples selected for 
maximum uranium content have run as high as several percent uranium. The V2O5 content of 
samples collected ranges from less than 0.05 percent to 1.63 percent at the Busfield deposit and 
from less than 0.05 percent to 0.54 percent at the Vickers deposit. Small areas of anomalous

radioactivity have been found in holes drilled between the main deposits, but they are of small 
extent and probably of no commercial value. A significant part of the selenium probably is 
contained in the pyrite. A general increase in arsenic accompanies an increase in uranium 
content.  

  

7.2 Busfield Mine Uranium Mineralization 
The factors believed to be chiefly responsible for the localization of uranium ore at the Busfield 
mine are: (1) channel-like structure in the upper Fall River sandstone, (2) an underlying deposit 
of impermeable shale and siltstone, and (3) pinching out or rapid thinning of the ore-bearing 
sandstone at points where there is also a marked change in dip, (4) and, likely partial re-
mobilization of a pre-existing roll-front deposit. Similar features, which have been recognized in 
other areas of uranium mineralization, seem to be of major importance at the Busfield deposit.  A 
generalized section of the Busfield deposit is shown on Figure 7-1. 

 

7.2.1 Busfield Mine Workings 
The Busfield open pit was approximately 175 by 250 feet in the stripping area at the bottom. The 
pit was opened in such a way as to expose the widest, thickest, and highest-grade part of a 
lenslike ore body that lay at the bottom of the sandstone lens in the upper unit of the Fall River 
formation. The ore body, as delimited by company drilling, was a very irregularly shaped 
deposit, the longest dimension of which extended from about the center of the west side line of 
the Busfield 5 claim east-southeast about 700 feet and roughly corresponded to the axis of the 
thickest part of the sandstone lens. The west half of the body was the widest, attaining a 
maximum width of about 200 feet. In the vicinity of the easternmost corner of the pit, it 
narrowed abruptly to an average of about 50 feet. The bottom of the ore zone corresponded 
essentially to the bottom of the sandstone lens, which was a gently rolling irregular surface. The 
sandstone is directly underlain by a dense shaly siltstone. The top of the ore zone, which 
generally corresponded to the bottom of the zone of oxidation in the sandstone, was much more 
irregular. The thickness of the mined-out part of the ore zone ranged from 2 to 10 feet and 
averaged between 4 and 5 feet. The ore zone thinned as it narrowed in an easterly direction. 

 

7.2.2 Busfield Host Rock 
The host sandstone at the Busfield mine was predominantly thick-bedded to massive, cross 
stratified, fine grained to very fine grained, somewhat micaceous, and ranged from slightly 
carbonaceous to very carbonaceous. The sandstone, which totaled about 43 feet thick in the pit, 
was divided into two zones: an oxidized zone about 37 to 38 feet thick and an underlying 



Northern Canadian Minerals, Inc.  7-5 
Elkhorn Project  Elkhorn Uranium Exploration Project, Wyoming 
 

SRK Consulting (US), Inc.  April 2007 
Elkhorn NI 43-101_Final_18Apr07.doc   

unoxidized zone commonly 5 to 6 feet thick. The unoxidized zone was preserved by a local body 
of groundwater, perched on the dense shaly clayey siltstone underlying the sandstone. The ore 
body, defined here as that part of the deposit that was mined, mixed, and shipped, was almost 
entirely within the unoxidized zone. 

The oxidized zone was characterized by its light-brown to medium brown color, lenses and pods 
of dark-brown iron oxide-stained sandstone and siltstone and, locally, by yellow to yellow-green 
oxidized uranium minerals. The unoxidized zone was medium gray to very dark gray or black, 
depending upon the amount of carbonaceous material present, and contained considerable pyrite 
locally and no oxidized uranium minerals. The contact between the unoxidized zone and the 
underlying shale locally was marked by pyrite nodules as much as 4 or 5 inches in diameter. 
Between the distinct oxidized and unoxidized zones was a thin transition zone, commonly about 
6 inches thick, in which the gray sandstone became progressively more brownish upward and 
which locally contained a mixture of unoxidized and oxidized uranium minerals. This was the 
zone through which the top of the perched body of groundwater fluctuated.  

Carbonaceous material occurred both as disseminated particles and as concentrations in 
branching and coalescing layers, as much as one-foot thick, that were arranged predominantly 
along planes of cross-stratification. In general, the amount of carbonaceous debris in the entire 
sandstone interval increased downward; the coalified wood fragments became larger (up to half 
an inch or more in length) and more abundant, and the frequency of carbonaceous layers 
increased. Pyrite also became progressively more abundant downward through the unoxidized 
zone. 

The host rock in the oxidized zone was a very fine-grained, well-sorted quartzose sandstone 
containing a few percent of plagioclase and white mica. Clayey siltstone seams and micaceous 
laminae were not uncommon, and carbonaceous material was abundant locally. The sand grains 
were bonded or loosely cemented by clay minerals and by brown iron oxides. Uranium minerals 
occurred in carbonaceous layers, as small isolated pods or disseminations, and as thin films on 
joint surfaces. Within each concentration, the minerals occurred largely as coatings on sand 
grains or as cement and as fine aggregates or crystalline fragments between sand grains. 
Oxidized uranium minerals in samples from the Busfield deposit were identified as carnotite 
[K2(UO2)2V2O8·3(H2O)] and possibly a mixture of meta-autunite and hydrogen-autunite. 
According to MacPherson (1956), carnotite and metatyuyamunite [Ca(UO2)2V2O8·3(H2O)] have 
been recognized. Because the occurrences of oxidized minerals are sporadic, the oxidized part of 
the deposit was not mined.  

The sandstone in the unoxidized zone, which was the ore zone, was very fine grained, fairly well 
sorted, and was composed of angular quartz grains and minor amounts of plagioclase and mica. 
Clay minerals, pyrite, and carbonaceous material filled the interstices. Many quartz grains had

irregular grain boundaries, which may indicate that they have been corroded by mineralizing 
solutions. Black uranium minerals occurred in thin black lavers or seams. Commonly, though 
apparently not in all instances, the layers were carbonaceous, and not uncommonly they were 
associated with pyrite. 

 

7.2.3 Busfield Uranium Minerals 
No discrete uranium minerals were seen under the microscope. Coffinite and uraninite, which 
were identified by X-ray diffraction methods, apparently occurred in thin black layers or in 
disseminated fragments of carbonaceous material, some of which had been largely replaced by 
very finely granular pyrite. Some fragments of carbonaceous debris showed a cellular structure 
accentuated by fine-grained pyrite outlining tiny thin slivers of black opaque material that may 
have been an extremely fine-grained intimate mixture of organic material and uranium minerals. 
Coffinite and uraninite probably occurred also as intimate mixtures with the finely granular 
pyrite. 

 

7.2.4 Busfield Uranium Grades 
The grade of mineralized rock as determined from chemical analyses ranges from 0.003 percent 
to 1.63 percent uranium, and from less than 0.05 percent to 1.63 percent V2O5. The average 
vanadium-uranium ratio in seven samples was 1:4.4. There is a general parallel between oxidized 
minerals and a higher vanadium-uranium ratio.  

Selenium content ranged from 0.5 to 15 parts per million or from 0.00005 to 0.0015 percent and 
had no apparent relation to uranium content. Arsenic content ranged from less than 5 to 315 parts 
per million, or from less than 0.0005 to 0.0315 percent, and had a systematic correlation to 
uranium content and the oxidation state of its environment.

8 Exploration (Item 12) 
Description of historical exploration is sketchy beyond the description in the literature of the 
mining activities in the 1950s. Subsequent exploration in the 1960s and 1970s is described in 
Section 5 – History. Drilling was typically by standard rotary drilling methods, with holes logged 
by down-hole total count scintillation counters or radiometric probes. Typically analog printouts 
of down-hole logs, gamma logs, were made by contract logging companies and that output data 
was then used for determinations of uranium content; equivalent uranium assays (eU3O8). Partial 
information is available for the Elkhorn area, mostly as down-hole gamma logs from the 
exploration efforts of Federal Resources, copies of which are in the possession of NCA Nuclear. 
That drill log information and some historical regional maps of drill collar locations provide a 
basis for further exploration of the Fall River Formation in the area. 

NCA Nuclear's exploration first efforts were to confirm the mineralization at the Busfield 
extension with 10 percussion rotary drill holes that were gamma logged. That program was 
initiated in October, 2006. NCA Nuclear followed that drill program in November and December 
2006 with a program of 57 rotary drill holes and 13 core holes to define the mineralization; these 
70 drillholes totaled 8,319 feet of drilling (Figure 8-1). That drilling program was conducted at 
the Busfield historical mine area at the location of previously defined mineralization (Busfield 
southeast extension). Exploration was by industry standard drilling methods, with quality 
assurance/quality control (QA/QC) samples submitted along with core samples, and gamma 
logging by Colog of Golden, Colorado, an industry service company for down-hole logging. The 
drilling was conducted in a sufficient manner and detail to allow resource estimation by industry 
standard procedures. Exploration conducted by NCA Nuclear is the sole basis for resource 
estimation as defined in Section 15 of this report, and is adequate to define the mineralization.

9 Drilling (Item 13) 
NCA drilling is the basis for the current resource estimate stated in Section 15 of this report. 
None of the historically reported drill hole intercepts were used as it lacked drill hole logs, 
gamma logs, and generally could not be verified. 

 

9.1 Drilling by NCA 
The primary goal of the exploration drilling program was to collect subsurface samples and 
provide an open borehole to allow a gamma/resistivity log to be produced. NCA's drilling 
program was on nominally 50-foot spacing east-west lines and 100-foot line spacing (Figure 
8-1). In addition, NCA Nuclear drilled 13 core holes scattered across the drill pattern. NCA's 
drilling was by industry standard rotary drilling techniques using Western Land Drilling Services 
LLC of Sheridan, Wyoming, for the initial drilling program, and Materi Operations of Upton, 
Wyoming, for the follow-up rotary drilling. Core drilling was accomplished by Interstate Drilling 
Services, LLP, of Thompson, North Dakota. All drilling was vertical, to depths of approximately 
100 feet, which was appropriate to define the sub-horizontal mineralization. Rotary drilling 
followed by gamma logging is industry standard procedure for defining uranium mineralization. 
RC drilling and/or core drilling are used to collect samples of the mineralization for chemical 
analysis of uranium mineralization.   

Gamma/resistivity logging was conducted as soon as practical after completion of each borehole 
using a contract gamma logging service, Colog, based in Golden, Colorado.  

 

9.2 Historical Drilling by Others 
Historical drilling methods are not documented, but were typically rotary drilling with gamma 
logging to determine eU3O8 grades. That information has been used as a guide to NCA Nuclear's 
program, but the data is incomplete and was therefore not used in resource estimation. There are 
over 190 historical drill holes for which there is partial information, with approximately half 
those holes in the Busfield deposit, and the remainder as scattered, widely spaced, exploration 
holes throughout the land package and the Area of Interest. 

 

9.3 Recommendations 
Core drilling provided some information on disequilibrium (ratio of chemical U3O8 to 
radiometric U3O8), which shows a scatter of data. Additional RC or core samples are required to

sufficient number of samples for chemical U3O8 determinations. Drilling should be across the 
entire deposit dimensions to determine equilibrium/disequilibrium throughout the deposit. 

Additionally, drilling on the periphery of the deposit will better define the edge of 
mineralization. That drilling can be rotary drilling with down-hole gamma logging. 

Exploration drilling in the immediate vicinity of the Busfield resource, in and near other 
historical resources and occurrences, is also recommended. Such drilling would be directed at 
defining the potential for satellite uranium deposits that could augment the resources at Busfield.

10 Sampling Method & Approach 
Drilling methods for uranium mineralization are intended to primarily provide a drill hole for 
gamma logging determinations of eU3O8. Colog gamma logs are presented as both analog 
printouts and digital data output of radiometric counts per second (CPS), converted to ppm 
eU3O8, based on the gamma probe's calibration constant. Probe data provides for CPS and ppm 
eU3O8 data every 0.1 ft down-hole. That data is of sufficient density to allow for compositing of 
data to intervals appropriate for the mineralization. Sampling of initial percussion/rotary drilling 
was done for chemical confirmation of eU3O8 data, knowing the samples collected were not 
valid for accurate chemical determination of U3O8 as a check on disequilibrium as rotary samples 
are potentially contaminated by passing other mineralization in an open drill hole. 

NCA's approach to collect samples for confirmation and disequilibrium purposes was to use a 
core drill to collect HQ core across the deposit. Core recovery was poor for some of  the drilling. 
Therefore, only those holes with +85% recovery were used for sample collection. Core for those 
intervals was cut and sent to ALS Chemex in Reno, Nevada, for chemical eU3O8 determinations. 

Gamma logging procedures to determine eU3O8 down-hole, and chemical eU3O8 determinations 
for confirmation are industry standard procedures and adequate to define the uranium 
mineralization at Elkhorn.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses & Security (Item 
15) 

11.1 Sample Preparation and Assaying 
Sample preparation relates to core samples at Elkhorn. Percussion drill samples have not been 
used for analyses in resource estimation at this point in time. Digital gamma log data are 
converted to equivalent assays and therefore the process is described in this section as an 
analytical procedure.  

Core samples sent to ALS Chemex were prepared for XRF analysis by means of standard 
procedures to prepare a pulp of the submitted rock sample and to create a fused bead "puck" or 
disk of sample material that is used in the analytical process. 

 

11.2 Analytical Procedures 
Industry-standard analyses for chemical uranium (expressed as either ppm or percentage U or 
U3O8) are typically done by two methods: induction coupled plasma-mass spectrography (ICP-
MS), and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF). In XRF, a beam of electrons strikes a target 
element causing the target to release a primary source of X-rays. These primary X-rays are then 
used to irradiate a secondary target (the sample), causing the sample to produce fluorescent 
(secondary) X-rays. These fluorescent secondary X-rays are emitted with characteristic energies 
that can be used to identify the element from which they arise. The number of X-rays measured 
at each characteristic energy can therefore be used to measure the concentration of the element 
from which it arises. Samples of unknown concentration are compared with well-known 
international standard reference materials in order to define precise concentration levels of the 
unknown sample. XRF analyses for uranium comprise the primary method of the analyses 
performed on RC samples from the Elkhorn project 

 

11.3 Quality Controls & Quality Assurance 
NCA Nuclear instituted a program of QA/QC by submitting standard samples to ALS Chemex 
along with core samples from Elkhorn. Twenty-nine core intervals were selected for analysis of 
their uranium content by ALS Chemex in Reno, Nevada. Three blank samples consisting of 
industrial grade silica sand, and three uranium standard samples were submitted with the core 
splits. The core samples and the blanks were analyzed by ALS Chemex. The uranium standard 
samples, however, were lost during sample preparation and were not analyzed.  

When the absence of the standard samples was recognized, pulps of the original core and blank 
samples were re-submitted to ALS Chemex along with uranium standard samples from the same

batch as those submitted the first time. A comparison of the original analytical results with those 
of the re-submitted samples shows very similar uranium values (Table 11-1).

SRK considers the NCA QA/QC procedures as minimal, but adequate for the initial resource 
estimation. SRK recommends that future work utilize sample standards, and a rigorous protocol 
for review and acceptance/rejection/re-analysis of sample analytical results. 

 

11.3.1 Sample Security 
All drill core was collected by NCA Nuclear staff as the drilling was completed, and was 
maintained in their possession until samples were provided to the ALS Chemex lab in Reno, 
Nevada. Drill logs and digital drill log files were sent by Colog directly to NCA Nuclear. Drill 
hole logging was completed under the supervision of NCA Nuclear.  

 

11.4 ISO 9000 Certification 
ALS Chemex holds ISO 9002:1994 and ISO 9001:2000 certifications. ISO 9002 is a quality 
assurance model made up of quality system requirements. This model applies to organizations 
that produce, install, and service products. ISO expects organizations to apply this model, and to 
meet these requirements, by developing a quality system.  

Overall, NCA Nuclear's utilized sample preparation procedures, QA/QC, and sample security 
measures are adequate to provide confidence in the analytical data. 

 

11.5 Radiometric Analysis 
The basic analysis that supports the resource estimate for the Busfield Deposit at the Elkhorn 
project is the down-hole gamma log derived from the down-hole radiometric probe. That data is 
gathered as digital data on 1.0 cm intervals as the radiometric probe is extracted from a drill hole, 
reading from the bottom of the hole upwards. 

The down-hole radiometric probe measures total gamma radiation from all natural sources, 
including uranium-bearing minerals plus potassium (K) and thorium (Th). In most uranium 
deposits, K and Th often provide a minimal component to the total radioactivity, measured by 
the instrument as counts per second (CPS). For the general level of uranium mineralization at 
Elkhorn (500 ppm or greater), the portion of the total CPS that is likely due to K or Th is 
expected to be less than 3% and is thus not considered relevant to eU3O8 determinations. Thus, 
determined equivalent uranium analyses are typically expressed as parts per million (ppm) eU3O8 
("e" for equivalent) and should not be confused with U3O8 determination by standard XRF or 
ICP analytical procedures. Radiometric probing (gamma logs) and the conversion to eU3O8 data 
have been industry-standard practices used for in situ uranium determinations since the 1960s, 
and is acceptable for the Elkhorn Project. The conversion process can involve data corrections

for water in the hole and when gamma readings are taken through drill casing, neither of which 
are relevant to the recent drilling by NCA Nuclear at Elkhorn, as the holes were not wet in the 
zone of mineralization and no casing was used.  

SRK recommends that further gamma logging utilize a simple method of QA/QC whereby a drill 
hole is selected as a "standard" hole to be re-logged each day to establish "replicate" gamma 
logs. This will be a means of checking for instrument error or drift on a daily basis during 
subsequent drilling programs.

12 Data Verification (Item 16) 
Data verification was accomplished by several means: 

• Mineralization, geology, and historical drill holes were field verified; 
• Analytical results were compared to radiometric results; 
• NCA Nuclear's drill hole database was verified against the digital drill data provided by 

Colog and collar survey data provided by Kadrmas, Lee and Jackson; and 
• The current resource estimate compares reasonably well with historical resources. 

The author visited the historical Busfield open pit and the site of NCA's drilling adjacent to the 
open pit with a scintillometer. Anomalous radiometric readings (relative CPS) for the handheld 
Mt Sopris instrument verified mineralization in the pit walls as described in the historical 
literature. The anomalous gamma readings were noted to be in conjunction with carbonaceous 
trash along bedding planes on micro-bedding within the sandstone of the Fall River Formation. 
Locally, oxidized uranium minerals (yellow crystals similar to carnotite) were noted in 
association with anomalous radioactivity. While the historical drill holes are not being used in 
the current resource estimate, numerous (unidentifiable) historical drill holes are located to the 
southeast of the historical open pit, where the Busfield Extension mineralization is reported, and 
where NCA drilling defined a similar resource. In addition, the author personally viewed the 
contract logging that was in process by Colog. 

Analytical results of four samples collected by the author confirm uranium mineralization from 
271 to 5080 ppm U ppm. The ALS Chemex analytical data for core hole samples from NCA 
Nuclear's drilling confirm the radiometric determinations. While there is significant variance in 
the comparison of radiometric to chemical uranium assays, which indicates that some sample 
intervals may be out of equilibrium, confirmation of uranium mineralization has been 
established. 

SRK confirmed the NCA Nuclear digital database by comparing the digital gamma log data 
provided by Colog to the digital Excel spread sheets provided by NCA Nuclear. This was 
accomplished by choosing an interval value near the top, middle, and bottom of each drill hole 
gamma log and comparing it to the same interval in the Excel data sheet. Since the data was all 
transferred directly from the original source to the resultant database, the values were necessarily 
all good or all bad. Therefore, three values from each of the 70 drill holes were cross compared 
for a total of 210 verifications. No errors were found and the NCA Nuclear database was deemed 
to be of high quality. In addition, 70% of the drillhole collar locations in the Excel spread sheet 
were verified to the original survey coordinates and all were found to be correct. 

Current resources stated in Section 15 of this report compare favorably with historical estimates, 
even though the historical method of estimation were likely polygonal and therefore differ in

estimation method from currently used techniques. As the recent drilling covers approximately 
the same general area as the historical drilling, this is another form of verification. 

In the author's opinion, the data supporting a resource estimate for the Busfield Extension at 
Elkhorn, as presented in Section 15 of this report, is data that can be verified in the field, and can 
be replicated by chemical assays and gamma log determined eU3O8.

13 Adjacent Properties (Item 17) 
The Vickers historical uranium mine, as described in Section 4.2.2 of this report is located 
approximately 0.5 miles to the northwest of the historical Busfield mine and the current resource 
estimate for the Busfield Extension deposit. The Vickers historical mine is on property 
contiguous to the Busfield Extension deposit, and is located on lands held by NCA Nuclear. 
There are several other known occurrences of uranium mineralization and historical drill holes 
containing reported uranium mineralization on the greater Elkhorn Property. All of this 
information supports the exploration potential for the Elkhorn Project, which will be the focus of 
NCA's continued exploration efforts.

As the Elkhorn Project is an exploration project, no mineral processing tests or metallurgical 
tests have been conducted on mineralization from the Elkhorn project area.

15 Mineral Resources & Reserves (Item 19) 
15.1 Basic Information 
Data used by SRK for resource estimation on the Busfield deposit, Elkhorn Project, were all new 
drilling data acquired by NCA Nuclear. No historical drill hole data were used. 

In situ grade of uranium deposits is typically determined, not by chemical uranium analyses, but 
by radiometrically determined equivalent analyses from down-hole gamma logging. Radiometric 
readings as counts per second (CPS) are readings of total gamma radiation from all sources. 
Most natural gamma radiation is from potassium (K), uranium (U) and thorium (Th) sources; 
cosmic radiation is minimal and relatively insignificant. Normally, in the case of sandstone-
hosted uranium deposits, background CPS is related to K from rock-forming feldspars, which 
does not constitute a sufficient percentage of the total CPS to be removed from the database. At 
the Busfield Extension deposit on the Elkhorn Project, the radiometric background is equivalent 
to approximately 15 to 20 ppm eU3O8, which is 3% to 4% of the lower end of mineralization 
grades of potential interest (+500 ppm), and is therefore deemed not relevant to the 
mineralization of interest. Therefore, no eU3O8 database corrections were  made for background. 

Disequilibrium in uranium deposits relates to uranium dissolution and chemical re-deposition by 
groundwater prior to the time required for the radiometric uranium-decay daughter products to 
equilibrate with the chemical uranium. Correcting for disequilibrium in the database is not 
necessarily a straightforward process, and depends upon the data distributions of both the XRF 
(chemical U) and the eU3O8 (radiometric U) data sets. Disequilibrium was examined for the 
Busfield Extension deposit, based on the probe data and the XRF analytical data from the core 
drilling program (ratio of chemical U3O8 to radiometric eU3O8; or cU3O8/ eU3O8). A plot of the 
relative disequilibrium is shown in Figure 15-1 below. The expectation is, for deposits in 
equilibrium, there will be a scatter of data about the 1:1 Line shown on the plot. The scatter is 
due to chemical or XRF U analyses being done on the core that has come from the drillhole, 
while the gamma log determined eU represents the material outside the drill hole. From the 
limited data available for Elkhorn, two conclusions can be made: 

• The scatter is large in the ratio of XRF U to eU, and so additional sample pairs are 
needed. 

• The limited data suggests there is a negative disequilibrium for many of the samples. The 
ratio of XRF U to eU is less than 1.0, indicating leaching of some of the chemical 
uranium relative to the gamma determined uranium.  

As core recovery was poor for some drill holes, and while NCA geologists collected core 
samples from the zones with better recovery, sampling bias can be a factor in data scatter. 
Recommendations going forward are to drill more core holes, and collect additional samples for

XRF analyses. To potentially minimize sample variance, it is recommended that larger interval 
samples (5.0 ft or better) be collected to compare with eU determination from gamma logs.

15.2 Resource Estimation 
 

15.2.1 Drill hole Sample Database 
The drill hole database was compiled by NCA Nuclear and verified by SRK personnel and is 
determined to be of high quality. The database consists of four Microsoft Excel spreadsheets 
containing collar locations, drill hole orientations, geologic intervals with formation rock codes, 
and assay intervals with results. The assay intervals are reported in 0.1 ft increments. The 
database was verified prior to starting the modeling procedure. Verification involved comparing 
the original down hole gamma logs to the Excel spreadsheets for three intervals from each drill 
hole. Because the data was transferred electronically from the original logs to the spreadsheets 
one hole at a time, the data would necessarily be all bad or all good for each drill hole. No errors 
were found in the data base. The gamma logs were reported in values of ppm eU-238 rather than 
the industry standard of eU3O8. To accommodate this, the eU-238 (ppm U stated as ppm for the U-
238 decay isotope) values were factored up by a multiplier of 1.179 to create an eU3O8 value.

[Note: XRF analyses of chemical uranium content can be reported as either ppm U or ppm 
eU3O8]. The appropriate codes for missing samples and no recovery were used during the 
modeling procedures.  

The resource database contains information from 70 drillholes totaling 8,319 feet of drilling. The 
maximum drill hole depth is 350 feet and the average is 120 feet. All of the holes were drilled 
vertically and none were surveyed for down hole deviation. Due to the vertical orientation and 
relatively shallow depth, the lack of down hole deviation surveys is not considered significant. 

 

15.2.2 Geology 
The Elkhorn uranium mineralization is hosted within sandstone and siltstone units of the 
Cretaceous age Fall River Sandstone. This unit grades downward into the Lower Fall River 
Shale and is overlain by the Skull Creek Shale. Both of these units appear to have acted as 
impermeable barriers that limited the movement of the uranium-bearing fluids to within the more 
permeable sand and silt units. The stratigraphy described above is presently situated in a nearly 
horizontal orientation.  

 

15.2.3 Compositing 
The raw eU3O8 assay data was first plotted on histogram and cumulative frequency graphs to 
understand the basic statistical distribution of the data. The histogram plots of the raw data show 
a strong positive skewness and the cumulative frequency plot illustrates a continuous population 
set with no major changes in slope. The cumulative frequency plots show several outlier data 
values at the upper end of the grade distribution. Review of the data set filtered to include only 
values greater than 1,000 ppm shows an inflection of the distribution curve and accelerated 
increase in eU3O8 values above the 3,000 ppm level. Based on the outlier nature the eU3O8, 
composite values were capped at 3,000 ppm to prevent unwanted high-grade influence. The 
composites were first created with the uncapped data and the resulting composite files were 
subsequently capped. Within the five feet bench composite file, this resulted in four composites 
ranging from 3,443 ppm to 5,249 ppm being reduced to 3,000 ppm eU3O8.  

The raw drill hole data was composited on 5-foot and 2.5-ft intervals starting at the 3,825 bench 
elevation and continuing to the bottom of the hole. The 5-ft and 2.5-ft composite data was plotted 
on histogram and cumulative frequency graphs for comparison to the raw and block model data. 
The histogram and cumulative probability plots described above are presented in Appendix B 
and summarized in Table 15-1.

15.2.4 Specific Gravity 
Specific gravity determinations were derived from representative samples of each rock type 
collected during NCA's 2006 core drilling program. Although NCA drilled and in some cases re-
drilled a total of 13 locations, core recovery was so poor within the mineralized zones that only 
three holes produced a large enough quantity of sample to be used for both equilibrium and 
specific gravity determinations. ALS Chemex in Vancouver, B.C., Canada conducted all the 
specific gravity analyses.  

The drill hole lithologic interpretations provided by NCA were used to create 3-D bodies of each 
rock type. These bodies were assigned unique specific gravities based on the results of the ALS 
Chemex tests. Table 15-2 lists the specific gravity results for each sample of the different rock 
types. Although the sampling is heavily biased towards the sandstone unit, the bulk of the 
mineralization also occurs within this unit. The specific gravity data is therefore judged to be 
representative of the deposit in general at this level of investigation.

15.2.5 Variogram Analysis & Modeling 
 

15.2.5.1 Variogram Analysis 

Semi-variogram analysis was conducted on the 5-ft drill hole composite data to determine 
appropriate projection ranges and to test for any preferred orientation of the mineralization. 
Semi-variograms were constructed using Vulcan software in 36 directions and in 10° 
inclinations. The final analysis showed preferred orientations congruent with the three 
dimensional shape of the mineralization. The longest range was oriented at azimuth 125° dipping 
0°,  correlating to the longest axis of the deposit. The intermediate range is oriented at azimuth 
350 dipping 0°, correlating to the intermediate axis of the mineralization. The final range, oriented 
orthogonal to the previous two is vertical, correlating to the general thickness of the 
mineralization. The Semi-variograms for each of these orientations are presented in Appendix C. 
Ranges, nugget values and total sill values are presented below in Table 15-3.

15.2.5.2 Modeling 

The Elkhorn deposit was modeled only for eU3O8 content. While vanadium is known to be 
present in the deposit, insufficient information is available to determine interval grades; 
therefore, vanadium resources, if present, cannot be estimated. The final block size used was 15-
ft by 15-ft by 15-ft; all block estimates were made using only 5-ft drill hole composites. The 
model boundaries based on State Plane grid coordinates are presented in Table 15-4.

A grade shells was only used to control the projection limits of the resource estimate around the 
perimeter of unconfined drill holes. For this purpose, a confining shape was generated 75-feet 
outward from the drill holes, and this boundary was used to limit the projection of 
mineralization. The grade estimate was conducted such that a minimum of 3 and maximum of 9 
composites from at least two drill holes were required to assign grade to a block. The minimum 
of three composites was necessary so that a 15-ft block would be using at least three 5-ft vertical 
composites to assign grade. A maximum of nine composites was chosen to try to pull data from 
three different drill holes where possible. As described above, the search ellipsoid was oriented 
horizontally with major and intermediate axes of 125 ft and a minor axis of 10 ft oriented 
vertically. The 10 ft vertical search distance was required to minimize grade smearing across 
horizontal mineralization zones. The distance to the nearest composite was stored for later use in 
resource classification. A typical block model cross section of eU3O8 derived from inverse 
distance weighting squared is shown in Figure 15-2. For comparison, the 5-ft assay composites 
of eU3O8 are included on this same section.

15.2.5.3 Model Verification 

The Elkhorn model was run using three different sets of estimation parameters, including Inverse 
Distance Weighting Squared, Polygonal (ID4), and ordinary Kriging. In addition, the composite 
length was varied between a 5-ft and 2.5-ft length, and the model was run using capped and 
uncapped data to evaluate the effects on the model results.  

The resulting block grades were compared to the raw assay values and composite assay values to 
review the histogram distribution and average grade of each. Table 15-5 lists the statistical 
comparisons of each. The various models display minor variations in tons and grade but the 
estimated metal content varies little. The distribution of block grades were evaluated visually for 
each of the models to judge the relevance of the block grades in comparison to the composite 
grades. The modeling results from the different estimation parameters are presented in Table 
15-6 below. 

Appendix D contains  representative cross section and bench plans showing the distribution of 
eU3O8 across the entire deposit. Histogram and cumulative frequency plots of  block model 
results from the different modeling verifications are presented in Appendix E.

15.2.6 Resource Classification 
The Mineral Resources are classified under the categories of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred 
Mineral resources according to CIM guidelines. Classification of the resources reflects the 
relative confidence of the grade estimates, primarily as a function of sample spacing relative to 
geological and geostatistical observations regarding the continuity of mineralization. 

In this study, the blocks were assigned to Indicated or Inferred based on the distance to the 
closest composite. The blocks were all estimated by at least two drillholes. Where the distance to 
the closest composites was within 75 ft or less, the resources were classified as Indicated. The 
confidence of the projection distance used to determine Indicated resource was determined 
primarily from the drill hole variograms and reflects a distance of approximately two thirds the 
average range. The blocks located greater than 75 ft from the nearest composite were classified 
as Inferred.  

 

15.2.7 Mineral Resource Statement 
Based on visual comparison of block grade distribution relative to drillhole composites and 
histogram comparison, the inverse distance weighting squared using a minimum of 3 and 
maximum of 9 composites was chosen as the most appropriate estimation method for Elkhorn. 
The tonnage and grade at appropriate eU3O8 cut-offs for indicated and inferred resources at are 
shown in Table 15-7.

16 Other Relevant Data & Information (Item 20) 
There is no other relevant information that affects the exploration for uranium on the Elkhorn 
Project or the uranium resource at the Busfield Extension deposit.

17 Interpretation & Conclusions (Item 21) 
The Elkhorn Project is a large land position and area of interest in northeastern Wyoming that 
underwent limited uranium production in the late 1950s and sporadic uranium exploration until 
the early 1970s. NCA Nuclear has secured a land position on favorable exploration ground 
surrounding the historical producing Vickers and Busfield Mines, and has drill defined an area 
know as the Busfield Extension deposit immediately adjacent to the former Busfield Mine. That 
drilling is sufficient to define a current NI 43-101 compliant resource of 250,000 tons Indicated 
resource grading 0.08% eU3O8 for 397,000 contained pounds eU3O8, and an additional 3,000 
tons Inferred resource grading 0.08% eU3O8 for 5,000 contained pounds eU3O8. Uranium 
mineralization occurs in the Fall River sandstone of lower Cretaceous age, and resembles typical 
sandstone-hosted "roll-front" uranium mineralization that exist elsewhere in Wyoming. There is 
considerable exploration potential on NCA-held ground in the immediate vicinity of the Busfield 
Extension deposit. 

 

17.1 Opportunity 
There is opportunity to perhaps incrementally increase the resource base at the Busfield 
Extension deposit, as the mineralization may not be fully drilled out, although current and 
historical information indicates that potential is not large.  

As the mineralization is considered to be perhaps the remnants of a once larger roll-front deposit, 
there is ample opportunity to explore down regional dip of the Fall River Formation to the 
northwest for roll-front mineralization. Historical drill information will help guide that effort. 

Other Busfield-like zones of uranium mineralization may be present and provide an exploration 
opportunity for similar shallow mineralization grading 0.05 to 0.15% eU3O8.  

 

17.2 Project Risks 
As indicated by the scatter of chemical data to radiometric eU3O8 data in the current drill hole 
database, and the historical reports of some disequilibrium in assays, there is the likelihood of 
some disequilibrium in the uranium mineralization of the Busfield Extension deposit. While 
there is no indication that all of the mineralization is out of equilibrium (positive or negative), 
there is a risk that a portion of the deposit is out of equilibrium and that might affect the total in 
situ resource pounds of uranium in the ground. This risk factor is best mitigated by securing 
more drill samples (RC or Core) for XRF analyses and comparison with the gamma log 
determined eU3O8 data.

17.2.1 Price Fluctuation 
Uranium prices are at all time highs in excess of $70.00 per pound of U3O8, which has spurred 
on the current uranium exploration/development boom. Commodity price forecasts are 
notoriously unreliable, and pose a risk to the project. 

 

17.2.2 Resource and Reserve Definition 
The current resource estimate for the Busfield Extension deposit can be improved by drilling on 
the periphery of the deposit to better define the edges of mineralization. 

Mineability and potential economic viability of mining the Busfield Extension deposit have not 
yet been addressed. 

 

17.2.3 Metallurgical Characteristics 
Mineralogy and metallurgical characteristics of the uranium mineralization at the Busfield 
Extension deposit are not known with certainly, and need definition and quantification. 
Mineralization was produced and sold from the Busfield open pit during the late 1950s, so 
metallurgy is not deemed a critical concern. 

 

17.2.4 Environmental Considerations 
Permitting an open pit uranium mine has not happened in the U.S. since the late 1970s, so 
acquiring the necessary permits and environmental clearances to advance the project is a project 
risk that is difficult to assess. Wyoming is a current uranium producing state, from ISL (In situ 
Leach) production in the Powder River Basin in the central part of the state; therefore, this risk is 
considered manageable.

18 Recommendations (Item 22) 
18.1 Summary 
SRK recommends a program of drilling to further define resource criteria for the Busfield 
mineralization. That program should be either RC or core drilling to provide sufficient samples 
for comparison with eU3O8 data across the deposit, for disequilibrium determinations.  

 

18.2 Exploration Drilling 
Exploration drilling in the immediate area and near the Vickers historical mine site has the 
potential to add pounds to the resource base for the immediate Busfield resource area. A limited 
program of exploration drilling in the immediate vicinity (within a mile radius) of the Busfield 
mineralization is recommended to assess the potential for developing satellite pods of uranium 
resource.  

A program of confirmation drilling for the purpose of collecting samples for analysis is 
recommended as either RC or core drilling. Given the difficulties with core drilling completed, 
RC drilling with face-discharge bits could be used for relatively contamination-free samples on 
5-foot intervals to compare with gamma log determinations of eU3O8. 

Additional drilling on the periphery of the Busfield Extension deposit will better define the edges 
of mineralization and is also recommended. A regional program of exploration within the NCA 
property holdings and within the areas of interest is also recommended to determine if other 
areas have exploration resource potential equal to or greater than the Busfield area.  

 

18.3 Other Geological and Metallurgical Work 
Mineralogical work on the type and mode of occurrence of uranium minerals is recommended in 
concert with preliminary metallurgical testing to determine the applicability of the Busfield 
mineralization to either conventional milling, in situ leaching, or heap-leaching. 

 

18.4 Proposed Budget 
A proposed estimated Phase I budget to accomplish the above is presented below: 
 
RC drilling and gamma logging – 20 holes for 100 feet  $30,000 
 Analyses – 400 @ $30 each (U and V)  $12,000 
 Gamma logging (contract)   $15,000 
Core Drilling and gamma logging – 10 holes for 100 feet  $25,000 
 Analyses – 200 samples @ $30 each  $  6,000

 Gamma logging (contract)   $  7,500 
Mineralogical examinations      $10,000 
Metallurgical testing (estimate)     $50,000 
Exploration Drilling and gamma logging – 15 holes for 150 feet $33,750 
 Gamma logging (contract)   $10,000 
 Total estimated cost Busfield area           $199,250 
 
Regional Property exploration 
 50 drill holes @ 250 feet each @ $15/ft            $187,500 
 Gamma logging               $  30,000 
 TOTAL Phase I Estimated Budget            $416,750 
 

A Phase II budget of approximately $1.0 million would be contingent upon success in the 
proposed Phase I budget. The Phase II budget would consist of a combination of follow-up in-fill 
drilling intended for resource definition, and perhaps a scoping study to define the project 
parameters beyond resource definition. The scoping study would include infrastructure, water, 
power, and mining and processing options and identification of development parameters 
necessary to quantify in order to move the project forward to a pre-feasibility study. 

The Phase I recommended program and budget of $416,750 can be accomplished in an estimated 
time frame of 6 to 9 months depending upon access, weather conditions, and permitting 
requirements. A Phase II program and budget could be accomplished in an additional estimated 9 
to 12 months.

The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified according to the "CIM 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines" (August 2000). 
Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the 
Reserves have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated 
Resources as defined below.  
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized 
organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.  
An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade 
or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and 
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on 
limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 
An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely 
enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 
A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of 
the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade 
continuity. 
Mineral Reserves 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral 
Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include

adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors 
that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral 
Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material 
is mined.  
A 'Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility 
Study. This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 
economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 
extraction can be justified.  
A 'Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource 
demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate 
information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.  

21.2 Glossary 
Assay: The chemical analysis of mineral samples to determine the metal 

content.  

Background Radiation That portion of the radiometric total count reading (CPS or counts per 
second) that are attributable to non-recoverable uranium, potassium 
and thorium radiation on gamma logs 

Carnotite A naturally occurring uranium and vanadium mineral with the formula 
K2(UO2)2(VO4)2·3H2O (hydrated potassium uranyl vanadate). 
Carnotite contains uranium and vanadium in the U:V ratio of 4.67:1.0 
by weight or 3.087:1.0 for U3O8: V2O5 ratio [for every 3.087 units of 
U3O8 recovered as carnotite, 1.0 unit of V2O5 will be recovered. Or 
conversely for every 1.0 part U3O8 recovered there will be 0.324 parts 
V2O5].  

Composite: Combining more than one sample result to give an average result over 
a larger distance.  

   

   

Cutoff Grade (CoG): The grade of mineralized rock, which determines as to whether or not 
it is economic to recover its metal content by further concentration. 
Typically resources are stated as cumulative tonnage and grade above 
a given cutoff grade; and stated at several different cutoff grades 

Dilution: Waste, which is unavoidably mined with ore.  

Dip: Angle of inclination of a geological feature/rock from the horizontal.  

Fault: The surface of a fracture along which movement has occurred.  

Footwall: The underlying side of an orebody or stope.

Gangue: Non-valuable components of the ore.  

Grade: The measure of concentration of gold within mineralized rock.  

Hangingwall: The overlying side of an orebody or slope.    

Igneous: Primary crystalline rock formed by the solidification of magma.  

Kriging: An interpolation method of assigning values from samples to blocks 
that minimizes the estimation error.    

Lithological: Geological description pertaining to different rock types.    

Milling: A general term used to describe the process in which the ore is crushed 
and ground and subjected to physical or chemical treatment to extract 
the valuable metals to a concentrate or finished product.  

Mineral/Mining Lease: A lease area for which mineral rights are held.      

Radiation Or radioactivity; meaning the emissions of alpha, beta, and gamma 
rays from naturally occurring minerals and rocks. 

Sedimentary: Pertaining to rocks formed by the accumulation of sediments, formed 
by the erosion of other rocks.  

Scintillometer  A hand-held instrument or down-hole probe that detects radiation as 
counts per second (CPS)   

Spectrometer An instrument that measures CPS radioactivity and differentiates the 
total CPS spectral radiation emissions into that derived from potassium 
(K), uranium (U), and thorium (Th), the most commonly occurring 
radioactive elements found in rocks and minerals. 

Stratigraphy: The study of stratified rocks in terms of time and space.  

Strike: Direction of line formed by the intersection of strata surfaces with the 
horizontal plane, always perpendicular to the dip direction.  

Sulfide: A sulfur bearing mineral.  

Total Count Total CPS from all radioactive sources, U, K, and Th. Total Count and 
CPS are commonly used synonymously. 

Variogram: A statistical representation of the characteristics (usually grade).
