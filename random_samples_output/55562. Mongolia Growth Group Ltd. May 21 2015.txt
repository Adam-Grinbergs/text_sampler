2014 started with much hope and promise, yet ended 
with accelerating operating losses and extensive 
disruption to our overall business. Ultimately, we had 
to bear a substantial economic cost to reverse these 
trends and set the company back on a viable course. 

On the upside, our acquisition of the Tuguldur Center 
and adjacent land packages were the culmination of 
over a year of negotiations that created the cornerstone 
of our future growth. Redevelopment of Tuguldur Stage 
1 represented our largest project to date and when 
the development of Tuguldur Stage 2 is completed, 
this retailing center will reposition MGG as a dominant 
retail-focused property company. Unfortunately, our 
2014 successes get rather thin after our triumph with 
Tuguldur. 

As the company's largest shareholder, I have always 
promised that I would look out for minority shareholders 
and ensure that we run a frugal organization focused on 
long-term shareholder returns. As the year progressed, 
I realized that we were drastically straying from this 
ethos. In 2014 not only were the Company's losses 
accelerating, but years of accomplishments looked on 
the verge of being annulled. Ultimately, this realization 
amongst myself and other large shareholders 
precipitated the changes that were announced at year-
end. 

In 2015 our current board and I have undertaken the 
following actions;

• A dramatic cost cutting initiative targeted at 
aligning our cost structure with current revenues

• The re-initiation of various internal processes in 
order to improve efficiency and accountability

• A focus on restoring the company's relationships 
with employees and the Mongolian business 
community

• A repositioning of Tuguldur Center in order 
to improve its profile amongst shoppers and 
reduce tenant turnover

The net result of these actions is that our monthly cash 
burn has declined from the hundreds of thousands, 
into the tens of thousands. Over the past four months, 
much has been accomplished to preserve our core 
business, but we still have a long road ahead of us. 
Our goal is to achieve positive cash flow. This goal 
seemed impossible when I resumed the role of CEO in 
December; there is now a clear path to get there. As the 
business stabilizes we are once again thinking of how 
to grow our revenues. The initiatives that we will target 
were identified over a year ago—however, we are now 
setting our plans towards turning them into reality. 

In summary, 2014 was a very difficult and traumatic 
year for MGG. I believe that the Company is now on the 
best path that it has been on since inception. Recently, 
the government of Mongolia has taken steps to 
reinvigorate the overall Mongolian economy. I believe 
that we will once again be beneficiaries of this growth; 
however we will be operating with a much lower cost 
structure—hopefully giving us improved leverage to 
Mongolia. 

I want to thank the shareholders and employees of MGG 
for staying with us during 2014. We have stumbled, but 
not fallen—2015 will be better. 

Sincerely,

Harris Kupperman

Harris Kupperman
Chairman of the Board

MONGOLIA GROWTH GROUP LTD.
Management Discussion & Analysis
December 31, 2014
The management of Mongolia Growth Group Ltd. ( "MGG" or "the Corporation") presents the Corporation's 
management discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2014 (the "MD&A"), compared with the 
year ended December 31, 2013.  As of January 1, 2011, the Corporation adopted International Financial Reporting 
Standards ("IFRS"). This MD&A provides an overall discussion, followed by analyses of the performance of the 
Corporation's major reportable segments. The reporting and presentation currency in the consolidated financial 
statements and in this discussion and analysis is the Canadian dollar, unless otherwise noted. 

This MD&A is dated April 29, 2015, and incorporates all relevant information and considerations to that date.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial 
statements of the Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 together with all of 
the notes, risk factors and information contained therein, available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. 

Non-IFRS Financial Measures 
This MD&A makes reference to earnings before interest, taxes, unrealized fair value adjustments, depreciation and 
amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"). The Corporation uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of the performance of its 
operating subsidiaries as it excludes depreciation and interest charges, which are a function of the Corporation's 
specific capital structure, and also excludes entity specific tax expense. These amounts are not performance 
measures as defined under IFRS and should not be considered either in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net 
earnings prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Corporation refers to "Funds used in operations", "operating 
losses" and "re-valuation of investment properties" within this analysis.  "Funds used in operations" is computed by 
calculating the cash flow from operations before changes to non-cash working capital from operations.  "Operating 
Profits" is computed by calculating the profit before tax and any fair value adjustments.

statements can be identified by words such as "anticipate", "continue", "estimate", "expect", "forecast", "may", 
"will", "project", "should", "believe", or similar expressions.  

These statements represent management's best projections but undue reliance should not be placed upon them

Section 1 – Overview

Financial and Operational Overview
During 2014, the Corporation continued to suffer from negative cash flow as a result of excessive spending 
and insufficient revenues. Over the course of the year, these negative cash flows accelerated, which ultimately 
necessitated a management change at year end in order to correct this imbalance and put the Corporation on a 
more sustainable path. 

On the positive side, the Corporation saw increased revenues versus the prior year due to an overall increase in 
average revenue per meter. This was achieved by maintaining high occupancy rates during the year, even amidst a 
slowdown in the local economy and higher vacancy rates across the country.   The Corporation's occupancy rates 
continue to be strong with a weighted average occupancy rate of 94.2% at the end of the year.

On the expense side, overall expenses increased from $5,598,618 in 2013 to $7,543,135 in 2014, contributing to a 
negative cash flow of $3,724,898 during the year.  

The Corporation had an unrealized fair value adjustment gain at the end of the year of $10,683,896 versus a fair 
value adjustment gain of $3,845,521 during the prior year. 

This significant fair value adjustment propelled the Corporation to net income from Continuing Operations of 
$4,151,782 or a gain of $0.12 per share (EPS) versus a net loss of $250,574 or a net loss of $0.01 per share (EPS) in 
2013. 

Throughout the year, the Corporation continued to dispose of non-core assets to streamline the portfolio and 
dispose of smaller and underperforming assets.  Proceeds from sales were used for working capital and reinvested 
in higher quality institutional assets with better net-yield profiles. During the year, the Corporation disposed and 
swapped a total of 25 properties at a gain of $56,105.  As of December 31, 2014, the Corporation had 6 investment 
properties classified as available for sale. 

The Mongolian Tögrög continued to depreciate throughout the year, depreciating from 1,542 MNT/CAD on 
December 31, 2013, to 1,624 MNT/CAD over the course of 2014; a decline of 5.3%. 

In December 2014, the Corporation replaced four resigning members of the Board of Directors (Jordan Calonego, 
Bill Fleckenstein, John Shaw and Paul Sweeney) with four new Board members (Nick Cousyn, Jim Dwyer, Brad 
Farquhar and Robert Scott). Additionally, former CEO Paul Byrne resigned and the existing Board Chair, Harris 
Kupperman, reassumed the role of CEO, with a mandate to reduce costs and improve operational performance.

Economic Overview
During recent years, the Mongolian real estate sector has benefitted from significant local economic growth.  The 
majority of this recent growth is attributable to the mining and construction booms taking place in Mongolia, mainly 
resulting from the opening of the Oyu Tolgoi and Tavan Tolgoi deposits located in the Gobi desert. The associated 
infrastructure requirements for these projects have also served to strengthen the local economy. In addition, an 
increase in other industries, particularly tourism and agriculture have helped to grow the economy. The positive 
impact of improving consumer and business confidence has led to a substantial increase in the gross production of 
the local economy. 

During 2014, the Mongolian economy witnessed a decrease in its growth rate, with this slow-down accelerating 
in the second half of the year. This slow-down has been caused by reduced prices for commodities, political 
uncertainty, the arrest of certain foreign executives, a decrease in bank lending, along with significant doubt over 
the timing of the continuation of the Oyu Tolgoi underground development. These factors have led to a substantial 
decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) which has reduced the rate of growth of the economy.

The Mongolian economy continues to grow though at a slower rate according to data from The National Statistics 
Office of Mongolia ("NSO") with estimates of full year 2014 growth of 7.8% from 11.7% in 2013.   

The Mongolian Tögrög has fluctuated significantly over the past three years.  In 2013, the average exchange rate 
between the Tögrög and the Canadian Dollar was approximately 1,360 MNT/CAD for the year, whereas during 
2014, the Tögrög reached a low of over 1,728 Tögrög per Canadian Dollar and averaged 1,637 per Canadian 
Dollar.  Management would like to note that in general, most commercial property transactions in Ulaanbaatar are 



Mongolia Growth Group Ltd. |  7

negotiated in US Dollars and recent declines in the Tögrög to US Dollar exchange rate have not had a noticeable 
impact on the prices of property assets, in US Dollar terms. 

Management believes that the current economic slow-down is the result of policies that have discouraged Foreign 
Direct Investment ("FDI"). When the government takes the appropriate steps to stimulate FDI, it is expected that the 
economy can return to prior rates of economic growth. MGG remains a believer in the long-term growth potential of 
Mongolia.

Property Overview
The general property market continues to be influenced by the overall Mongolian economy. With the recent 
slow-down in the Mongolian economy, there has been a noticeable increase in vacancy, particularly in office and 
residential space. In the downtown core, this has led to a decline in pricing for both rental rates and sales for those 
two asset classes. High street retail has seen less of an increase in supply, and demand for space remains strong. 

Outside of the downtown of Ulaanbaatar, a noticeable increase in building activity has saturated certain markets 
and led to a more substantial decline in prices. In addition, there has been a recent increase in office and residential 
construction activity that will likely lead to future saturation in those markets. Management cautions shareholders 
that property prices have historically been, and continue to be, volatile. 

Management expects continued high demand for well-located retail space, with a lower demand level for office 
space. However, MGG continues to have below market rates of vacancy in all asset classes.

Section 2 - Executing the Strategy

Core Business 
During the past four years, Management and employees have worked hard to build up the infrastructure needed 
to manage MGG's institutional property platform. This platform is unique in Mongolia and is one of the only 
platforms capable of managing assets through the full cycle of ownership from acquisition and development, 
through disposition and includes dedicated departments that manage maintenance, leasing, marketing and tenant 
management. Management believes it has a strong team in place to lead the Corporation into its next phase of 
growth. 

MGG's real estate subsidiary plans on further expansion via the investment of additional capital into income 
producing and redevelopment properties in Ulaanbaatar. The Corporation's plan is contingent on procuring further 
funds for investment and on finding suitable investment targets which meet MGG's stringent investment criteria. In 
addition, due to MGG's unique platform, the Corporation is adding third party leasing and property management 
to its focus, in order to leverage its existing resources. Management believes that it has excess capacity to handle 
these functions. 

Since inception, MGG has acquired a number of redevelopment properties. To date the Corporation has also 
remodeled, rebuilt and completed additions on properties. During 2014, the Corporation spent substantial 
resources on redeveloping its Tuguldur retail center property. Assuming that funding is available, the Corporation 
intends to invest substantial additional capital into increasing the size of this property. It is Management's intent to 
begin de novo property developments on the Corporation's other owned sites and MGG's intention is to remain a 
substantial owner of the properties, post-completion. However, there can be no certainty on when this happens due 
to the current economic climate in Mongolia and the difficulty in accessing additional growth capital.

Portfolio
Mongolia Growth Group's properties are located in Downtown and the Central Business District of Ulaanbaatar.  
Within the financial statements, MGG classifies properties in each of the following categories; Investment 
Properties, Property and Equipment, and Other Assets/Prepaid Deposits.  

Investment Properties 
Investment Properties includes properties held to earn rental revenue, for capital appreciation, and/or for 
redevelopment. Investment Properties are initially valued at fair value, which is the purchase price plus any directly 
attributable expenditures. Investment Properties are subsequently valued at fair value, which reflects market 
conditions at the date of the statement of financial position.

The weighted average remaining lease term decreased slightly to 17.2 months at December 31st 2014, from 17.7 
months at December 31st 2013 calculated as a percentage of monthly revenues.

It is Management's belief that most existing leases are at rates that are generally at the current prevailing market 
rates. With the current economic conditions, many smaller companies without significant cash reserves are 
suffering which is reflected lower office rents in aggregate.

Revenue from Investment Properties
For the year end December 31, 2014, Revenue from Investment Properties reached $1,822,392 versus $1,650,895 
in the prior year.   This increase was attributable to higher achieved market lease rates.

Revenue from Other Sources
Revenue from other sources consists of late fees and other income.  For the year ending December 31, 2014, 
revenues from other sources totaled $96,524 compared to $76,478 for the year ending December 31, 2013.  
Revenues increased due to higher late payments collected along with higher income from property disposals in 
comparison to the previous year.

Fair Value Adjustment on Investment Properties
As elected under IFRS, the Corporation's investment portfolio is subsequently measured at fair value in the 
Corporation's financial statements.  As of December 31, 2014, the Corporation had approximately 90% of 
its Investment Properties Portfolio valued by either an international valuation firm and the remaining 10% (23 
properties) were valued by Management. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the fair value adjustment to 
investment properties was a gain of $10,683,896 compared to a gain of $3,845,521 for the same period in 2013. 
Overall, the gains in the portfolio were attributed to two of the Corporation's land packages that were assembled 



12  | Mongolia Growth Group Ltd.

through several transactions.  In aggregate, most of the remaining investment properties depreciated in Canadian 
dollar terms.

Property Operating Expenses
Property Operating Expenses consist of repairs and maintenance, bad debts, utilities, salaries and land and 
property taxes.  For the year ending December 31, 2014 the property operating expenses were $1,556,367 
compared to $1,398,184 during the same period in 2013, representing an increase of 11%.   This increase is mainly 
attributed to an increase in salaries, utilities and land and property taxes.  

Corporate Expenses
Corporate expenses include senior management's compensation, share-based costs, listing fees, professional 
fees, technology, travel and administrative costs.

For the year ending December 31, 2014 general and administration expenses increased to $4,635,599 from 
$3,680,336 in 2013. The majority of this increase was due to spending for initiatives that never materialized, 
increased investor outreach, legal expenses, increased human resource recruitment and retention costs and 
costs related to the management change at year-end. In addition, the Corporation experienced several one-time 
expenses.

One-Time Expenses
During the 2014 year, the Corporation incurred one–time expenses including; severance to of the Corporation's 
former CEO of $870,540, accrued a commission payment of $487,522 to a senior employee of the Corporation 
for several recent large acquisitions, a discount of $402,339 given to UMC against sale of Mandal Insurance and 
$222,995 spent on legal and professional fees to file a base shelf prospectus. These four major expenses total 
to $1,983,396. In 2013, one-time major expenses included TSX listing fees, fees for a transaction that did not 
materialize and expenses incurred on disposal of the Corporation's insurance subsidiary totaling $632,009. 

At this time, management does not foresee any significant one-time expenses during 2015. 

Currency
The Mongolian Tögrög has fluctuated significantly over the past three years.  The Mongolian Tögrög has 
depreciated 6.8%, 5.1%, 11.5% and 5.3% in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively versus the Canadian Dollar.  
The fluctuation in the currency is reflected in the Corporation's financial statements, most notably in the investment 
property portfolio, as it is the largest item on the balance sheet.  Note 4 in the financial statements disclose the 
foreign exchange adjustment, which flows through the investment property classification during each period.  As at 
December 31, 2014 the Corporation recognized a significant foreign exchange adjustment loss of $1,375,377 to its 
investment property portfolio due to the 5.3% depreciation of the local currency during the year.  

Operating Profit (Loss) from Continuing Operations 
In total the Corporation's continuing operations reported an Operating loss or an Adjusted EBITDA loss of 
$5,900,540 during 2014 (2013 – loss of $3,733,368), generated interest income of $66,606 (2013 - $239,055) and 
finance expense of $250,230 (2013 – Nil) during the year.  The larger Adjusted EBITDA loss in 2014 is attributed to 
the large one-time expenses mentioned earlier as well as increased salaries, property taxes and the discount of 
$402,339 given to UMC in exchange for early repayment of a debt.

generated an Operating loss or Adjusted EBITDA loss of $711,146 and investment income of $543,045.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Corporation incurred a net gain of $4,151,782 compared to a net loss 
of $155,563 for the year ended December 31, 2013.  This improvement is attributed to the substantial unrealized 
gain on fair value adjustment on investment properties of $10,683,896 during the year versus the unrealized gain of 
$3,845,521 from the prior year.  

Management cautions investors that the Corporation is primarily focused on increasing shareholder value on a per 
share basis. This means that operationally, management is more concerned with long-term asset appreciation at 
the expense of short-term cash flow. However, the newly installed CEO and board have taken an active focus on 
the Corporation's negative cash flow as they recognize that the Corporation cannot continue to suffer from negative 
cash flow.

investing activities. Management expects to meet all of the Corporation's obligations through current 

cash and cash equivalents along with cash flows from operations.

and investing each higher than the previous year offset by an increase in financing inflows.  The 

changes in components of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year 

ended December 31, 2013 were the result of the following factors: 

 

• Operating–Operating cash outflows for the year ended 2014 increased primarily due to an 

increase in one-time expenses. 

• Investing–Investing cash outflows for the year ended 2014 increased due to acquisitions of 

investment properties netted off by the receipt of payment on the disposal of 

insurance subsidiary as well as from disposal of properties in comparison to the 

previous year.  

• Financing–Financing cash inflows for the year ended 2014 increased over 2013 as the 

Corporation generated increased cash through the exercise of options.

$1,645,421 (2013 - $5,370,319) was held in cash and cash equivalents.

The majority of the Corporation's assets are classified as Non-Current Assets, mainly Investment Properties.

acquisition and the appreciation of the portfolio during the year.

In 2014, assets classified as Investment Properties increased to $48,458,517 from $32,313,391 the year prior, 
primarily due to an increase in unrealized fair value adjustment and the acquisition of Tulguldur.  Property and 
Equipment, which primarily consists of properties that are measured at their cost base, decreased from $3,915,692 
in 2013 to $2,974,950 in 2014 as several properties in this category were either sold or transferred to Investment 
Properties.  

In 2013, as part of the agreement to sell Mandal to UMC Capital LLC, proceeds for this transaction were included in 
current assets and non-current assets.  As the payment for this transaction was received during 2014, this item was

Revenue 

During the fourth quarter, the Corporation's real estate subsidiary earned total revenue of $316,712 

(Q4 2013 -$427,836) of which rental income earned was $457,496 (Q4 2013 - $397,894). The majority 

of this rental income increase is attributed to a larger property portfolio as well as increased 

occupancy levels.  The quarterly revenue number also includes other revenue earned from 

miscellaneous sources such as late fee, advertising and from sale of investment properties. During the 

fourth quarter, the Corporation also experienced a loss on sale of investment properties of $140,423, 

which negatively affected the Corporation's revenue. 

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Corporation 's net investment income decreased by $12,405 as 

compared to an increase of $36,736 in the same period in 2013.  The decrease in net investment 

income is attributable to a decrease in investment and marketable securities as the Corporation 

continues to deploy its cash into building its property portfolio. 

During the 4th quarter of 2014, the Corporation also incurred a large unrealized gain of $2,747,150 

compared to an unrealized gain of $3,845,521 during Q4 2013. 

Expenses 

Quarterly expenses related to corporate operations totaled $2,007,286 (Q4 2013 - $1,024,256).  The 

majority of this increase is attributed to a $870,540 severance payment made to the Corporation's 

former CEO along with a commission of $487,522 accrued to a senior employee of the Corporation.

Net Income
During the quarter, the Corporation generated a gain of $117,251 in comparison to a gain of $1,201,133 in the same 
quarter of the previous year. This difference is mainly attributed to the fair value adjustments recorded in the fourth 
quarter of the years offset by an increase in expenses.

Section 6 – Critical Estimates 

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS required Management to make assumptions 
about the future that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.  Estimates and judgments are continually 
evaluated based on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  In the future, actual experience may differ from these 
estimates and assumptions.  

The critical estimates made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include the following:

Fair value of Investment Properties 
The estimate of fair value of investment properties is the most critical accounting estimate to the Corporation.  An 
external appraiser estimates the fair value of the majority of the Investment Properties annually, the remainder are 
appraised internally by Management.  The fair value of investment properties is based on the nature, location and 
condition of the specific asset.  The fair value of investment properties represents an estimate of the price that 
would be made in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties.  The Corporation operates 
in the emerging real estate market of Mongolia, which given its current economic and industry conditions, has an 
increased inherent risk resulting from the lack of reliable and comparable market information.  At December 31, 
2014, the unrealized gain on fair value adjustment was a gain of $10,683,896 (gain of $3,845,521; 2013).   During 
the first six months of 2014, there was a fair value adjustment gain of $7,936,746 relating to properties that were 
not available for use at year end or were being carried at depreciated cost, and thus were recorded at the lower of 
cost and market, but adjusted during the first six months of 2014 as the properties became available for use.  The 
remaining $2,747,150 gain was adjusted during the 4th quarter of 2014.  As of December 31, 2014, Management 
took the decision to write off the carrying value of one of the Corporation's land assets as the asset had been 
impaired and Management believed it was unlikely that it could fully recover the asset in the future. 

Accuracy of Share Based Compensation Expense 
The estimate of the ultimate expense arising from share based compensation plans is another critical accounting 
estimate.  There are several sources of uncertainty that need to be considered in the estimate of the share based 
compensation expense recorded by the Corporation.  The ultimate expense is estimated by using a number of key 
assumptions such as the expected volatility of the share price, the dividends expected on the shares, the risk free 
interest rate for the expected life of the options and future forfeiture rates.  For the year ending December 31, 2014, 
the cost of the share based payments) totaled $1,838,904 (2013 - $931,783).  The increase over the previous year 
was due to a large amount of options issued to the Corporation's former CEO. 

Operating Environment of the Corporation
Mongolia displays many characteristics of an emerging market including relatively high inflation and interest rates.  
The tax and customs legislation in Mongolia is subject to varying interpretations and frequent changes.  The future 
economic performance of Mongolia is tied to continuing demand from China and continuing high global prices for 
commodities as well as being dependent upon the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary measures 
undertaken by the Government of Mongolia together with tax, legal, regulatory and political developments.  
Management is unable to predict all developments that could have an impact on the Mongolian economy and 
consequently what effect, if any, they could have on the future financial position of the Corporation.

Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale
The Corporation makes judgments in determining whether certain non-current assets or group of assets and 
liabilities meet the specified criteria under IFRS for classification as held for sale.  At December 31, 2014, the 
Corporation has identified 6 investment properties, which meet the specified criteria, and has accounted for them 
as assets held for sale.



Mongolia Growth Group Ltd. |  19

Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that deductible temporary differences will 
reverse in the foreseeable future and there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which the deductible 
temporary differences can be utilized. The Corporation reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the 
end of each reporting period which is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that deferred tax assets 
recognized will be recovered, or increased to the extent that sufficient future taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset to be recovered.  Estimates of future taxable income 
are based on forecasted cash flows from operations, available tax planning opportunities and expected timing of 
reversals of taxable temporary differences.

Section 7 – Risk Management

Credit risk
The Corporation's exposure to credit risk is managed through risk management policies and procedures with 
emphasis on the quality of the investment portfolio.  For the year, most of the Corporation's credit risk consisted of 
institutional deposits.  The majority of the funds invested are held in reputable Canadian or Mongolian banks.  The 
Corporation is in the early stages of development and is continually improving its policies in regards to monitoring 
its credit risk.

The Corporation is exposed to credit risk as an owner of real estate in which tenants may become unable to pay 
contracted rents.  The Corporation mitigates this risk by carrying out due diligence on significant tenants.  The 
Corporation's properties are diversified across residential and commercial classes. Historically, bad debts have not 
been a substantial expense for the Corporation.

Liquidity risk
The Corporation does not believe its current maturity profile lends itself to any material liquidity risk, taking into 
account the level of cash and cash equivalents, investments and marketable securities as at December 31, 2014.  

As at December 31, 2014, the Corporation had working capital of $596,123 (2013- $8,538,467) comprised of cash 
and cash equivalents, other assets, net of trade and accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. Management 
considers the funds on hand to be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations.

As of December 31, 2014, the Corporation does not have any contractual obligations. 

Currency risk
The Corporation owns properties located in Mongolia and collects rental revenue in Mongolian Tögrög, and is 
therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuations that may impact its financial position and results.  Changes in 
the Mongolian Tögrög, U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar foreign currency exchange rates impact the fair value of 
securities denominated in Mongolian Tögrög and in U.S. dollars.  

Economic Volatility and Uncertainty
Over the past few years, economic volatility and uncertainty around the world has contributed to dramatically 
restricted access to capital and reduced capital markets activity for more speculative businesses.  The 
Corporation's management believes that the Corporation has sufficient resources to carry on its business and 
remain a going concern. 

MGG holds the majority of its assets, investments and operations in the nation of Mongolia. Mongolia is presently 
experiencing drastic changes in its fast growing economy. Economic volatility and uncertainty in Mongolia could 
result in inflation, hyperinflation, economic stagnation, political extremism, and other similarly detrimental scenarios 
which could materially harm the Corporation.

While inflation subsided in 2013, the consequences of loose monetary policy as well as exchange rate depreciation 
emerged in 2014 through rising inflation levels. The inflation rate peaked at 14.9% in July but gradually decreased 
towards the end of the year due to weakening domestic demand. As reported by the National Statistics Office, 
year over year inflation was 11% in December, 11.5% in November, 12.1% in October and 13% in September.  The 
Bank of Mongolia raised the policy rate by 1.5 points to 12.0% in July in an effort to curb inflation.

Depending on the requirements of MGG's businesses, additional funds may be required to be raised in the capital 
markets and there is no guarantee that sufficient funds raised will be available to complete a financing required to 
augment the Corporation's operations. 



Mongolia Growth Group Ltd. |  21

Risks and Uncertainties
The Corporation, as part of its operations, carries financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, 
investments and marketable securities, accounts receivable, and trade payables and accrued liabilities.  It is 
Management's opinion that the Corporation is not exposed to significant credit, interest or currency risks arising 
from these financial instruments except as otherwise disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Certain members of parliament have recently asked to re-negotiate the agreement that exists between 
the government of Mongolia and Turquoise Hill regarding the current tax stability agreement.  There can be no 
certainty if any changes to the agreement will be reached and how it will impact the investment climate or future 
GDP growth of Mongolia.

Further information related to Mongolia Growth Group Ltd. and the risks and uncertainties of MGG is filed on the 
System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ("SEDAR") and can be reviewed at www.sedar.com. 

Financial Instruments
The Corporation's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments and marketable 
securities, accounts receivable and trade and accrued payables.  The Corporation is subject to interest risk as it 
earns interest income from its cash deposits.  It is Management's opinion that the Corporation is not exposed to 
significant credit risks arising from these financial instruments and that the fair value of these financial instruments 
approximates their carrying values.  Management believes that there are material currency risks associated to 
certain Financial Instruments of the Corporation as they are held in Mongolian Tögrög. For further discussion of 
financial instrument risks, see the Insurance and Financial Risk Management note. 

Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
Changes in securities laws no longer require the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of junior 
reporting issuers to certify that they have designed internal control over financial reporting, or caused it to be 
designed under their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.

Instead, an optional form of certification has been made available to junior reporting issuers and has been used by 
the Corporation's certifying officers for the December 31, 2013 annual filings. The new certification reflects what 
the Corporation considers to be a more appropriate level of CEO and CFO certification given the size and nature of 
the Corporation's operations. This certification requires the certifying officers to state that: they have reviewed the 
interim MD&A and consolidated financial statements; they have determined that there is no untrue statement of a 
material fact, or any omission of material fact required to be stated which would make a statement or its omission 
misleading in light of the circumstances under which it was made within the interim MD&A and consolidated 
financial statements; based on their knowledge, the interim filings, together with the other financial information 
included in the  interim filings, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and 
cash flows of the Corporation as of the date and for the periods presented in the filings.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and 
financial liabilities. Under IFRS 9, financial assets are classified and measured based on the business model in 
which they are held and the characteristics of their contractual cash flows. IFRS 9 also introduced additional 
changes related to financial liabilities.

The IASB also recently introduced amendments to IFRS related to hedge accounting. The Standard is not 
applicable until annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015, but is available for early adoption.

In November 2013, the IASB issued three amendments affecting IFRS 9, IAS 7 and IAS 39. The first amendment 
sets out new hedge accounting requirements. The second amendment allows entities to apply the accounting for 
changes from own credit risk in isolation without applying the other requirements of IFRS 9. The third amendment 
removes the mandatory effective date of IFRS 9 from January 1, 2015 to a new date that will be determined when 
IFRS 9 is closer to completion.

Independent Auditor's Report

To the Shareholders of
Mongolia Growth Group Ltd.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Mongolia Growth Group Ltd. and its
subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2014 and 2013
and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows
for the years then ended, and the related notes, which comprise a summary of significant accounting policies
and other explanatory information.

Management's responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's
preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Mongolia Growth Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries as at December 31, 2014 and 2013 and their
financial performance and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards.

1 Corporate information 

Mongolia Growth Group Ltd. (MGG or the Company) was incorporated in Alberta on 
December 17, 2007, and is a real estate investment and development company participating in 
the growth of the Mongolian economy through the ownership of commercial investment property 
assets in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  

The Company's common shares were previously listed on the Canadian National Stock Exchange 
(CNSX). On January 9, 2013, the Company filed an application for the de-listing of the common 
shares from the CNSX and filed an application for the listing of common shares on the TSX 
Venture Exchange (TSXV). The Company is now listed on the TSXV, having the symbol YAK. 

MGG has one wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31, 2014, Mongolia Barbados Corp. 
Mongolia Barbados Corp. owns the wholly-owned subsidiaries MGG Properties LLC and Big Sky 
Capital LLC. Big Sky Capital LLC owns the wholly-owned subsidiaries, Carrollton LLC, Biggie 
Industries LLC, Orpheus LLC, Endymion LLC, Zulu LLC, Crescent City LLC, Main Street 
Acquisitions LLC (formerly known as Tchoupitoulos LLC), and Oceanus LLC (together "the 
investment property operations"). The investment property operations are conducted in Big Sky 
Capital LLC and its subsidiaries. No active business operations occur in Mongolia Barbados 
Corp., MGG Properties LLC, Oceanus LLC, and Main Street Acquisitions LLC at this time. 

Prior to December 20, 2013, through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Mandal General 
Insurance, the Company offered insurance products in Mongolia covering all common general 
insurance types. The Company's main lines of business were motor insurance, including 
voluntary motor third party liability, property, accident medical and travel and liability 
insurance. Mandal General Insurance was disposed of on December 20, 2013 and was therefore 
not a part of the Company as at December 31, 2014 (see note 5). 

The Company is registered in Alberta, Canada, with its Head Office at its registered address at 
1400, 700-2nd Street W, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The Company's Canadian headquarters are 
located at 100 King Street West, Suite 5600, Toronto, Ontario, M5X 1C9, Canada. The Company's 
Mongolian investment property operations are based out of its office located at the Mandal 
Building, at the corner of Chinggis Ave. and Seoul St. in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. 

At December 31, 2014, the Company is organized into two business units based on the business 
operations: 

• Big Sky Capital LLC and its subsidiaries own investment properties which are located in 
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and are held for the purpose of generating rental revenue, capital 
appreciation, and/or redevelopment; and 

• The MGG Corporate office is located in Toronto, Canada and administers the financial 
resources, investment portfolio and corporate reporting and legal functions of the 
Company. 

 

2 Basis of presentation 

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting

Standards Board (IASB). The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are summarized in note 3. 

The consolidated financial statements, including the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements, are presented in Canadian dollars ($) which is the Company's presentation currency 
and the functional currency of the parent company. The functional currency of the Company's 
operating subsidiaries is the Mongolian National Tögrög (MNT). 

These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors of the Company 
for issue on April 29, 2015. 

3 Significant accounting policies 

a. Basis of measurement  

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties.  

b. Basis of consolidation  

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MGG and its wholly-
owned subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by MGG. Control exists when MGG 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial 
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as MGG, using 
consistent accounting policies. Intercompany balances and transactions, and any 
unrealized income and expenses arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. Upon the disposal of a subsidiary, 
amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity, 
are reclassified to income or loss.  

c. Financial instruments 

Financial assets 

Financial assets are classified into one of the following categories:  AFS, fair-value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL), or loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose 
for which the asset was acquired. All transactions related to financial instruments are 
recorded on a trade date basis. The Company's accounting policy for each category is as 
follows: 

i) Fair value through profit or loss 

Financial assets at FVTPL are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is 
classified in this category if it is acquired principally for selling in the short term. 
Derivatives are also categorized as held for trading unless they are designated as 
hedges.  FVTPL instruments are carried at fair value in the consolidated statement of 
financial position with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of 
operations.

ii) Loans and receivables    

These assets are non-derivative financial assets resulting from the delivery of cash or 
other assets by a lender to a borrower in return for a promise to repay on a specific date 
or dates, or on demand. They are initially recognized at cost, being the fair value of the 
consideration paid for the acquisition of the investment. After initial measurement, 
loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate 
method, less any impairment losses. Amortized cost is calculated taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and includes fees that are an integral part of 
the effective interest rate and transaction costs. 

Impairment on financial assets 

All financial assets other than FVTPL instruments are assessed for impairment at each 
reporting date. The Company assesses whether there is any objective evidence that a 
financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or group of 
financial assets is deemed to be impaired, if, and only if, there is objective evidence of 
impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition 
of the asset and that event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial 
asset or group of financial assets.  

Financial liabilities 

Financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities, based on the purpose for 
which the liability was incurred, and are comprised of trade payables and accrued liabilities. 
These liabilities are initially recognized at fair value net of any transaction costs directly 
attributable to the issuance of the instrument and subsequently carried at amortized cost 
using the effective interest rate method. This ensures that any interest expense over the 
period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the 
statement of financial position.  Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction 
costs and premiums payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while 
the liability is outstanding.  

Trade payables and accrued liabilities represent liabilities for goods and services provided to 
the Company prior to the end of the period which are unpaid. Trade payable amounts are 
unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. 

Fair value of financial instruments	
  

Fair value represents the price at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an 
orderly market, in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties 
who are under no compulsion to act.  Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in 
the consolidated statement of financial position are measured and classified in a hierarchy 
consisting of three levels for disclosure purposes. The three levels are based on the priority 
of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest 
priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the 
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability's classification within 
the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. The 
input levels are defined as follows:

• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in 
an active market for identical assets or liabilities. 

• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in markets 
that are not active or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e., as price) or indirectly (derived from prices). 

• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from unobservable inputs that 
are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the estimated fair 
value of the assets or liabilities. 

	
  

The Company has implemented the following classifications:	
  

Level 1:  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities 

• The Company defines active markets based on the frequency of valuation and any 
restrictions or illiquidity on disposition of investments. The size of the bid/ask spread is 
used as an indicator of market activity for fixed maturity securities. Assets measured at 
fair value and classified as Level 1 include cash and cash equivalents, and investments 
and marketable securities. Fair value is based on market price data for identical assets 
obtained from the investment custodian, investment managers or dealer markets. The 
Company does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments. 

Level 2:  Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are 
observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from 
prices) 

• Level 2 inputs include observable market information, including quoted prices for assets 
in markets that are considered less active. Assets measured at fair value and classified as 
Level 2 include investments and marketable securities. Fair value is based on or derived 
from market price data for same or similar instruments obtained from the investment 
custodian, investment managers or dealer markets.  

Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market 
activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the assets or 
liabilities 

• Level 3 assets and liabilities would include financial instruments whose values are 
determined using internal pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or 
similar techniques that are not based on observable market data, as well as assets or 
liabilities for which the determination of estimated fair value requires significant 
management judgement or estimation.     

	
  
d. Investment properties 

Investment properties include properties held to earn rental revenue, for capital 
appreciation, and/or for redevelopment. Investment properties are initially measured at fair 
value which is most often the purchase price plus any directly attributable expenditures. 
Investment properties are subsequently measured at fair value, which reflects market 
conditions at the date of the statement of financial position. Gains or losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of investment properties are recognized in the consolidated

statement of operations in the year they arise. A key characteristic of an investment property 
is that it generates cash flows largely independently of the other assets held by an entity. 
Subsequent expenditure is included in the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to 
the consolidated statement of operations during the financial period in which they occur. 
Substantially all of the Company's income properties and properties under development are 
investment properties. 

Properties under development are measured at cost.  

Certain land leases held under an operating lease are classified as investment properties 
when the definition of an investment property is met. At inception these leases are 
recognized at the lower of the fair value of the property and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. 

Some properties may be partially occupied by the Company, with the remainder being held 
for rental income or capital appreciation. If that part of the property occupied by the 
Company can be sold separately, the Company accounts for the portions separately. The 
portion that is owner-occupied is accounted for under IAS 16, and the portion that is held 
for rental income, capital appreciation or both is treated as investment property under IAS 
40. When the portions cannot be sold separately, the whole property is treated as 
investment property only if an insignificant portion is owner-occupied. The Company 
considers the owner-occupied portion as insignificant when the property is more than 90% 
held to earn rental income or capital appreciation. In order to determine the percentage of 
the portions, the Company uses the size of the property measured in square metres. 
 
The fair value of investment properties was based on the nature, location and condition of 
the specific asset. The fair value is calculated at December 31, 2014 on the majority of 
investment properties by an independent, professional, qualified appraisal firm, whose 
appraisers hold recognized relevant, professional qualifications and who have recent 
experience in the locations and categories of the investment properties valued. The 
remaining investment properties' fair value was calculated by management and was 
performed by qualified individuals with recent experience in the locations and categories of 
the investment properties valued. 
 
Investment property purchases where the Company has paid either the full or partial 
purchase proceeds to the seller, but the Company has not yet received the official land or 
building title from the Mongolian Property office are recorded at the lower of cost and fair 
value as Prepaid deposits on investment properties and classified within other assets. 
	
  

e. Assets held for sale 

Assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are categorized as held for sale at 
the point in time when the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale, 
management has committed to a plan to sell and is actively locating a buyer at a sales price 
that is reasonable in relation to the current fair value of the asset, and the sale is probable 
and expected to be completed within a one year period. Investment property that is to be 
disposed of without redevelopment has been determined to not have a change in use and 
continues to be recorded in investment property. Investment property that has evidence of 
commencement of redevelopment with a view to sell is transferred to assets held for sale.

Investment properties are measured by the guidelines of IAS 40 - Investment Property. All 
other assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amounts and fair value less 
selling costs. An asset that is subsequently reclassified as held and in use, with the exception 
of investment property measured under the fair value model, is measured at the lower of its 
recoverable amount and the carrying value that would have been recognized had the asset 
never been classified as held for sale. 

f. Revenue recognition 

Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to 
the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable. The Company's specific revenue 
recognition criteria are as follows: 

i) Rental revenue 

The Company has not transferred substantially all of the benefits and risk of ownership 
of its investment properties and, therefore, the Company accounts for leases with its 
tenants as operating leases. Rental revenue includes all amounts earned from tenants 
related to lease agreements including property tax and operating cost recoveries. 

The Company reports minimum rental revenue on a straight-line basis, whereby the 
total amount of cash to be received under a lease is recognized into earnings in equal 
periodic amounts over the term of the lease. 

Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned. 

Amounts payable by tenants to terminate their lease prior to their contractual expiry 
date (lease cancellation fees) are included in rental revenue at the time of cancellation. 

Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying 
amount of the leased asset. Tenant incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental 
revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 

ii) Investment income  

Investment income is recorded as it accrues using the effective interest method. 

g. Cash and cash equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, deposits held at call with banks, other 
short-term bank deposits and highly liquid investments with an original term to maturity of 
three months or less at the date of purchase that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. 

h. Property and equipment  

On initial recognition, property and equipment are valued at cost, being the purchase price 
and directly attributable cost of acquisition or construction required to bring the asset to the 
location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in a manner intended by the

Company, including appropriate borrowing costs and the estimated present value of any 
future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items.  

Property and equipment is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, 
less any accumulated impairment losses. All repairs and maintenance costs are charged to 
the consolidated statement of operations during the period in which they occur.  

Depreciation is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and is provided on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows:  

Buildings    Straight-line over 40 years  
Furniture and fixtures   Straight-line over 5 to 10 years  
Equipment    Straight-line over 1 to 5 years  
Vehicles    Straight-line over 10 years  
 

Impairment reviews are performed when there are indicators that the net recoverable 
amount of an asset may be less than the carrying value. The net recoverable amount is 
determined as the higher of an asset's fair value less cost to dispose and value in use. 
Impairment is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations, when there is 
objective evidence that a loss event has occurred which has impaired future cash flows of an 
asset. In the event that the value of previously impaired assets recovers, the previously 
recognized impairment loss is recovered in the consolidated statement of operations at that 
time.  

An item of property and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no further 
economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of 
the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in the consolidated statement of operations in the period 
the asset is derecognized.  

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year 
end and adjusted if appropriate.  

i. Income taxes  

Income taxes are comprised of both current and deferred taxes. Current tax and deferred tax 
are recognized in the statement of operations except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognized in OCI or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is recognized in OCI or directly 
in equity respectively.  

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date in the 
countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income and 
are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities for the current and prior periods.  

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future income tax 
consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or 
income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are provided for using the liability method. 
Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for all significant

temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases for assets and liabilities 
and for certain carry-forward items, such as losses and tax credits not utilized from prior 
years. However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or a 
liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable income, it is not accounted for.  

Recognition of deferred tax assets for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible 
temporary differences is restricted to those instances where, in the opinion of management, 
it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deferred tax asset 
can be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of 
changes in tax laws and rates, on the date the changes in tax laws and rates have been 
enacted or substantively enacted.  

j. Foreign exchange transactions  

Foreign currency transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the dates 
they occur. Gains and losses arising as a result of foreign currency transactions are 
recognized in the current year consolidated statement of operations.  

Translation of foreign operations  

For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position 
of the Mongolian operations are expressed in Canadian dollars, which is the functional 
currency of the parent, and the presentation currency of the consolidated financial 
statements.  

The Company translates the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of its Mongolian 
operations which have a functional currency of Mongolian Tögrög , to Canadian dollars on 
the following basis:  

• Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate of exchange in effect at the 
consolidated statement of financial position date. 

• Income and expense items are translated using the average rate for the month in 
which they occur, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of actual 
rates.  

• Equity items are translated at their historical rates.  
• The translation adjustment from the use of different rates is included as a separate 

component of equity.  
 

k. Comprehensive income  

Comprehensive income consists of net income (loss) and OCI. OCI includes changes in 
unrealized gains (losses) on the translation of financial statement operations with 
Mongolian Tögrög functional currency. 

	
  
l.  Share capital and deferred share issuance costs 

Ordinary shares issued by the Company are classified as equity. Costs directly identifiable 
with the raising of capital will be charged against the related share issue, net of any tax

effect. Costs related to shares not yet issued are recorded as deferred financing costs. These 
costs will be deferred until the issuance of the shares to which the costs relate, at which time 
the costs will be charged against the related share issuance or charged to operations if the 
shares are not issued.  

m. Share based payment  

The Company offers share based payment plans for directors, executive management, key 
employees and other key service providers. The purpose of the share based payment plan is 
to enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain Directors, executive 
management, key employees and other key service providers whose training, experience and 
ability will contribute to the effectiveness of the Company and to directly align their interests 
with the interests of shareholders.  

The Company's share based payment plans provide for the granting of stock options to 
independent Directors, executive management, key employees and other key service 
providers. Each stock option entitles the participant to receive one common share and can 
only be settled with the issuance of common shares, and as a result, is deemed to be an 
equity-settled share based payment transaction. Additionally, the Company will at times 
grant restricted stock of the Company under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Plan. 
Restrictions on such shares are removed as the vesting conditions are met. For restricted 
shares, the holder is entitled to all dividend payments during the vesting period. Share based 
payment expense is measured based on the fair market value of the Company's shares at the 
grant date. The associated compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period or 
service period, whichever is shorter based on the number of rewards that are expected to 
vest. 

Share based payment arrangements to other key service providers in which the Company 
receives properties, goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are 
measured at fair value.  

The fair value of stock options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model. The fair value of restricted shares granted is measured using the market price of the 
Company's shares.  

Agent options granted as compensation for the issuance of shares are charged to share issue 
costs.  

Any consideration received upon the exercise of stock options is credited to common shares. 
In the event that vested stock options expire without being exercised, previously recorded 
compensation costs associated with such options are not reversed.  

n. Discontinued operations  

A discontinued operation is a component of the Company's business that represents a 
separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of 
or is held for sale or distribution, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. 
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets 
the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified as a 
discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or loss and other

comprehensive income is restated as if the operation had been discontinued from the start 
of the comparative period.  

The results of operations associated with disposal groups sold, or classified as held for sale, 
are reported separately as income or loss from discontinued operations.  

o. Earnings (loss) per share  

For both continuing and discontinued operations, the Company presents basic and diluted 
earnings (loss) per share (EPS) data for its common shares. Basic EPS is calculated by 
dividing the results of operations attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by 
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS 
is determined by adjusting the results of operations attributable to common shareholders 
and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all 
dilutive potential common shares, which comprise share options. 

p.  Segment reporting 

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting 
provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is 
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of operations, has been 
identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The Company is now managed as two operating 
segments based on how information is produced internally for the purpose of making 
operating decisions. The segments are defined as investment property operations and 
corporate. Previously to 2014, the Company's insurance operations were managed and 
segmented separately. 

q. Leases  

The Company has entered into Mongolian government land leases on some of its investment 
properties. The Company, as a lessee, has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms 
and conditions of the arrangements, that these land leases meet the definition of an 
investment property and has classified them as such. At inception, these leases are 
recognized at the lower of the fair value of the property and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments.  

The Company has entered into commercial and residential property leases on its investment 
properties. The Company as a lessor, has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms 
and conditions of the arrangements, that it retains the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of these properties and therefore accounts for these agreements as operating 
leases.  

r. Provisions and contingent liabilities  

Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of the provision to be 
reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense of any provision is recognized in the

consolidated statement of operations net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time 
value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a borrowing cost.  

Contingent liabilities are disclosed if there is a possible future obligation as a result of a past 
event, or if there is a present obligation as a result of a past event but either a payment is not 
probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated.  

s. Changes in accounting policies  

The Company has adopted the following new and revised standards, along with any 
consequential amendments, effective January 1, 2014. These changes were made in 
accordance with the applicable transitional provisions.  

Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Amendments to IAS 32  

These amendments clarify the meaning of 'currently has a legally enforceable right to off-set 
and the criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify 
for offsetting and is applied retrospectively. These amendments have no impact on the 
Company, since none of the entities in the Company has any offsetting arrangements. 

Impairment of assets on the recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial 
assets – Amendments to IAS 36 

This amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs which had 
been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13. This amendments has no impact on the 
Company as the Company has not impaired any non-financial assets. 

IFRIC 21 Levies  

IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers 
payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon 
reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be 
anticipated before the specified minimum threshold is reached. Retrospective application is 
required for IFRIC 21. This interpretation has no impact on the Company as it has applied 
the recognition principles under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets consistent with the requirements of IFRIC 21 in prior years. 

Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle  

In the 2010-2012 annual improvements cycle, the IASB issued seven amendments to six 
standards, which included an amendment to IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. The 
amendment to IFRS 13 is effective immediately and, thus, for periods beginning at January 
1, 2014, and it clarifies in the Basis for Conclusions that short-term receivables and payables 
with no stated interest rates can be measured at invoice amounts when the effect of 
discounting is immaterial. This amendment to IFRS 13 has no impact on the Company.

Annual Improvements 2011-2013 Cycle  

In the 2011-2013 annual improvements cycle, the IASB issued four amendments to four 
standards, which included an amendment to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards. The amendment to IFRS 1 is effective immediately and, 
thus, for periods beginning at January 1, 2014, and clarifies in the Basis for Conclusions that 
an entity may choose to apply either a current standard or a new standard that is not yet 
mandatory, but permits early application, provided either standard is applied consistently 
throughout the periods presented in the entity's first IFRS financial statements. This 
amendment to IFRS 1 has no impact on the Company. 

t. Accounting standards issued but not yet effective  

A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for 
annual periods beginning after January 1, 2015 or later and have not been applied in 
preparing these consolidated financial statements. Those which are relevant to the 
Company are set out below. The Company does not plan to adopt these standards early and 
is continuing to evaluate the impact of such standards. 

Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle 

In the 2012-2014 annual improvements cycle, the IASB issued five amendments to four 
standards, and will apply to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016.  The 
amendments affect IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and IAS 34 Interim 
Financial Reporting.  The relevant proposed amendments are not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Company. 

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 

IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, first issued in November 2009 with final version released in 
July 2014 by the IASB, brings together the classification and measurement, impairment and 
hedge accounting phases of the IASB's project to replace IAS 39. IFRS 9 introduces a 
principles-based approach to the classification of financial assets based on an entity's 
business model and the nature of the cash flows of the asset. All financial assets, including 
hybrid contracts, are measured as at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), fair value 
through OCI or amortized cost.   

For financial liabilities, IFRS 9 includes the requirements for classification and 
measurement previously included in IAS 39.   

IFRS 9 also introduces an expected loss impairment model for all financial assets not as at 
FVTPL. The model has three stages: (1) on initial recognition, 12-month expected credit 
losses are recognized in profit or loss and a loss allowance is established; (2) if credit risk 
increases significantly and the resulting credit risk is not considered to be low, full lifetime 
expected credit losses are recognized; and (3) when a financial asset is considered credit-
impaired, interest revenue is calculated based on the carrying amount of the asset, net of the 
loss allowance, rather than its gross carrying amount.

Finally, IFRS 9 introduces a new hedge accounting model that aligns the accounting for 
hedge relationships more closely with an entity's risk management activities.  The standard 
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.   

The Company is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 9 and plans to adopt the new 
standard on the required effective date. 

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a new five-step model that will apply to 
revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange 
for transferring goods or services to a customer. The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more 
structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue. 

The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue 
recognition requirements under IFRS. Either a full or modified retrospective application is 
required for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017 with early adoption 
permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and plans to adopt the 
new standard on the required effective date. 

Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of 
Depreciation and Amortization 

The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of 
economic benefits that are generated from operating a business (of which the asset is part) 
rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset. As a result, a 
revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment and may 
only be used in very limited circumstances to amortize intangible assets. 

The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after  
January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have 
any impact to the Company given that the Company has not used a revenue-based method 
to depreciate its non-current assets. 

4 Significant accounting estimates and judgements  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions about the future that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experiences 
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and 
assumptions.  

The effect of a change in an accounting estimate is recognized prospectively by including it in 
net income (loss) in the period of the change, if the change affects that period only, or in the 
period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both.

Significant estimates made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements include 
the following areas:  

• Fair value of investment properties - The estimate of fair value of investment properties 
is the most critical accounting estimate to the Company. An external appraiser 
estimates the fair value of the majority of investment properties annually. The fair value 
of investment properties is based on the nature, location and condition of the specific 
asset. The fair value of investment properties represents an estimate of the price that 
would be made in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. 
The Company operates in the emerging real estate market of Mongolia, which given its 
current economic, political and industry conditions, gives rise to an increased inherent 
risk given the lack of reliable and comparable market information. The significant 
estimates underlying the fair value determination are disclosed in note 8. Changes in 
assumptions about these factors could materially affect the carrying value of investment 
properties.  

• Accuracy of share based compensation expense - The estimate of the ultimate expense 
arising from share based compensation plans is another critical accounting estimate. 
There are several sources of uncertainty that need to be considered in the estimate of 
the share based compensation expense recorded by the Company. The ultimate expense 
is estimated by using a number of key assumptions such as the expected volatility of the 
share price, the dividends expected on the shares, the risk-free interest rate for the 
expected life of the option and future forfeiture rates. Further information on key 
assumptions including sensitivity analysis is included in note 12.  

• Operating environment of the Company - Mongolia displays many characteristics of an 
emerging market including relatively high inflation and interest rates. The tax and 
customs legislation in Mongolia is subject to varying interpretations and frequent 
changes. The future economic performance of Mongolia is tied to the continuing 
demand from China and global prices for commodities as well as being dependent upon 
the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary measures undertaken by the 
Government of Mongolia together with tax, legal, regulatory and political 
developments. Management is unable to predict all developments that could have an 
impact on the Mongolian economy and consequently what effect, if any, they could have 
on the future financial position of the Company.  

 

5 Disposal of subsidiary 

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company disposed of its interest in Mandal 
General Insurance LLC (Mandal).  The Company held 100% of the shares of Mandal with net 
assets at the date of disposal of $2,484,624.  Management committed to a plan to sell this 
segment due to a strategic decision to place greater focus on the Company's core operation, being 
investment properties.

As part of this transaction, the Company filed a formal application with the Financial Regulatory 
Commission (FRC) of Mongolia to seek permission for disposal of Mandal, which was granted. 
The transaction closed on December 20, 2013 with the Company selling its stake to UMC Capital 
LLC (UMC) for consideration of $3,669,951. Cash consideration of $458,101 was paid at the date 
of closing with a further $223,978 received on September 30, 2014.  During the year, the 
Company amended the original payment terms in order to realise full payment of the remaining 
long-term receivable. As a result, the Company negotiated a discount on the consideration 
receivable of $402,339 and the remaining $2,585,533 was received in cash in November 2014. 
This discount of $402,339 has been recorded as an expense during the year ended December 31, 
2014.

value of $1,210,204 prior to their disposal.  Of these two properties sold, $1,060,223 
was classified as Investment properties and the remaining $149,981 as other assets as 
of December 31, 2013. A total gain of $122,810 was recorded as a result of this 
transaction due to the swap involved. 

In June 2014, the Company entered into a swap transaction to buy a redevelopment 
asset adjacent to the asset purchased during February 2014 in order to increase the size 
of the total redevelopment asset. The property was purchased for consideration of 
$1,799,357. The consideration for this purchase included one redevelopment asset 
carried at a fair value of $1,003,439 and $795,918 in cash. The gain recorded in this 
transaction by way of swap was $8,986. 

In December 2014, the Company entered into a swap transaction to acquire a piece of 
land for a total value of $775,121, adjacent to the asset purchased in February 2014. 
This included giving up two retail properties valued at $664,408 in a swap and 
$110,713 payable in cash out of which $61,596 was paid subsequent to year end. The 
swap resulted in a gain of $1,839. 

In addition to the five properties disposed of discussed above, an additional 20 
investment properties were sold for cash consideration of $2,450,441, resulting in net 
loss on disposal of $77,530. Furthermore, $271,024 was received as a deposit against a 
sale which later took place subsequent to the year end in February 2015.

Included in investment properties are properties actively being marketed for sale that are to be 
disposed of without redevelopment with a fair value of $1,109,821 (2013 - $2,883,050). During 
the year, the Company earned gross proceeds of $2,721,465 from sale of investment properties 
out of which $271,024 was a deposit against a property which was sold in February 2015 and 
$2,450,441 (2013 – $961,079) was the proceeds against sales of investment properties that took 
place during the year ended December 31, 2014. A loss of $77,530 (2013 - $17,906) on these 
transactions and a total gain of $133,635 (2013 – Nil) on transactions involving swap has been 
recorded in other revenue on the consolidated statement of operations. 

Investment properties with an aggregate fair value of $43,435,936 (2013 - $21,718,639) at 
December 31, were valued by an external independent valuation professional who is deemed to 
be qualified appraiser who holds a recognized, relevant, professional qualification and who has 
recent experience in the locations and categories of the investment properties valued. The

carrying value of investment properties valued by the external appraiser at December 31, 2014 
and 2013 agrees to the valuations reported by the external appraiser.  

The Company determined the fair value of investment properties using the income approach and 
the sales comparison approach, which are generally accepted appraisal methodologies.  

Under the income approach, the methodology used was the direct capitalization approach which 
is based on rental income and yields. Rental incomes were based on current rent and reasonable 
and supportable assumptions that represent what knowledgeable, willing parties would assume 
about rental income from future rent in light of current conditions adjusted for non-recoverable 
property costs. Yields were determined using data from real estate agencies, market reports and 
property location among other things in determining the appropriate assumptions. Under this 
method, year one income is stabilized and capped at a rate deemed appropriate for each 
investment property.  

The sales comparison approach analyzes all available information of sales of comparable 
properties that have recently taken place and adjusts the price to reflect differences in the 
property valued and sold. 

The entire portfolio of investment properties has been valued using the income approach, the 
sales comparison approach or a combination thereof. 

Under the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of the Company's investment properties is 
considered a level three, as defined in note 3. 

The key valuation assumptions for commercial investment properties are as follows: 

   2014 
       
  Maximum  Minimum  

Weighted- 
average 

       
Capitalization rate  11.5%  8%  9.75% 
	
  

  2013 
       
  Maximum  Minimum  

Weighted- 
average 

       
Capitalization rate  11.5%  7.5%  9.5% 
	
  

The following sensitivity table outlines the impact of a 0.25% change in the weighted average 
capitalization rate on investment properties at December 31, 2014: 

 

Change to fair value if 
capitalization rate 

increased 0.25%

Additional valuation assumptions include the rental revenue per square meter, grade quality of 
the property and comparable market data. Changes to these assumptions could have a material 
impact on the fair value of the Company's investment properties. 

Investment properties of $26,666,348 (2013 - $15,886,443) have no rental revenue associated 
with them at December 31, 2014. 

Investment properties include land held under operating leases with an aggregate fair value of 
$15,416,750  (2013 - $10,538,656 ) at December 31 2014. 

Certain investment properties held by the Company are leased out under operating leases. The 
future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases are as follows:

a) Deferred income taxes 

Differences between IFRS and statutory taxation regulations in Mongolia give rise to 
temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and their tax bases.  

The Company did not recognize a deferred tax asset in these consolidated financial 
statements as there is uncertainty with regard to the recoverability of the asset for both the 
Canadian and Mongolian entities.  

There are non-capital loss carry-forwards relating to the Mongolian entities that will expire 
in 2016 for which no future tax benefit has been recorded. The Company also did not 
recognize deferred tax assets related to taxable temporary differences. In accordance with 
Mongolian tax law, the taxable losses can be carried forward for two years and are 
deductible up to 50% of the taxable income of that year.

In accordance with Canadian tax law, the taxable losses can be forward twenty years. There 
are $7,935,753 (2013 - $5,419,472) of non-capital losses relating to the Canadian entity. 

The losses expire as follows:

The Company has established a share based payment plan (the "Plan") to encourage 
ownership of its shares by key management personnel (directors and executive 
management), employees and other key service providers, and to provide compensation for 
certain services. The Plan provides for the issuance of stock options in an aggregate number 
of up to 10% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares, calculated from time to time. 
At December 31, 2014, the Company had 1,036,874 (2013 - 1,473,335) common shares 
available for the granting of future options under the new plan. The Company does not have 
any cash-settled transactions. 

On March 1, 2013, 475,000 options were granted to employees and consultants of the 
Company. These options allow the holder to acquire common shares at a price of $4.13 per 
share for each option exercised. Of these options 375,000 vest in four equal annual tranches 
each year over four years and expire on March 1, 2018 and 125,000 of these options vested 
and became exercisable immediately and expire on March 1, 2016. 

On December 20, 2013, the Company disposed of its investment in Mandal General 
Insurance resulting in the immediate vesting of 143,000 shares. The options became 
exercisable immediately and expired on January 20, 2014. None of these options were 
exercised.  

On March 3, 2014, the Company issued 1,128,000 five year stock options at a price of $1.90 
per share and 35,000 three year stock options at a price of $1.90. Of these options issued, 
192,000 were issued in satisfaction of approximately $200,000 of directors fees which had 
been accrued at December 31, 2013. 

On December 15, 2014, the Company issued 375,000 five year stock options at a price of 
$1.09 to the Directors of the Company.  The options vested immediately. 

A summary of the Company's options as at December 31 and changes during the periods 
then ended follows:

During the year, 80,000 options were exercised at a price of $1.90, 60,000 options were 
exercised at a price of $1.64 and 250,000 options at a price of $1.75 were exercised for total cash 
proceeds of $687,900 (2013 – $65,600).  In addition, 30,393 RSAs vested increasing the shares 
issued by the same amount.  Of the RSAs which vested during the year, 7,000 were subsequently 
bought back by the Company.    

Additionally during 2014, 360,000 options with a weighted average exercise price of $4.08 were 
forfeited and 297,000 options with a weighted average exercise price of 4.20 were cancelled 
during this time. An additional 75,000 options with a weighted average exercise price of 4.20 
expired and were cancelled during the period. 

The fair value associated with the options issued in March was calculated using the Black-Scholes 
model for options valuation, assuming volatility of 77.5% (2013 - 90%) on the underlying units, a 
risk free interest rate of 1.39% (2013 - 1.19%) and a forfeiture rate of nil based on the composition 
of the option holders. The fair value associated with the options issued in December was 
calculated using the Black-Scholes model for options valuation, assuming volatility of 68.6% 
(2013 - 90%) on the underlying units, a risk free interest rate of 1.31% (2013 - 1.19%) and a 
forfeiture rate of nil based on the composition of the option holders. 

Share prices for the calculation were the closing price on the TSXV on the date of issue of the 
options. The Company has assumed the options will be exercised at the end of the term of the 
option. 

The Company considered its historical share price over the last four years in determining the 
volatility to use in the option valuation. In prior periods, given the lack of sufficient information 
on historical volatility, it also considered historical volatility of similar entities following a 
comparable period in their lives. 

The approximate impact of an increase of 1o% in the volatility assumption for the options issued 
in the current year would decrease net income of the Company by $106,687. The approximate 
impact of a decrease of 10% in the volatility assumption would increase net income of the 
Company by $116,905.

the grant (weighted average grant price of $2.33 per share) and was based on the market price of 
the Company's shares at that time. 

During the 2014 year, the Company recorded net compensation expense of $127,230 (2013 - 
$2,384) for the Restricted Share Plan within the share based payment expenses.

Weighted average number of shares - diluted  34,652,992  34,696,557 
 
Basic earnings (loss) per share are derived by dividing net income (loss) for the year by the 
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The effect of 
potentially dilutive securities is excluded if they are anti-dilutive. 

There have been no significant capital transactions from the reporting date to the date of 
this filing which have had a material impact on earnings per share.  

13 Management of capital structure 

The Company's objective when managing capital is to ensure the Company is capitalized in a 
manner which provides a strong financial position for its shareholders. 

The Company's capital structure includes equity and working capital. In managing its capital 
structure, the Company considers future investment and acquisition opportunities, potential

credit available and potential issuances of new equity. The Company's objective is to maintain a 
flexible capital structure that will allow it to execute its stated business. Upon acquiring 
investment properties and operating businesses, the Company will strive to balance its 
proportion of debt and equity within its capital structure in accordance with the needs of the 
continuing business. The Company may, from time to time, issue shares and adjust its spending 
to manage current and projected proportions as deemed appropriate. 

The method used by the Company to monitor its capital is based on an assessment of the 
Company's working capital position relative to its projected obligations. At December 31, 2014, 
the Company's working capital was $596,123 (2013 - $8,538,467) and the Company had no debt.

14 Financial risk management 

The Board of Directors ensures that management has put appropriate risk management 
processes in place. Through the Audit Committee, the Board oversees such risk management 
procedures and controls. Management provides updates to the Audit Committee on a quarterly 
basis with respect to risk management. 

The Company is no longer exposed to risks resulting from insurance contracts and the related 
claims as the Company has disposed of their insurance operations effective December 20, 2013 
(note 5). 

Catastrophe risk 

The Company obtained insurance on buildings and all permanent fixtures totalling 
approximately $24,600,000 (2013 - $28,700,000).  

Credit risk  

Credit risk is the risk of an unexpected financial loss to the Company if a third party fails to fulfill 
its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. The Company's credit risk 
arises principally from the Company's cash and cash equivalents and receivables.

The following table summarizes the Company's maximum exposure to credit risk on the 
consolidated statement of financial position. The maximum credit exposure is the carrying value 
of the asset, net of any allowances for loss.

$

Cash and cash equivalents  1,645,421  5,370,319 
Receivables  151,585  3,350,564 

     
Maximum credit risk exposure on the consolidated 

statement of financial position  1,797,006  8,720,883 
 
The Company's exposure to credit risk is managed through risk management policies and 
procedures with emphasis on the quality of the investment portfolio. The majority of the funds 
invested are held in reputable Barbadian, Canadian or Mongolian banks. The Company is in the 
early stages of development and is continually improving its policies regarding monitoring its 
credit risk. 

The Company is exposed to credit risk as an owner of real estate in that tenants may become 
unable to pay the contracted rents. The Company mitigates this risk by carrying out appropriate 
credit checks and related due diligence on the significant tenants. The Company's properties are 
diversified across residential and commercial classes. 

Liquidity risk  

Liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient cash resources to meet financial obligations 
without raising funds at unfavourable rates or selling assets on a forced basis. Liquidity risk 
arises from the general business activities and in the course of managing the assets and liabilities. 
The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet all financial 
commitments and obligations as they fall due. The liquidity requirements of the Company's 
business are met primarily by funds generated from operations, liquid investments and income 
and other returns received on investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily 
for investment property operating expenses.  

As at December 31, 2014, the Company does not believe the current maturity profile of the 
Company lends itself to any material liquidity risk, taking into account the level of cash and cash 
equivalents, investments and marketable securities as at December 31, 2014. The Company does 
not have material liabilities that can be called unexpectedly at the demand of a client.

Market risk 

Market risk includes interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk. 

i) Interest rate risk  

Interest rate risk is the potential for financial loss arising from changes in interest rates. 
Changes in interest rate levels generally impact the financial results to the extent that 
reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on fixed income securities. 
Changes in interest rates will affect the fair value of the fixed income securities. During 
periods of rising interest rates, the market value of the existing fixed income securities 
will generally decrease. During periods of declining interest rates the opposite is true.

The Company is not directly exposed to interest rate risk at December 31, 2014 and 
2013.	
  

ii) Currency risk  

Currency risk represents the risk that the Company incurs losses due to exposure to 
foreign currency fluctuations. The Company owns properties and carries out related 
business operations in Mongolia, and is therefore subject to foreign currency 
fluctuations that may impact its financial position and results.  

The approximate impact of an increase of 10% in the Mongolian Tögrög against the 
Canadian dollar would increase the OCI of the Company by $766,111 (2013 - 
$4,267,566). The approximate impact of a decrease of 10% in the Mongolian Tögrög 
against the Canadian dollar would decrease OCI of the Company by $935,558 (2013 - 
$4,267,566).  

iii) Other price risk 

Other price risk market fluctuation risk is where fluctuations in the value of equity 
securities affect the level and timing of recognition of gains and losses on securities 
held, and cause changes in realized and unrealized gains and losses. As the Company 
does not have any equity investments, it does not have any exposure to equity risk. 

Economic risk 

Mongolian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and 
changes, which can occur frequently. Management's interpretation of such legislation as applied 
to the transactions and activity of the Company may be challenged by tax authorities.  

Mongolian tax authorities may be taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the 
legislation and assessments, and it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been 
challenged in the past may be challenged by tax authorities. As a result, significant additional 
taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the 
authorities in respect of taxes for five calendar years preceding the year of review. Under certain 
circumstances reviews may cover longer periods. 

Mongolian tax legislation does not provide definitive guidance in certain areas, specifically in 
areas such as Value added tax (VAT), corporate income tax, personal income tax and other areas. 
From time to time, the Company adopts interpretations of such uncertain areas that reduce the 
overall tax rate of the Company. As noted above, such tax positions may come under heightened 
scrutiny as a result of recent developments in administrative and court practices. The impact of 
any challenge by the tax authorities cannot be reliably estimated; however, it may be significant 
to the financial position and/or the overall operations of the entity.  

The Company's management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is 
appropriate and the Company's tax positions will be sustained. Management believes that tax 
risks are remote at present.  

Management performs regular re-assessments of tax risk and its position may change in the 
future as a result of the change in conditions that cannot be anticipated with sufficient certainty 
at present.	
  

15 Related party transactions 

Parties are generally considered to be related if the parties are under common control or if one 
party has the ability to control the other party or can exercise significant influence or joint control

over the other party in making financial and operational decisions. In considering each possible 
related party relationship, attention is directed to the substance of the relationship, not merely 
the legal form.  

On August 8, 2013, the Company loaned a member of the key management $100,000 with a 
fixed interest rate of 6% payable back to the Company within six months from the loan date. The 
loan was fully repaid in February 2014. 

Key management personnel of the Company include all directors and executive management. 
The summary of compensation for key management personnel is as follows: 

  
2014

Termination benefits  870,540  - 

     
  2,237,857  1,162,805 
 

In addition to the above, during the period, the Company rented an office for total consideration 
of $4,746 (2013 - Nil) from a company in which a former director of the Company has a 
controlling interest.   

16 Commitments and contingencies 

From time to time and in the normal course of business, claims against the Company may be 
received. On the basis of management's assessments and professional legal advice, management 
is of the opinion that no material losses will be incurred and no provision or disclosure has been 
made in these consolidated financial statements. 

The Company indemnifies its directors and officers against any and all claims or losses 
reasonably incurred in the performance of their service to the Company to the extent permitted 
by law.
