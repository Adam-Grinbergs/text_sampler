December 21, 2019 (the "Effective Date").  During the last week of August 2019, Mr. Page 
spent 3.5 days at Aurania's Macas field office, and half a day in Quito meeting with Aurania's 
legal counsel and delivering check samples to the Bureau Veritas sample preparation facility.  
Mr. Phillips spent 4 days reviewing the Project at Aurania's Macas field office, 7 days in the 
field visiting 12 target areas, and a half day in Quito delivering check samples to the Bureau 
Veritas sample preparation facility.   
 
Owing to the large geographic scale of the project, and limited vehicular access to all but the 
western and southern margins of the Project, Mr. Page was only able to visit a single target 
area, Crunchy Hill, where Aurania had recently completed its initial drill program.  
Mr. Phillips, on his trip, was able to carry out site visits to the Awacha and Tsenken target 
areas.  Neither Mr. Page nor Phillips were able to visit most of the target areas covered by this 
Report.  Much of Section 9.5 is based on personal communications with Aurania geologists 
and consultants.   
 
1.2  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND OWNERSHIP  

The Lost Cities – Cutucú Exploration project consists of 42 mineral exploration concessions 
granted to EcuaSolidus S.A. ("EcuaSolidus") in December 2016, covering 207,764 Ha of the 
Cordillera de Cutucú in southeastern Ecuador.  Aurania acquired EcuaSolidus 
from Dr. Keith Barron, Chairman and CEO of Aurania, in February 2017.  A legal opinion 
from Aurania's Quito-based legal counsel, on which the Author is depending, confirms that 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 2 - 

title to each of the exploration concessions constituting the Project is registered to 
EcuaSolidus and in good standing as of the Effective Date.  Concessions are granted for a 
25-year term renewable for 25 more years.  The concessions are currently in year 3 of the 
Initial Exploration phase as defined by Ecuador's Mining Law.  Starting in year 5, any 
concessions not relinquished at the end of year four enter a four-year Advanced Exploration 
phase.  The Economic Evaluation phase starts at the beginning of year nine and lasts for two 
years, extendable for an additional two years.  Parts of concessions can be relinquished 
throughout these phases.  On completion of the Economic Evaluation phase, the remaining 
concessions enter the Exploitation stage, at which time an exploitation contract is negotiated 
with the Ecuadorian government. 
 
Most of the Property lies within the 344,002 Ha Kutukú-Shaime Protected Forest area.  
Mineral exploration and mining activities may be undertaken in this protected forest under 
basically the same permitting regime with the most significant exception being the number of 
drill pads for scout drilling being limited to 20 per concession, as opposed to 30 per 
concession outside of protected forests.  Drill pads within protected forest areas are required 
to be a maximum of 6 m by 6 m, while those outside of forest areas have a maximum limit of 
7 m by 7 m.  There is no limit on the number of bore holes that can be drilled from each drill 
pad.  Additionally, within a Protected Forest, consultation with landowners is mandated.  In 
practice this is no different from permitting outside a Protected Forest as Aurania will not 
conduct exploration activities without the permission of landowners.  As of the Effective 
Date, Aurania is compliant with the permitting process.  Aurania has reached formal access 
agreements with multiple indigenous communities and carried out early stage exploration 
activities including an initial drill program on two target areas.   
 
The Project carries a 2% net smelter return ("NSR") payable to Dr. Keith Barron and an 
additional 3-8% NSR payable to the government of  Ecuador;  the NSR rate is determined by 
terms negotiated in a mining contract signed with the government at the completion of the 
Economic Evaluation stage. 
 
1.3  ACCESS, CLIMATE, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

Access to the city of Macas, Aurania's exploration office, and the project, from Quito is 
excellent on 375 kilometres ("km") of well-maintained highways.  Access along the western 
and southern margins of the Project is also excellent via Highway 45 following the Upano 
River Valley through a series of large towns, and via the paved road (Highway 40) between 
Patuca and Santiago, respectively.  Access into the interior of the Property is poor, requiring 
travel by foot on forest paths from roads on the west and south sides of the Property or from 
landing strips for light aircraft on the east side of the Property.  Within the densely forested 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 3 - 

cordillera the topography is rugged with deeply incised valleys with elevations ranging from 
280 m to 2,480 m. 
 
The Project, which lies at the transition from the Andes to the Amazon Basin, receives 2-3 m 
of rainfall annually, supporting dense tropical vegetation.  Year-round temperatures in the 
town of Macas, where Aurania's field office is located on the northwestern margin of the 
Property, average 17°-24°C.   
 
1.4  HISTORY 

There has been no significant mining or modern exploration in the Cordillera de Cutucú.  
Aurania's interest in the area comes in part from similarities in the geology of the area with 
that of the well-mineralized Cordillera del Cóndor to the south, and in part, from archival 
research documenting a history of gold exploitation in the area during Spanish Colonial times. 

 
1.5  GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 

Ecuador lies above the subducting Nazca Plate, a tectonic setting typical of the Andes.  This is 
a setting proven to host porphyry, skarn, iron oxide copper gold ("IOCG"), fissure-manto, 
volcanogenic massive sulphide ("VMS"), carbonate replacement ("CRD") and epithermal 
precious metals deposits of Jurassic to Tertiary age.  Regionally, the Cordillera de Cutucú is 
part of the Sub-Andean Zone, a thrust fault bounded terrane separating the high Andes from 
the 200 km wide, hydrocarbon rich, Oriente Basin.   
 
Owing to lack of access and dense vegetation, the Cordillera de Cutucú geology is largely 
based on satellite image interpretation supported by limited fieldwork.  The geological map 
shows a setting dominated by north-northeast and north-northwest - trending thrust faults 
related to the Sub-Andean Thrust system and the Sub-Andean Front to the east.  Between 
these range bounding structures, Triassic to Jurassic sedimentary rocks are believed to make 
up most of the outcrop area of the Cordillera de Cutucú.  Within the Cordillera there appears 
to be limited outcrop of intrusive rocks, but airborne magnetic data indicate that several 
batholithic scale bodies are present at depth. 
 
The bulk of the Cordillera de Cutucú is underlain by the Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic 
Santiago Formation, composed dominantly of marine sedimentary and volcanic sequences 
and Mid- to Late- Jurassic rift fill sedimentary and volcanic strata of the Chapiza Formation.  
Applying the relationships observed in the Cordillera del Cóndor to the south, these are the 
formations most likely to host porphyry copper or epithermal precious metal deposits in the 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 4 - 

Project area.  The Santiago Formation comprises 1,000 to 2,700 m of dark limestones, 
calcareous sandstones, intercalations of bituminous shale and locally extensive andesitic to 
basaltic volcanic rocks.  The overlying Chapiza Formation is up to 4,500 m thick in the 
adjacent Oriente Basin.  The lower part of the Formation has an evaporite sequence which is 
overlain by a sequence of red-bed sandstones and conglomerates.  This is capped by up to 
3,000 m of interbedded volcanoclastics and lesser sedimentary intervals of the Misahualli 
Member, a unit that covers the Fruta del Norte gold deposit in the adjacent Cordillera del 
Cóndor. 
 
There are no significant known mineral deposits in the Cordillera de Cutucú.  However, 
Aurania's work, covering approximately 50% of the Property through the Effective Date, has 
identified multiple areas with potentially economic values in hand samples of copper, lead, 
zinc, and silver.  The silver-lead-zinc anomalies appear compatible with Mississippi Valley 
("MVT"), Irish-type, or carbonate replacement deposits ("CRD").  The copper anomalies 
appear mostly related to sedimentary-hosted copper (copper-silver) - type deposits with 
copper in soil potentially related to porphyry systems and a single anomaly potentially related 
to an IOCG system.  Epithermal gold has been a primary target model for Aurania and while 
work to date has identified multiple large areas with anomalies in epithermal pathfinder 
elements, such as arsenic, antimony, thallium and mercury, accompanying gold and silver 
values have been relatively low.   
 
1.6  DEPOSIT TYPES 

While there are no known significant metal deposits within the Project area, there is potential 
for multiple types of precious and base metal deposits.  This is based on interpretations of 
airborne magnetic and radiometric data, the rapidly expanding database of stream sediment, 
soil, and rock chip sampling, geological mapping and comparisons to geology in the adjacent, 
more intensely explored and well mineralized Cordillera del Cóndor.   
  
The primary target types considered when Aurania acquired the Project were high-grade 
epithermal vein or bulk tonnage precious metal deposits, gold skarns, and porphyry copper-
gold deposits.  Those deposit types and their variants remain viable targets, however, the 
strongest mineralization found in outcrop or float is sedimentary-hosted base metal 
mineralization.  The most prominent and extensive is sedimentary copper-silver followed by 
silver-lead-zinc manto-type (MVT, Irish, or CRD) replacement deposits.

1.7  EXPLORATION 

Aurania began exploration of the Property with a 5,714 line-kilometre airborne geophysical 
survey covering the entire Property and adjacent area combined with interpretation of satellite 
imagery to provide a clear framework of the structure and geology of the Cordillera de 
Cutucú.  Field work then focused on building a geochemical database starting with widely 
spaced stream sediment sampling throughout this cordillera.  As of the Effective Date, 
approximately 50% of the Property had been stream sediment sampled with results returned.  
Aurania continues with expanding stream sediment sample coverage while also following-up 
anomalies identified through the aforementioned exploration programs.  The follow-up work 
has consisted of prospecting and rock chip sampling and soil sampling along ridges and on 
detailed grids.  Geologists and prospectors accompanying the sampling teams map geology 
and collect rock chip samples.  Lastly, an initial diamond core drilling program was 
completed on the road-accessible Crunchy Hill epithermal prospect and a similar scout 
drilling program is currently underway in the Yawi target area. 
 
Through the Effective Date, Aurania has received analytical results for 2,816 stream sediment 
samples, 67 pan concentrate samples, 8,209 soil samples, and 1,543 rock chip samples.  The 
Author considers that Aurania's sample collection protocols are well-designed and effective 
for mineral exploration (see Chapter 11 for details).   
 
The exploration program, through the above referenced geophysical and geochemical surveys, 
has delineated multiple large target areas potentially related to multiple types of precious and 
base metal mineralization.   
 
Stream sediment sampling that has been completed over approximately 50% of the Project by 
the Effective Date, has resulted in Aurania identifying the following targets: 
 
• Three silver-arsenic-antimony-mercury-thallium-zinc anomalies each covering 50-

200 km² (Latorre, Apai and Tiria).  These anomalies appear to be related to extensive 
epithermal alteration systems, each containing multiple specific target areas.  No coherent 
gold anomaly has yet been identified within the Latorre area, a feature suspected to be due 
to the level of erosion being above any gold zone that may be associated with the 
epithermal system there.  Soil sampling from Tiria has partially defined a low level 
(5-11 ppb gold) but coherent gold anomaly requiring further sampling, while pan 
concentrate samples at Apai are starting to refine the target there; 

• Porphyry copper targets have been identified in the general Kirus, Jempe, Tsenken and 
Awacha areas.  Each of these broad areas host a cluster of discrete targets.  Awacha, is 
characterized by an area of quartz-sericite-pyrite ("QSP") alteration, confirmed with short 
wavelength infrared ("SWIR") spectral analysis, in clastic sedimentary rocks that extends 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 6 - 

over two clusters of distinct magnetic features each of which could be a target.  The broad 
Tsenken target area is resolving into multiple target areas, the most advanced of which 
Aurania terms Tsenken N2 and Tsenken N3.  Both are characterized by discrete magnetic 
centres and the Tsenken N2 target has a coincident copper in soil anomaly with scattered 
outcrops of QSP alteration.  No clear porphyry style mineralization, complete with 
stockwork veining, has yet been found in outcrop in these target areas, and finding such 
mineralization is a focus of ongoing fieldwork.  Brett (2019) identified 64 magnetic 
features within the Project area that could represent porphyry targets.  Of those, he 
classified 31 as high priority for follow-up;   

• The clearest anomalies, with multiple, high-grade values in copper and silver returned 
from rock chip sampling, are related with sedimentary-hosted mineralization that has been 
found over a total distance of 23 km;  

• Carbonate replacement silver-zinc-lead mineralization, with potentially economic values 
in lead and zinc, has been found over an area 12 km long; and,  

• There is growing evidence of IOCG-style copper-silver mineralization in the broader 
Tsenken target area.  Field relationships show that, as with some of the porphyry targets, 
such as Tsenken N2 and N3, gabbroic diorite that exhibits IOCG-type alteration, intrudes 
red-beds of the Mid-Jurassic Chapiza Formation. 

 
1.8  DRILLING 

Aurania completed a 9-hole, 3,204 m core drilling program on the Crunchy Hill target 
between March 3 and May 8, 2019.  The program failed to encounter significant values in 
either silver or gold.  However, vein composition, style and pathfinder element anomalies in 
the core, suggest that the precious metal zone of an epithermal system would lie 
approximately 500 m beneath the crest of Crunchy Hill, at an altitude of approximately 500 m 
to 600 m above mean sea level ("amsl"). 
 
A second scout drilling program was initiated on the Yawi target area starting with 1,870 m 
drilled in four holes completed as of the Effective Date.  Aurania has not reported analyses 
from that partially completed program.   
 
1.9  SAMPLE PREPARATION AND QA/QC  

Stream sediment, soil, and rock chip samples collected through 2017 and 2018 were prepared 
at ALS Global in Quito with pulps shipped and analysed at ALS' laboratory in Lima, Peru.  
Starting in 2019 samples, including the drill core from Crunchy Hill, have been prepared by 
an MSALABS affiliate in Cuenca with pulps shipped to the MSALABS laboratory in 
Vancouver for analysis.  Both ALS Global and MSALABS are among the industry leaders in 
preparing and analysing exploration samples.   



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 7 - 

Aurania's quality assurance/quality control ("QA/QC") protocols for collecting, preparing and 
analysing rock, soil, stream sediment, and drill core samples are more than adequate for an 
early stage exploration program.  Aurania's protocols, which are described in Chapter 11, call 
for inserting geochemical reference material, geochemically barren material, and duplicate 
samples, at regular intervals such that sample batches have at least two control samples.  In 
the Author's opinion, the geochemical data collected by Aurania may be relied upon. 
 
1.10  DATA VERIFICATION 

Review of Aurania's geochemical database for stream sediment, soil, and rock chip samples 
shows a well-organized Excel Workbook.  A comparison of gold, silver, copper, lead, and 
zinc results contained in 29 Certified Certificates from ALS and MSALABS, and representing 
several thousand samples, to the values for the same samples in Aurania's database, showed 
no errors.  A review of the drill hole database and logs shows them to be robust and reliable.   
 
The Author and Mr. Phillips, under the guidance of the Author, supervised the collection of 
11 samples in an effort to closely match as possible samples collected previously by Aurania 
and confirm those results.  These included a single stream sample, 5 core samples from 5 
holes at Crunchy Hill, and 5 rock chip samples from the Tsenken sedimentary-hosted copper 
target.  The results for gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc from all WGM's samples match 
within an acceptable range the values from the comparable samples collected by Aurania.  
Drill collar coordinates for four holes at Crunchy Hill taken by Mr. Page with a handheld GPS 
unit also matched well with the coordinates in the database.  In all aspects Aurania's drill core 
data collection protocols go beyond what is necessary for an early-stage drill program.   
 
As noted, the Author was unable to visit most of the target areas discussed in this Report and 
thus are unable to verify sample locations and exposed mineralization.  The conclusions 
provided in this Report are made under the assumption that Aurania's field personnel have 
accurately reported sample locations and adequately reported their geological context.

1.11  ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL 

Aurania is unaware of any pre-existing environmental liabilities on the Property, and, based 
on the lack of a mining history on the Property, that assessment is fair.  The Project lies within 
the Kutukú-Shaime Protected Forest in which exploration and production is allowed under 
slightly more stringent environmental parameters.  For example, scout drilling is allowed 
from 20 drill pads per concession during Initial Exploration, as opposed to 30 drill pads per 
concession outside of protected forest areas.  Permits for use of water for drilling are required 
on a prospect by prospect basis with permits received for the Crunchy Hill and Yawi 
target areas. 
 
In addition to governmental permitting, surface use and access rights are negotiated with the 
local communities.  Social engagement is critical to the future of the Project and Aurania has 
dedicated substantial effort, time and resources to community relations.  Formal access 
agreements have been negotiated and signed with 70% of the 56 communities that lie within 
the Project area.  In addition to providing employment opportunities to indigenous 
communities, special effort has been directed at working with governmental agencies to 
improve health, sanitation and education within the Project area.   
 
1.12  CONCLUSIONS 

Aurania's approach to exploring the Cordillera de Cutucú is sound, progressing from an 
airborne magnetic and radiometric geophysical survey and stream sediment sampling to 
highlight anomalous areas, and following up on the identified targets with detailed soil 
sampling, prospecting, and geological mapping prior to selecting initial drill targets.  If any 
significant precious or base metal deposit outcrops on the Property, Aurania's program should 
identify it. 
 
Aurania's program has yet to rediscover one of the gold deposits, dating to Spanish Colonial 
times, that originally was the driving concept behind the Project.  With nearly half the 
Property yet to be covered by the stream sediment sampling program, these "lost" deposits 
may yet be found.  While an outcropping precious metal deposit has so far eluded Aurania, its 
geochemical sampling program has outlined at least three, large (50 km² plus) areas with 
elevated arsenic, mercury, antimony and thallium values typical of trace element anomalies 
found above epithermal precious metal deposits.   
 
In addition, Aurania's airborne magnetic survey highlighted multiple magnetic features with 
the size and characteristics of porphyry copper - style alteration and mineralization systems.  
Follow-up exploration identified QSP alteration potentially related to underlying porphyries 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019

in the Awacha and Tsenken N2 target areas.  However, by the Effective Date, neither the 
geochemical sampling program nor prospecting had encountered definitive porphyry copper 
mineralization in classic quartz-stockwork veins.  Mapping and sampling on part of the 
Tsenken anomaly shows features typical of IOCG deposits.  As with epithermal gold, an 
outcropping porphyry deposit may yet be identified as stream sediment sampling coverage 
extends across the entirety of the Property.  Until one is found, Aurania's exploration for 
epithermal gold or porphyry copper and gold will be based on exploration models in which 
ore-grade mineralization is blind to surface. 
 
While the search for epithermal gold and porphyry copper deposits has yet to deliver strong 
gold or copper mineralized outcrops of either type, Aurania's work has identified large areas 
with high-grade copper, silver, zinc and lead in outcrop or float.  The high-grade copper 
samples are typical of sedimentary-hosted copper deposits and the high-grade zinc-lead 
samples are of carbonate replacement type.  Of these, the sedimentary-hosted copper potential 
appears the most attractive.  Anomalous copper mineralization, now encountered in multiple 
reduced layers in Chapiza Formation red-beds, extends for 23 km on strike.  Rock chip 
sampling within this trend has returned multiple samples with high-grade values in copper 
and silver. 
  
1.13  RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROPOSED EXPENDITURES 
 

The Author sees Aurania's highest priority as completing the stream sediment sampling 
program across the Property to determine if there are any outcropping epithermal gold and 
copper-gold or copper porphyry deposits on the Property. The second highest priority should 
be the continuation of the community relations program which has achieved support for the 
Project in the towns in the Upano River Valley and, most importantly, support from the large 
number of indigenous Shuar communities within the Cordillera de Cutucú.  Without this 
effort, gaining access to explore the full Project area, or to develop a mine, should a deposit 
be discovered, is likely to be more challenging.    
 
All additional work on the Project will flow from interpretation of the results of the Property-
wide airborne geophysics survey and the stream sediment geochemical survey.  If additional  
alteration-mineralization systems of significant scale are identified by the regional targeting 
effort, they, along with those target areas covered in this Report, should be prioritized on the 
basis of commodity, strength of the associated geochemical or geophysical anomaly, the 
expected deposit model-type, depth to target, access, and strength of community support for 
that target.   
 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 10 - 

Given the large size of the Property and the large number of targets identified, with additional 
targets expected from the completion of the stream sediment sampling program, Aurania 
should consider partnering with other entities to help fund exploration of some of the target 
areas.  Involving one or more partners should help in advancing the program more rapidly to 
ensure all concessions of potential interest remain in good standing.  Additionally, the more 
rapidly the program advances, the sooner Aurania will be able to reduce the size of the land 
package and reduce holding costs.  With all concessions in year 3 of the four-year Initial 
Exploration phase, Aurania is required to relinquish part of each concession – although the 
mining law does not stipulate the minimum area that should be relinquished from each 
concession.  The reduced concession clusters would advance to the next four-year stage of 
Advanced Exploration.   
 
The Author has reviewed Aurania's proposed exploration program and budget of 
C$9,000,000 and views both as reasonable and warranted given the scale of the Property and 
the multiple target areas to be advanced in the timeframes indicated above.

2.  INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
2.1  INTRODUCTION 

This Technical Report (the "Report") has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines of 
National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") covering Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 
Projects, Form 43-101F1 and Companion Policy 43-101CP of the Canadian Securities 
Administrators.  The Report was prepared for Aurania Resources Ltd.  ("Aurania") by Watts, 
Griffis and McOuat Limited ("WGM") Senior Associate Geologist, Robert Page, Ph.D., 
P.Geo., ("the Author").  Site visits to Ecuador were carried out by Mr. Page, and 
Robert Phillips an Associate Geologist with WGM.  Mr. Page is a Qualified Person ("QP") 
accredited as a member in good standing of the Professional Geoscientists of Ontario 
("PGO").  The Author and Mr. Phillips are independent of Aurania. 
 
2.2  TERMS OF REFERENCE 

Aurania requested that WGM prepare a NI 43-101 report ("the Report") on the Lost Cities – 
Cutucú Project ("the Project").  The Report updates the previous NI 43-101 report titled: 
NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Lost Cities – Cutucú Exploration Project, Province of 
Morona-Santiago, Ecuador, by Karl John Roa (2017) and having an effective date of 
April 23, 2017.  That report was prepared prior to any significant exploration work being done 
on the Property.  However, sections of that report covering location, climate, infrastructure, 
history, and regional geological setting are unchanged and the reader is referred to that report 
for more extensive narrative on those sections.   
 
Since April 2017, Aurania has carried out an exploration program that has incorporated 
geology, geochemistry, geophysics, limited drilling, environmental permitting and community 
relations.  To the knowledge of the Author, these are the first modern exploration activities 
carried out in the Cordillera de Cutucú.  The Report covers the results of Aurania's 
exploration and makes recommendations for additional work and an associated budget needed 
to carry out that work. 
 
2.3  SOURCES OF INFORMATION 

Reports, personal communications, and data generated by Aurania and EcuaSolidus, the 
wholly owned Ecuadorian subsidiary of Aurania, its geologists and its contractors since 
April 2017, are the primary sources of information in this Report.  The Author and 
Mr. Phillips were unable to visit most of the target areas covered in this Report and the 
Author relies on reporting from Aurania technical staff for most of Section 9.5.  The legal 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019

description of the concessions controlled by Aurania ("the Property"), its current legal status, 
and discussion of Ecuadorian mining law, have been provided by the Quito-based law firm of 
TOBAR ZVS SPINGARN, Aurania's Ecuadorian counsel.  As noted in Section 2.2, Roa 
(2017) has been relied upon for those sections of the Report where no new information has 
been generated since April 2017.   
 
2.4  DETAILS OF PERSONAL INSPECTION OF THE PROPERTY 

Mr. Page and Mr. Phillips spent a total of 16 days reviewing the Project as follows:  
 
Robert Page spent 3.5 days at Aurania's field office in Macas, Ecuador, arriving on the 
afternoon of August 25, 2019.  He spent a half day reviewing and sampling drill core and 
spent a full day in the field at the Crunchy Hill target area.  Access to target areas discussed in 
this Report can take several days owing to lack of roads and the need to traverse mountainous 
jungle trails.  Visiting more than the road accessible Crunchy Hill target was logistically 
beyond the scope of Robert Page's visit, who was thus dependant on review of hand samples 
collected by Aurania's field crews from the various target areas.  Additionally, Robert Page 
met with Aurania's legal counsel to review property title and Ecuadorian mining law. 
 
Mr. Phillips arrived in Macas on November 21, 2019 and spent 3 days fly-camping in the 
Awacha target area and 4 days in the Tsenken sedimentary-copper hosted target area.  He 
spent a further 4 days in Aurania's field office at Macas.   
 
Additionally, each of Mr. Page and Mr. Phillips, on their return to Quito from the Project, 
delivered the duplicate samples they collected to Bureau Veritas ("BV") for preparation and 
onward shipment to Vancouver for assay.   
 
Aurania's field protocols for collection and documentation of samples are thorough and the 
sample locations are well defined.  However, the inability to field check sample locations for 
geological context, and to gain better appreciation of logistical challenges, has meant that 
Section 9 on Exploration Results and Interpretation has been largely based on discussions and 
correspondence with Aurania geologists.   
 
2.5  UNITS AND CURRENCY 
 
All units of weights and measures are metric.  All currency amounts are given in United 
States dollars ("US$") unless otherwise specified.  Currency amounts in Canadian dollars are 
denoted by "C$".

4.  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
 
4.1  LOCATION 

The Project is serviced by Aurania's field office in the town of Macas, population ~30,000, 
located 250 km by air, and 375 km by road, from the capital city of Quito and 360 km by road 
from Guayaquil, Ecuador's main seaport (Figure 1).  Macas lies west of, and adjacent to the 
northwest end of the Property in the Rio Upano valley.  The nearest large city is Cuenca, 
population ~330,000, 120 km west-southwest of Macas.   
 
4.2  ECUADORIAN MINING LAW 

Ecuador's mining law was ratified in 2009 and amended in 2013, 2015 and 2018.  The 
principal components are summarized below from Zumárraga and Bustamante (2013), 
Wacaster (2015) and Zumarraga & Larrea (2019).   
 
All mineral and non-renewable resources are owned by the Ecuadorian State, which has the 
constitutional right to delegate exploration for, and extraction of, non-renewable resources, to 
third parties through the granting of mineral concessions.  The granting of a mineral 
concession confers to the concession holder the exclusive right to explore, exploit, process 
and sell any metallic mineral that lies within the concession.  The law allows for transfer of 
ownership of mineral concessions with the authorization of the Ministry of Energy and Non-
Renewable Natural Resources ("MENRNR").  Mineral concessions are administered by the 
Mining Regulation and Control Agency ("ARCOM") under MENRNR.   
 
The mining law distinguishes between small-scale operations processing up to 300 metric 
tons per day ("tpd"), medium-scale (up to 1,000 tpd underground, or 2,000 tpd from an open 
pit, or 3,000 tpd from an alluvial operation) and large-scale mining operations.  Small scale 
operations are subject to a 3% NSR payable to the State, while medium-scale operations 
attract an NSR of 4%.  The royalty for a large-scale producer is negotiated between 3% and 
8%.  The Constitution stipulates that, of the NSR payable to the State, an amount equal to a 
60% of the NSR due to the State will be paid to the communities within the area of interest of 
an operating mine.

4.2.1  MINERAL CONCESSIONS IN ECUADOR 
 
The MENRNR closed the mineral concession application system in January 2018 for 
administrative purposes and it is expected to reopen in the second quarter of 2020.  Prior to 
granting a mineral concession, the MENRNR determines if the area applied for is indeed open 
for staking.  The Ecuadorian Constitution bans all types of metal mining in protected areas, 
urban centres and national parks.   
 
4.2.1.1  Application Process  
 
Application for a pre-existing mineral concession that has expired, and has reverted to the 
State, is made through public auction.  Mineral concession applications are made online 
through a portal administered by ARCOM.  A large-scale concession has a minimum size of 
500 Ha and a maximum of 5,000 Ha with its corner points defined in UTM coordinates and 
boundaries orientated north-south and east-west.  Applicants must demonstrate their economic 
and technical capacity to advance mineral concessions.   
 
Once the corner co-ordinates of a mineral concession have been submitted online, the mineral 
concession application is transmitted to MENRNR, which has 3 business days to check that 
the application meets all requirements and that the applicant has been properly pre-authorized.  
The applicant stipulates the exploration expenditure that it will make during the first four 
years and this information remains sealed and confidential.  MENRNR then posts details of 
the concession application in its portal, and qualified parties have 5 business days to lodge 
competing bids.   
 
The competing bids are opened by MENRNR in the presence of the applicants and the 
committed expenditures from each bid announced.  If the competing bid is less than that of 
the original bid, the original bid wins the mineral concession.  If the competing bid is greater 
than the original bid but less than twice the bid made by the original applicant, the original 
applicant has the right to match the competing bid.  If the competing bid's expenditure 
commitment is more than twice that of the original applicant's, the competing bid wins.

4.2.1.2  Term 
 
Mineral concessions are granted for a term of 25 years, renewable for a further 25 years.  The 
term of a mineral concession is subdivided as follows: 

• Initial Exploration: Reconnaissance-stage mineral exploration can be conducted for 
a maximum of four years.  Scout drilling is allowed under Initial Exploration from a 
maximum of 30 drill platforms per concession except in protected forests where 
a maximum of 20 platforms are allowed.  Once the Initial Exploration phase has been 
completed, and prior to initiation of the Advanced Exploration phase, at least 1 Ha of each 
concession must be relinquished; 

• Advanced Exploration: Application can be made at any time within the Initial Exploration 
phase for a change to Advanced Exploration.  Otherwise, Advanced Exploration starts after 
termination of the four-year Initial Exploration period.  The Advanced Exploration phase is 
for a maximum of four years.  The intention of this phase is that intense drilling, and 
potentially resource delineation, is undertaken;  

• Economic Evaluation: this is a two-year period, extendable for an additional two years.  
During the economic evaluation phase, the concession-holder is required to apply for the 
commencement of the Exploitation phase of the project; and 

• Exploitation: Within six months of beginning the Exploitation Phase, the concession-
holder is required to sign a mining exploitation contract with the Ecuadorian government.  
Negotiations regarding that contract may begin during the economic evaluation phase.  The 
exploitation contract stipulates the financial terms governing production, the NSR payable 
and various tax-related matters. 

 

4.2.1.3  Annual Fees 
 
An annual exploration concession fee per hectare must be paid to the State by March 31st each 
year to maintain a concession in good standing.  The fee is based on a percentage of the 
minimum wage that is set by the State, and hence fluctuates from year to year.  The annual fee 
is approximately US$10 per Ha. 
 
4.2.1.4  Annual Exploration Expenditure 
 
Under the terms of an exploration license, the title holder is required to make minimum 
annual exploration expenditures as follows: 
 
• Year 1: US$5 per Ha; 
• Year 2: US$5 per Ha; 
• Year 3: US$10 per Ha; and, 
• Year 4: US$10 per Ha. 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 18 - 

The annual fees covered above can be applied towards the annual expenditure requirement on 
each concession.  The annual expenditure report on each concession must be filed with the 
MENRNR by March 31st of the year after the expenditures were incurred. 
 
4.2.1.5  Annual Technical and Financial Reports 
 
A report on exploration undertaken, results obtained, and expenditures incurred, must be filed 
for each concession annually by March 31st of the year after the exploration was done.  The 
report is required to include the work program and budget for the subsequent year. 
 
4.2.1.6  Marking of Exploration Concession Boundaries 
 
Mineral resource concessions are applied through map-staking.  However, after a concession 
area is granted, the mining law requires that beacons be placed at the corner points of all 
concessions.  Aurania has marked corner points with concrete-filled 5 cm diameter PVC pipes 
marked with the concession name and the UTM coordinates (Figure 2).

4.2.1.7  Non-Compliance 
 
Concessions can be cancelled for failure to file an annual report, failure to pay the annual fee, 
misrepresenting the stage of the licenses' development, excessive environmental impact, 
irreparable damage to Ecuadorian cultural heritage, or violation of human rights.   
 
4.2.2  SURFACE RIGHTS 
 
Ownership of surface rights and underlying mineral rights are separate under Ecuadorian law.  
The concession holder must secure easements for access, for the construction of camps and 
for exploration infrastructure to allow evaluation of mineral concessions.  Should easements 
not be forthcoming from the landowner, the law provides for the State to intervene to 
negotiate rights of way.  The timeframes of such easements are concurrent with those of the 
associated mineral concession.  Surface rights over the approximately 69% of the Cordillera 
de Cutucú belong to communities of the indigenous Shuar People.  Approximately 5% of 
surface rights are owned by non-Indigenous people and 26% of the area is State Land 
administered by the Ministry of the Environment.   
 
4.3  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 

EcuaSolidus applied for 86 mineral exploration concessions covering 424,833 Ha on 
March 1, 2016.  The then Ministry of Mines accepted applications for 42 concessions 
(Figure 3 and Table 1), and since there were no competing bids, the concessions were granted 
on December 27 and 28, 2016.  The remaining 44 applications were "reserved" to be granted 
to EcuaSolidus at a later date but were subsequently eliminated from the cadaster (see 
Section 4.3.5 below). 
 
The Lost Cities – Cutucú Project lies in the Cordillera de Cutucú in southeastern Ecuador.  
The Property extends 90 km north-south and up to 45 km east-west between grid lines 
803,100mE to 853,900mE, and 9,755,500mN to 9,665,300mN in UTM zone 17S Provisional 
South American Datum ("PSAD") 56.  The centre of the Property is 828,479mE and 
9,710,415mN (Zone 17S), corresponding with latitudes -2°37'11"S and -78°2'55"W 
(Figure 3).  The Property covers 207,764 Ha or 2,077.64 km2.

4.4  MINERAL CONCESSION STATUS AND COMPLIANCE 

A legal opinion, on which the Author is depending (Section 3), confirms that title to each of 
the exploration concessions constituting the Project is registered to EcuaSolidus, and in good 
standing as of the Effective Date.  EcuaSolidus registered the 42 concessions constituting the 
Property between February 9 and 16, 2017.  The registration process was as follows: 
 
• On receipt of title to each concession from the MENRNR, the title was notarized; 
• Each notarized document was then registered with ARCOM; and 
• Proof of registration with ARCOM was lodged with the regional sub-secretariat of mining.  

The Properties fall under the jurisdiction of the regional coordination in Macas - Morona 
Santiago. 

 
In a transaction dated February 27, 2017, EcuaSolidus was acquired by Aurania.   
 
As of the Effective Date, ARCOM's website shows the exploration concessions constituting 
the Project in good standing (https:// http://geo.controlminero.gob.ec:1026/geo_visor/).

Maintenance of the full 42-concession package through the Initial Exploration phase involved 
the following reporting and expenditure, with projections made for years 3 and 4:  

• Year 1 (ended December 2017 and Annual Reports presented to the Ecuadorian authorities 
by March 31, 2018): 

o Concession fees of US$1,973,198 (US$9.50/Ha) were paid by March 31, 2017; and 
o Expenditure on the concessions was required to have exceeded the larger of the 

US$5.00/Ha (US$1,038,820) stipulated by law or the US$1,060,000 committed by the 
Company.  In-country expenditure recorded in the annual reports presented to the 
Ecuadorian authorities for Year 1 was US$3,354,497; 

• Year 2 (ended December 2018 and Annual Reports presented to the Ecuadorian authorities 
by March 31, 2019): 

o Concession fees of US$2,004,923 (US$9.65/Ha) were paid by March 31, 2018; and 
o Expenditure on the concessions was required to have exceeded the larger of the 

US$5.00/Ha (US$1,038,820) stipulated by law or the US$1,090,000 committed by the 
Company.  The in-country expenditure recorded in the annual reports presented to the 
Ecuadorian authorities for Year 2 was US$4,396,820; 

• Year 3 (up to December 2019, and to be reported by March 31, 2020):  
o Concession fees of US$2,046,475 (US$9.85/Ha) which were paid prior to 

March 31, 2019; and 

o Expenditure on the concessions must exceed the larger of the US$10.00/Ha 
(US$2,077,640) required by law or the US$2,098,000 committed by the Company; 

• Year 4 (up to December 2020, and to reported by March 31, 2021): 
o Concession fees of approximately US$2,050,000 (US$9.87/Ha) to be paid by 

March 31, 2020; and 

o Expenditure on the concessions must exceed the larger of the US$10.00 
(US$2,077,640) required by law or a higher amount committed by the Company, and 
to be determined by March 31, 2020.  At the end of the first four years from the 
granting of the concessions, compliance with the amounts committed in the bidding 
process must be submitted. 

 
In Year 5 and beyond, the Company will be required to conduct Advanced Exploration on 
selected target areas and these expenditures cannot be estimated at this time.   
 
Of the 86 mineral concessions applied for on March 1, 2016, 42 were granted and 44 were 
assigned to be "reserved" for issuance to the Company at a later date.  On 
December 22, 2017, at the behest of the then Ministry of Mines, application was submitted for 
four of the reserved mineral concessions, totaling 19,800 Ha, that are contiguous with the 
Property.  These applications are under review by MENRNR and, if accepted, the concession 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 24 - 

applications will be gazetted and will go through the concession-granting process, with a 
possible Swiss Challenge (the process described in Section 4.2.1.1) if other parties submit 
competing tenders. 
 
In a letter dated January 31, 2018, the then Ministry of Mines informed EcuaSolidus that the 
remaining 39 reserved concessions had been cancelled.  On February 23, 2018, EcuaSolidus 
submitted a challenge regarding the reserved areas to the MENRNR.  This appeal has not 
been resolved.   
 
4.5  LEGAL ACCESS 

The majority of the Property lies within the 344,002 Ha Kutukú-Shaime Protected Forest area 
(CARE, 2012; Rivandeira Torres, 2012).  This Protected Forest was formally declared under 
official register No. 476 and ministerial resolution No. 402, dated July 3, 1990.   
 
Ecuador's Protected Forests are natural areas that can be comprised of public, private, and 
community-owned lands and were created to manage and protect river basins and forests.  
Mineral exploration and mining activities may be undertaken in protected forests under a 
more stringent permitting protocol for advanced-stage exploration activities.  Consultation 
with local stakeholders is required for exploration planned in protected forests and there is a 
risk that this consultation may delay access and delay some work programs. 
 
4.6  TAXES AND ROYALTIES 

4.6.1  ROYALTIES 
 
The definitive agreement between EcuaSolidus and Aurania stipulates that a 2% NSR on 
metals and a 2% net sales royalty on non-smelted products, such as aggregate for concrete, are 
payable to Dr Keith Barron from any production from the Property.   
 
A royalty is also payable to the State.  Ecuadorian Mining Law defines a sliding-scale of 
between 3% and 8%, from large-scale mineral and metal production.  Of this amount, the 
Constitution stipulates that an amount equal to a 60% of the NSR due to the State will be paid 
to the communities within the area of interest of an operating mine. 
 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 25 - 

4.6.2  TAXES 
 
Taxes applicable to exploitation of minerals and metals are as follows: 
 
• Income tax is 25% payable on income less expenses; 
• 3% of profit is payable to employees; 
• 12% of profit is to be paid to the State; 
• There is a 5% tax on funds sent abroad from mining operations; and 
• Value Added Tax ("VAT") stands at 12% on goods purchased and services rendered.  

Mineral and metal exporters recover VAT paid. 
 
A 10% reduction in income tax applies to the proportion of profits that are reinvested in 
production assets in Ecuador.  Further tax incentives are available for operations in 
economically depressed and/or frontier areas.

5.  ACCESS, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
 AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
5.1  ACCESS 

Until recently there was a commercial jet service between Macas and Quito, however, with a 
decline in oil exploration in the region those flights have been discontinued.  Access to Macas 
and the Project from Quito is now by chartered aircraft or by vehicle over 375 km mostly on 
the paved and well-maintained two-lane Highway 45.  Highway 45 continues to the south 
from Macas along the Rio Upano passing through multiple smaller towns and providing 
jumping off points to the interior of the western flank of the Cordillera de Cutucú.   
 
Another paved, two-way road, Highway 40, links the town of Patuca near the southwestern 
part of the Property to the town of Santiago, that lies to the southeast of the Property.  The 
Patuca-Santiago road provides easy access to the Crunchy Hill and Yawi target areas where 
scout drilling has been focused.  The Apai target, which has been prioritized for scout drilling, 
also lies near the Patuca-Santiago road.  All other access in the cordillera is by foot along 
crude trails.  On the east side of the cordillera access to jungle trails is via fixed-wing aircraft 
to jungle airstrips serving Shuar communities.  The lack of roads, difficult topography, and 
dense vegetation have been a deterrent to development in the Cordillera de Cutucú.   
 
5.2  CLIMATE 

The Project, which lies at the transition from the Andes to the Amazon Basin, receives high 
rainfall year-round supporting dense tropical vegetation.  Despite a location near the equator, 
the climate is temperate with temperature varying little, averaging 17°C to 24°C, on a daily or 
seasonal basis in Macas.  Annual rainfall in Macas is just under 2.6 m (Figure 4) and is higher 
within most of the Cordillera de Cutucú.

(Source: https:/en.climate-data.org) 

Figure 4.  Annual rainfall and temperature variations in the communities of Macas and  
the slightly lower elevation, Sucua  

 
 
Though it rains all year, from March through July the monthly averages exceed 250 mm per 
month and averages less than 200 mm per month the rest of the year with the lowest rainfall 
in December.  Lower rainfall occurs in areas of lower elevation.  Field activities are 
conducted year-round but can be interrupted for hours due to thunderstorms or days due to 
high water in rivers that access paths cross.   
 
5.3  LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

Access and infrastructure in the Rio Upano valley is good.  Highway 45, a major two-lane 
asphalt highway, follows the Upano Valley connecting Macas, Sucua, and Patuca along with 
several smaller towns and provides access to the west side of the Property.  There are farms, 
ranches, hospitals, schools, government offices, military bases, public transportation, and 
paved runways in Macas and Patuca.  There is no shortage of human resources in the area and 
various services are available for support of an exploration project.   
 
Further from Highway 45, and particularly on the east flank of the Cordillera de Cutucú, 
access is a challenge with the many small Shuar communities in the area connected to the 
larger centres by footpaths and jungle airstrips.  Public services within the remote 
communities are sparse to non-existent.  Agricultural activity is generally at the subsistence 
level. 
 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019

5.4  PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The Cordillera de Cutucú, along with the Cordillera del Cóndor which lies immediately to the 
south across the Rio Santiago, from the foothills of the Ecuadorian Andes and marks the 
western boundary of the Amazon Basin.  The Cordillera de Cutucú is separated from the main 
Andes range by the Rio Upano valley that averages 8 km wide.  The northern limit of the 
Cordillera de Cutucú is defined by the Rio Pastaza which flows southeast into the 
Amazon Basin.   
 
There are two elongate north-south ridge-lines along the crest of the Cordillera de Cutucú 
separated by the 80 km long Rio Nangosiza.  Elevations along the highlands of the cordillera 
range between 1,800 m and 2,480 m.  The valleys on either flank of the range vary from 
1,000 m elevation in the north to 280 m in the far southeast.   
 
The eastern flanks of the Cordillera de Cutucú rise abruptly from the Amazonian flatlands as a 
distinctive escarpment.  Within the cordillera the topography is rugged with deeply incised 
valleys.  Some of streams draining the mountain range cross limestones and disappear into 
underground waterways.  There are eight principal fluvial basins within the Project area, and 
all drain into the Amazon flatlands.  Dense jungle vegetation covers nearly the entire 
Cordillera.

6.  HISTORY 
 
 
Aurania's interest in the Project comes in part from similarities in geology to that of the 
Cordillera del Cóndor to the south which hosts major gold and copper deposits.  It also comes 
in part from research of documents in various archives in the Americas, Spain and the Vatican 
which record a history of some 35 years of gold exploitation from two mines from Spanish 
Colonial times that are believed to lie within the Project area.  The reader is referred to the 
Section 16.2 of Roa (2017), for an extensive review of Spanish exploration and mining 
activity from that period. 
 
In contrast to the Cordillera del Cóndor, there has been no modern mineral exploration in the 
Cordillera de Cutucú, and little mining activity since Spanish Colonial times.  The region east 
and north of the Project hosts the Oriente Basin which contains the third largest petroleum 
resources in South America after Venezuela and Brazil.

7.  GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
 
7.1  REGIONAL, LOCAL AND PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

The sections below covering Regional Geology and Local Geology, including the sections on 
stratigraphy, are largely condensed from the Roa (2017).  The reader is referred to that report 
for a more detailed discussion on the regional and local geological setting. 
 
7.1.1  REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
Ecuador lies above the actively subducting oceanic Nazca plate which controls the 
distribution of the 18 active volcanos.  These include the Sangay Volcano, 48 km northwest of 
the Property, which is active, with fumaroles, lava flows, ash clouds and pyroclastic flows and 
lahars forming on a daily basis.  Ecuadorian geology, between the Pacific Ocean and the 
Amazon basin, is dominated by a series of trench-parallel terranes composed of at least four 
Triassic to Tertiary age volcanic island arcs accreted onto South America (Figure 5).  This 
tectonic setting is typical of the setting all along the western continental margin of the 
Americas; a setting proven to host porphyry, skarn, manto, volcanogenic massive sulphide 
and epithermal precious metals deposits. 
 
The Cordillera de Cutucú forms part of the Sub-Andean Zone, a thrust fault-bounded terrane 
separating the high Andes from the 200 km wide Oriente Basin.  West-dipping thrust faults 
define both the western (Sub-Andean Thrust) and eastern boundaries (Sub-Andean Front) of 
the Sub-Andean Zone.  The Oriente Basin, host to major petroleum reservoirs, is a back-arc 
basin filled with thousands of metres of Mesozoic marine and continental sedimentary strata 
deposited on Paleozoic to Proterozoic metamorphic rocks of the Amazonian Craton.   
 
7.1.2  LOCAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
Owing to lack of access and dense vegetation the geological map of the Cordillera de Cutucú 
is based largely on private compilations from oil exploration programs in the adjacent Oriente 
Basin, and regional academic studies.  Compilation work done by Aurania, including detailed 
satellite imagery interpretations, has probably produced the best geological map of the 
Cordillera de Cutucú (Figure 6).

OUTLINE



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 33 - 

The map shows a tectonic setting dominated by north-northeast and north-northwest trending 
thrust faults related to the Sub-Andean Thrust system on the west and the Sub-Andean Front 
on the east, producing a series of inverted half grabens.  Triassic- to Jurassic- aged 
sedimentary rocks are believed to make up most of the outcrop area of the Cordillera de 
Cutucú.  Prospecting, mapping, and drilling of the Crunchy Hill target all indicate the geology 
will be significantly more complex than shown in Figure 6 including the presence of multiple 
intrusions.   
 
Intrusive bodies in the Cordillera de Cutucú, are less extensive in outcrop in comparison to 
the Cordillera del Cóndor to the south, where the Zamora Batholith is exposed over hundreds 
of square kilometres (Figure 7).  The difference is attributed by Aurania to a higher erosion 
level in the Cordillera de Cutucú relative to the Cordillera del Cóndor.  The aeromagnetic 
survey carried out by Aurania supports this conclusion by having provided strong evidence 
for batholith-scale intrusions at depth under the Cordillera de Cutucú.   
 
7.1.3  STRATIGRAPHY 
 
The oldest rocks in the Cordillera de Cutucú are in the Devonian Pumbuiza Formation, a 
sequence of shales, quartzites and conglomerates metamorphosed to greenschist facies, and in 
the 1,000 m thick Permian to Carboniferous Macuma Formation.  Both formations are limited 
in outcrop to the northern part of the cordillera.   
 
The bulk of the Cordillera de Cutucú is underlain by Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic 
Santiago Formation composed primarily of marine sedimentary and volcanic sequences and 
the Mid- to Late-Jurassic Chapiza Formation rift-fill sedimentary and volcanic sequences.  
These formations are the most likely to contain, respectively, precious metal epithermal and 
sedimentary-hosted copper deposits in the Project area (Figure 8). 
 
7.1.3.1  Santiago Formation 
 
The Santiago Formation is constituted by 1,000 m to 2,700 m of dark limestones, calcareous 
sandstones, intercalations of bituminous shale and locally volcanic rocks.  Santiago Formation 
volcanics include early rift-related continental tholeiitic basalts and later subduction-related, 
calc-alkaline lavas (Romeuf et al., 1995, Romeuf et al., 1997).

According to Gaibor et al. (2005), the Santiago Formation has three members:  
 
• The Santiago River Member with thick grey to black limestone and marl with lesser intra-

formational breccias; 
• The Yuquianza Member with black calcareous shale and lesser green siltstones; and 
• The Patuca Member with thick beds of grey, green and brown siltstones, greywacke and 

calcareous black shale interbedded with basaltic lavas. 
 
Patuca Member  
Detailed mapping and exploration drilling undertaken by Aurania in the area immediately east 
of Patuca revealed a more comprehensive stratigraphic and tectonic picture of the Patuca 
Member with two units as described below.   
 
San Simon Unit: The lower part of the Patuca Member consists of finely-laminated mudstone, 
limestone, siltstone and volcanoclastic sequences.  Many of these finer-grained strata contain 
traces of hydrocarbon.  Despite the prevalence of sedimentary rocks mapped at surface, 
drilling at Crunchy Hill cut a 500 m thick sequence of mafic volcanics, devoid of sedimentary 
intercalations.  These volcanic rocks have a magnesium oxide content of up to 9% and range 
from high-magnesium tholeiitic basalt, through basalt, andesite and dacite.  Texturally, these 
mafic volcanics are classified as hyaloclastites, implying subaqueous volcanic origin.  They 
are overlain by finely laminated siltstones or volcaniclastics intercalated with limestone units 
several metres thick.  Some of the limestone exhibits tepee structures indicative of 
desiccation. 
 
Puchimi Unit: A sequence more than 500 m thick of finely laminated black mudstone, with 
abundant ammonites, is overlain by thinly bedded green volcanoclastic rocks and lesser 
intermediate to mafic lavas.  Finely laminated siltstones and mudstones, with abundant plant 
fragments and minor proto-coal seams, overlie the volcanics.  The siltstones and mudstones in 
turn are overlain by cross-bedded sandstones and conglomerates.  This unit is abruptly 
overlain by black shales that have abundant ammonites. 
 
The volcanic components of the Santiago Formation have two distinctive magmatic affinities.  
The first has a continental tholeiitic basaltic affinity that accumulated during rifting.  The 
second suite of interleaved volcanic rocks consists of subduction-related, calc-alkaline lavas 
possibly corresponding to the first extrusives of the Mesozoic volcanic arc (Romeuf et al., 
1995, Romeuf et al., 1997).   
 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 37 - 

Elsewhere in the sub-Andean zone of Ecuador, the Triassic volcanic rocks of the Santiago 
Formation are designated as the Piuntza Unit (Litherhand et al., 1994), forming a sequence of 
continental/marine volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks.  The Piuntza Unit outcrops as enclaves 
of supra-crustal rocks within the Zamora Batholith, replete with intrusions (Drobe et al., 
2013), and is the principal host for skarn deposits in the Nambija mining district (Fontboté et 
al., 2004).  It has also recently been interpreted as the host for epithermal mineralization at the 
FDN gold-silver deposit (Leary et al., 2016).  The Piuntza Unit is also mapped immediately 
north of the Panantza porphyry copper deposit (Drobe, 2007). 
 
The Santiago Formation is truncated by an angular unconformity overlain variably by the 
Jurassic Chapiza Formation (the Misahuallí and Yaupi Members) or by the Cretaceous 
Hollín Formation.   
 
7.1.3.2  Chapiza Formation 
 
This Mid- to Late- Jurassic formation correlates regionally with the extensive Sarayaquillo 
Formation in Perú (Benavides, 1968; Gaibor et al., 2008) and the Girón Formation in 
Colombia (Tschopp, 1953).  Oil drilling approximately 40 km to the east of the Project shows 
the Chapiza Formation can be 4,500 m thick.  Evaporites make up the lower part of the 
formation and are the source for salt domes in the region. 
 
The evaporites are overlain by continental red-bed sandstones and conglomerates.  These in 
turn are overlain by a 1,000 to 3,000 m thick sequence termed the Misahualli Member 
(Tschopp, 1953).  It is composed of calc-alkaline rhyolitic to basaltic flows and volcanoclastic 
rocks interbedded with minor sedimentary layers.  The presence of the Misahualli Member in 
the Cordillera de Cutucú is significant as this unit overlies and conceals the Fruta Del Norte 
deposit in the Cordillera del Cóndor (Leary et al., 2016).   
 
7.1.3.3  Cretaceous Formations 
 
The youngest rocks of the Cordillera de Cutucú are Cretaceous-aged continental sedimentary 
units that transition upward into marine sediments up to 600 m thick divided into three 
formations: 
 
• Hollin Formation: white, cross bedded sandstones, 150 m thick with carbonaceous shale 

intercalations.  This formation hosts major oil-producing intervals in the Oriente Basin;  

• Napo Formation: a sequence of black, organic-rich mudstones, carbonaceous sandstones 
and limestones conformably overlying the Hollin Formation.  Volcanic rocks along a 
north-northeast trend parallel to the orientation of the Cordillera de Cutucú interrupt Napo 
Formation sedimentary strata; and 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 38 - 

• Tena Formation: up to 300 m of stacked red-beds interspersed with lesser conglomerates 
and mudstones unconformably overlying the Napo Formation.   

 
7.2  MINERALIZATION 

No significant mineral prospects were known from the Cordillera de Cutucú at the time 
Aurania acquired the Property.  Roa (2017) reported that three gold occurrences have been 
recorded in the Cordillera de Cutucú by FUNGEOMINE, a private company providing 
exploration and mining data to the minerals industry in Ecuador.  There is no information 
beyond the approximate location of these prospects.  One of these sites is Patuca, where gold 
is sluiced from gravel at an elevation approximately 400 m above the plain of the Upano 
River immediately adjacent to the southwestern corner of the Property.  Elsewhere, artisanal 
miners are reported to be locally extracting placer gold on a small scale in the Yaupi and 
Cushuimi streams that drain part of the Cordillera de Cutucú.

8.  DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
 
As noted in Section 7.2, no significant mineral deposits have yet been found in the Cordillera 
de Cutucú.  However, the Project does have potential to host various types of deposits 
carrying one or more of gold, silver, copper, molybdenum, lead, and zinc.  This is based on 
results from Aurania's work on the Property, and through comparisons with geology of the 
Cordillera del Cóndor - host to multiple epithermal precious metal, skarn and porphyry copper 
deposits.  Aurania's exploration efforts have shown the presence of clear geological and 
geochemical indicators potentially related to the deposit types described below except for the 
skarn and sedimentary-hosted gold types.  Indicators for these deposits could still be 
identified as field work extends across the approximately 50% of the Property for which 
stream sediment sampling remains to be completed, or which has been completed but for 
which analyses have not been received. 
 
8.1  EPITHERMAL PRECIOUS METAL DEPOSITS 

Epithermal gold-silver deposits develop in the relative near-surface environment through 
hydrothermal activity around intrusive centres in island arc, continental arc, and continental 
rift environments.  Based on multiple factors related to the type of magmatic activity, distance 
from the associated intrusion, depth to the water table, and nature of the host rocks, these 
systems have been classified along a spectrum between two end members – low sulphidation 
and high sulphidation.  The differences are related to the composition of the mineralizing 
fluids which produce quite different mineral and alteration assemblages.  What is important is 
that both types of epithermal systems, and those intermediate between the two have generated 
major gold-silver deposits around the world and particularly in the Andes. 
 
The footprint of individual deposits, whether as ore shoots along discrete underground 
mineable veins, or disseminated and fracture-controlled bulk tonnage deposits, tend to be 
small relative to the scale of the entire hydrothermal system.  In both low and high 
sulphidation cases the limits of the entire hydrothermal system may cover 50 km² to well over 
200 km².  The much smaller economically mineralized zones may be difficult to discover but 
the presence of the hydrothermal system is not.  At inception of the Project epithermal gold 
and porphyry copper were the highest priority target-types for Aurania.  Subsequent work, as 
outlined in Section 9, confirms the presence of at least three, large, low- and/or intermediate- 
sulphidation epithermal alteration systems though much work remains to demonstrate the 
presence of potentially economic mineralization.

8.1.1  LOW SULPHIDATION EPITHERMAL DEPOSITS 
 
This class of epithermal deposits is the most distal of intrusion related hydrothermal systems.  
Ore zones in these systems generally form within 1,000 m of surface and have a limited 
vertical extent with precious metal grades decreasing sharply below the depth at which rising 
hydrothermal fluids began to boil (Figure 9).  Below that level potentially economic 
mineralization becomes base metal dominated.  The surface expression of such low 
sulphidation hydrothermal systems are what we see today in hot springs such as those at 
Yellowstone, Montana or Rotorua, New Zealand.   
 
Low sulphidation epithermal deposits have ore assemblages dominated by a gangue of quartz, 
with accessory adularia and calcite, and a sulphide content dominated by pyrite or pyrrhotite 
with accessory galena, sphalerite and minor arsenopyrite.  The gold to silver ratio in these 
deposits may vary from 1:1 to 1:300 within a single district but, in general, each district will 
have an overall ratio that tends to hold over time as they are fully explored.

Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 41 - 

Economic mineralization in low sulphidation epithermal mining districts tend to be either in 
big underground mineable veins on major structures, which can be followed for kilometres, or 
as relatively lower grade dispersed mineralization either disseminated through the host rock or 
as a multitude of narrow veins developed along pervasive fracture systems.  In the case of 
vein-dominated systems, economic mineralization is confined to high-grade ore shoots with 
dimensions of a few 10's to 100's of metres along strike and 100's of metres down plunge.  
With vein widths generally less than 10 m thick, and with ore shoots having limited strike and 
dip extent, these targets require intense drilling.  The bulk tonnage targets are simpler to 
explore, but given the scale and lower grade, may be more problematic to permit for 
development.   
 
Mineralization of either type generally has a significant component of the gold as free gold or 
electrum.  Silver in the high silver to gold ratio systems occurs as argentite or is in galena and 
sulfosalts.  In most cases these assemblages are not refractory, making for relatively simple 
metallurgy.  Either type of system can produce giant deposits and are attractive targets.   
 
8.1.2  HIGH SULPHIDATION EPITHERMAL DEPOSITS 
 
This class of epithermal deposit forms above the causative intrusive complex in the area of 
highest heat flow (Figure 10), the most sulphur-rich hydrothermal environment around the 
intrusion.  Sulphur-bearing magmatic fluids mixing with oxidizing ground water become 
extremely acidic.  The acidic fluid reacts strongly with wall rocks, generally volcanic rocks, to 
produce a core of residual silica (or vuggy silica) in which all rock-forming minerals except 
silica have been dissolved, flanked by progressively higher pH mineral assemblages typically 
including quartz-alunite, kaolinite, illite and illite-smectite mixed layer clays respectively.  
The porous vuggy silica is a favorable host for subsequent gold mineralization.   
 
Mineralization of the high sulphidation type tends to replace the already intensely altered host 
rock in irregular zones around controlling structures instead of being restricted to large veins.  
Gold to silver ratios tend to be higher than with the low sulphidation deposits, and some 
deposits have significant accompanying copper mineralization, such as at Loma Larga, 
Ecuador.  The sulphide assemblage is pyrite-enargite dominant.  Unless mineralization of the 
high sulphidation type has been subjected to oxidation, the gold tends to be refractory, 
requiring higher grade to support more costly roasting, pressure oxidation, or direct smelting 
of arsenic-bearing concentrate.

8.2  SEDIMENTARY-HOSTED COPPER-SILVER  

Sedimentary-hosted copper deposits, including those characterized as red-bed type, were not 
among the deposit types under consideration by Aurania when exploration of the Project 
started.  However, exploration carried out since 2017 has documented the presence of red-bed 
type mineralization over at least 23 km of strike along the axis of the Property. 
 
Sedimentary-hosted copper deposits are second only to porphyry deposits in terms of global 
copper production.  Sedimentary-hosted copper deposits are also a significant source of silver.  
The biggest and highest-grade examples of this class of deposit are located in the famed 
Central African Copperbelt ("Copperbelt") of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Zambia.  A second major sediment hosted copper province is found in the Kupferschiefer 
strata of the Zechstein Basin of Germany and Poland.  The Copperbelt contained 
approximately 440 billion pounds ("Blbs") of copper (Hitzman et al., 2012) and the 
Kupferschiefer approximately 133 Blbs (Borg et al., 2012). 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 43 - 

Hitzman et al. (2010) document two periods in earth history, the Neo-Proterozoic and the 
Permian, when the "super giant" sedimentary copper provinces of Katanga and the 
Kupferschiefer developed.  These authors believe these to be the prime periods in Earth 
history for forming the largest deposits.  Lesser, but still significant, provinces formed during 
other periods in the Proterozoic (Udokan, Siberia and the Belt Basin of Idaho and Montana) 
and in the Mesozoic (Kazakhstan).  Although not of Neo-Proterozoic or Permian age, the 
favorable stratigraphy of the Triassic-Jurassic aged Chapiza Formation in the Cordillera de 
Cutucú has all the geological elements needed for development of the red-bed class of 
sedimentary-hosted copper deposits. 
 
The model for sedimentary-hosted copper deposits calls for: 
 
• Dewatering of a large basin of oxidized continental sandstones and conglomerates (red-

beds); 
• Evaporites to provide the brine needed to strip copper and silver from the sediments and 

possibly the sulphur ultimately needed to allow deposition of sulphides; 
• Reduced sedimentary strata (shale or organic-rich sandstone) at the top of the basin to 

convert sulphate in the copper-bearing brine to sulphide and precipitate copper sulphides; 
and 

• A structural setting that funnels the metal-rich brine to a deposition site where ore grade 
mineralization over widths of a metre to tens of metres can develop. 

 
The Chapiza Formation has all of these characteristics.  Further exploration for sedimentary 
copper-silver deposits in the Project is justified based on the above model, sample results and 
field observations made to date.   
 
8.3  INTRUSIVE-RELATED DEPOSITS 

The Andes hosts the most prolific porphyry copper-molybdenum deposits in the world and 
though not as abundant, significant porphyry copper-gold deposits – particularly in the 
Ecuador-Colombia sector.  These systems have a big footprint and great vertical extent.  They 
may be obscured by post-mineral cover or typically extensive lithocaps.  Discovering the 
economic part of the system may be more difficult, especially when dealing with skarns.  
However, productive systems will typically throw off a strong and extensive stream sediment 
anomaly in base metals and have varied but distinctive magnetic signatures. 
  



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019

8.3.1  PORPHYRY COPPER-GOLD AND COPPER-MOLYBDENUM 
 
Porphyry deposits typically form in and around cupolas of intermediate composition calc-
alkaline or alkalic magmas through which metal-rich fluids rise as they are expelled from the 
cooling batholith below.  In the most general terms, the hot magmatic fluids precipitate 
progressively more sulphur-rich assemblages as they rise, cool and react with their wall rocks.  
This results in a deep metal assemblage of magnetite, bornite and chalcopyrite with little 
pyrite and accompanied by potassic alteration - in the copper-gold porphyries this is the gold-
rich part of the system.  The upper reaches of many porphyries are characterized by 
magnetite-destructive alteration.  In the upper part of these systems early, potassic alteration 
assemblages are overprinted by QSP alteration and the pyrite to copper sulphide ratio rises 
sharply.  This pervasive alteration is hard to hide from even generative scale mapping and 
may stand out as a magnetic low in aeromagnetic data.   
 
Porphyry deposits have been a prime target for the Project largely based on the assumption 
that the metallogeny of the Cordillera de Cutucú is similar to that of the Cordillera del Cóndor 
immediately to the south.  The Cordillera del Cóndor uplift contains porphyry copper-gold 
and porphyry copper-molybdenum deposits including the now producing Mirador open-pit 
copper-gold mine that started production in mid-2019.   
 
8.3.2  SKARNS 
 
Skarns form adjacent to intrusive stocks where metal-rich magmatic fluids encounter 
favorable limestone or calcareous sandstone or conglomerates.  Hot, acidic, metal-rich 
hydrothermal fluids associated with the intrusive are neutralized as they migrate through the 
enclosing rocks.  When encountering a permeable limestone unit, the neutralization is much 
more rapid.  This potentially produces higher concentrations of sulphides as the limestone is 
replaced by calc-silicates, chlorite and sulphides.  Gold-bearing skarns are rare relative to 
gold-bearing porphyries but potential for exceptional grade makes them an attractive target.  
Owing to reactivity of the host rocks the footprint of the whole system will likely be much 
smaller than for a typical porphyry deposit.   
 
Potential for gold skarns in the Sub-Andean zone is highlighted by the multi-million-ounce 
Nambija gold skarn in the Cordillera del Cóndor.  Average gold grades are reported to be 
between 10 g/t and 30 g/t.  In 2000, Nambija resources were re-evaluated at between 4 million 
ounces ("Moz") and 5 Moz of gold (Prodeminca, 2000) after significant unofficial gold 
production since the discovery in 1981.

8.3.3  SANDSTONE HOSTED GOLD 
 
Neither within the Cordillera de Cutucú or the Cordillera del Cóndor has economically 
significant intrusion-related, sandstone-hosted, gold mineralization been recorded.  However, 
sections of calcareous sandstone of the Santiago Formation, and extensive sandstone sections 
in the Chapiza Formation, provide favorable hosts for fracture-hosted and disseminated gold 
mineralization such as that found in northern Peru.  Examples include Lagunas Norte, 
La Arena and Shahuindo, with the latter two lying immediately adjacent to porphyries.   
 
8.4  IRON OXIDE COPPER GOLD ("IOCG") 

IOCGs encompass a broad range of hydrothermal deposits generally spatially associated with 
large intrusive complexes (Figure 11).  However, unlike porphyry copper systems there may 
be no direct link to a mineralizing intrusion (Barton and Johnson, 2000).  Globally, the 
Proterozoic Gawler Craton and Cloncurry District of Australia, the Archean Carajas region of 
Brazil and the Jurassic Coastal Batholithic belt of Chile and Peru, host the most significant 
IOCG deposits.  Each of these areas host IOCG deposits of greater than 100 million tonnes at 
grades equal to or better, on average, than porphyry copper-gold deposits (Williams et 
al., 2005).   
 
The contained metal assemblage in IOCGs is associated with sulphur-poor minerals (the 
dominant iron species are hematite and magnetite), with pyrite being far less intensely 
developed in IOCGs relative to porphyries.  In IOCGs both the intensity of copper and gold 
mineralization and their ratios can be highly variable. 
 
IOCG alteration systems cover areas many times larger than the associated ore deposits but 
show alteration zoning broadly concentric around copper-gold mineralization.  The bulk of 
the IOCG alteration system is typically characterized by sodic to calcic alteration producing a 
suite of albite, chlorite, calc-silicates and carbonates.  Alteration intensifies in and near ore 
zones, with biotite, K-feldspar and amphibole typical of magnetite-rich deposits, and sericite 
and chlorite in hematite-rich deposits.

Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 47 - 

The well mineralized zones of IOCG systems can be found in diverse structural and 
stratigraphic settings that can focus hydrothermal activity.  These result in variable 
mineralized geometries including stratabound disseminated deposits, massive replacement 
deposits, high-grade vein-like bodies in fault zones, or large volumes of mineralized breccia.   
 
There remains uncertainty as to the relative contributions of iron, copper and gold from 
basinal brines relative to those from magmatic fluids, but in most districts, there is significant 
contribution from basinal brines and magmatic fluids may not be necessary (Barton and 
Johnson, 2000 and Contreras et al., 2018).  If dewatering of basins with volcanic rocks, 
continental sedimentary rocks, and evaporites are a key element in the genesis of IOCG 
deposits, then the Cordillera de Cutucú has all of these.   
 
The Cretaceous of northern Chile, where a belt of IOCG deposits is superimposed on a 
porphyry belt, might offer the best model for potential IOCG exploration in the Cordillera de 
Cutucú.  In the Chilean belt porphyries formed in a continental margin setting which evolved 
into a back-arc trans-tensional setting where the IOCG deposits formed.  The tectonic setting 
ultimately reverted back into an Andean-style continental arc associated with younger 
porphyry intrusion (Richards et al., 2017).   
 
8.5  LEAD-ZINC-SILVER VEINS AND MANTOS 

The metal assemblage found in these deposits places their priority below that of the precious 
metal and copper target types.  However, there is good potential for lead-zinc-silver mantos 
and veins based on the structural and stratigraphic setting of the Cordillera de Cutucú and 
limited sampling completed to date.   
 
Lead-zinc-silver deposits are found in multiple deposits types but the two of particular 
interest, due to their presence in the adjacent northern Peru, are: 
 
• Large veins and carbonate replacement deposits ("CRD's) in the form of mantos or 

chimneys related to intrusive centres; and  
• Carbonate hosted deposits related to basin dewatering – Mississippi Valley ("MVT") or 

Irish Type deposits.   
 
8.5.1  HYDROTHERMAL VEIN AND CRD's 
 
Mineralization in porphyry systems is typically zoned from a copper-molybdenum rich centre 
outwards to a lead-zinc-silver halo with the latter zone seldom achieving economic grades.  
However, there are cases like Butte, Montana, Bingham Canyon, Utah and Toromocho-



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 48 - 

Morococha, Peru, where both the copper-molybdenum centre and lead-zinc-silver halos host 
major ore deposits.  In the case of Butte, the lead-zinc-silver mineralization is in veins up to 
10 m wide cutting the Butte Quartz Monzonite.  In contrast, the porphyries at Bingham 
Canyon and Toromocho intruded sedimentary sequences with limestone horizons that were 
extensively replaced to produce large blanket shaped CRD's (mantos) or pipe-like bodies at 
structural intersections (chimneys).   
 
The presence of a mineralized copper porphyry is not necessary for the formation of these 
deposits, unmineralized porphyries can have significant associated lead-zinc-silver 
mineralization as is the case in multiple districts of central Mexico.  The porphyries 
preliminarily identified in the Cordillera de Cutucú have yet to be shown to have well 
developed copper porphyry mineralization, but these could still have generated lead-zinc-
silver CRD's in carbonates of the Santiago Formation.   
 
CRD's are challenging targets as the host limestones exhibit little alteration outside the actual 
replacement bodies which tend to be long and narrow, following irregular paths whether 
horizontal (manto) or steeply dipping (chimney). 
 
In addition to CRD's, low sulphidation epithermal precious metal veins, which are a prime 
target for the Project, may become base metal-dominant at depth and remain economically 
viable (e.g. Zacatecas, Mexico). 
 
8.5.2  MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND IRISH TYPE 
 
The same basin dewatering process discussed in Section 8.2 for copper can lead to formation 
of large carbonate replacement deposits along major structures and on the margins of a clastic 
sedimentary basins.  A good example is in the Zechstein Basin where deposits of this type are 
found adjacent to the copper zone of the Kupferschiefer (Borg et al., 2012).  These lead-zinc 
dominated deposits are difficult exploration targets as mineralized replacements can have 
irregular shapes, limited alteration haloes, and are commonly blind to the surface.  Their 
attractiveness lies in the potential for high-grade (+10% combined lead-zinc), and coarsely 
crystalline mineralization that, with simple processing, produces attractive lead and zinc 
concentrates.   
 
The correlative stratigraphy to the Santiago Formation in the Project in northern Peru is the 
Pucará Group that hosts multiple zinc-dominant MVT deposits in the San Vicente and 
Bongara Districts.

9.  EXPLORATION  
 
 
9.1  PROCEDURES/PARAMETERS OF SURVEYS AND INVESTIGATION 

To better understand structure and geology of Cordillera de Cutucú, Aurania began 
exploration with an airborne geophysical survey and satellite imagery interpretation.  Field 
work then focused on collecting geochemical data starting with stream sediment sampling at a 
density of approximately 2.7 samples per km2 throughout the Cordillera, a program which is 
approximately 50% complete.  Aurania is in the process of following-up anomalies identified 
through the above exploration programs with prospecting, rock chip sampling and ridge and 
spur soil sampling, followed by soil sampling on regular grids.  Geologists accompanying the 
sampling teams map geology and alteration mineral assemblages.  The objective is to identify 
targets for any style of mineralization for any commodity, and to provide an initial ranking of 
the targets for possible scout drilling as the main target evaluation tool.  Details of these 
programs follow in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 with discussion of results in Section 9.4. 

 
9.2  SAMPLING METHODS AND SAMPLE QUALITY 

9.2.1  STREAM SEDIMENT SAMPLING 
 
First pass stream sediment samples are collected at 800 m spacing along principal streams or 
rivers.  The second-order drainages adjacent to anomalies produced in the first order 
drainages are sampled every 400 m using the same protocols.  Through the Effective Date of 
this Report, 2,866 stream sediment samples have been collected with geochemical results 
returned for 2,816. 
 
Exploration teams collect samples where the strength of the current drops sharply, favouring 
deposition of heavy minerals.  A sampler collects sediment with a pointed shovel, removes 
cobbles by hand, and feeds the material onto a 5 mesh (4 mm apertures) PVC screen placed 
on top of a 20 mesh (0.84 mm apertures) PVC screen which is mounted on a 20 litre PVC 
bucket.  A second technician shakes the screens as water is dribbled over the sediment.  When 
the bucket has been filled with muddy water and -20 mesh sediment, the sampler decants 
about half the water in the bucket by pouring it over a wooden gold pan.  As water drains off 
the pan fine sediment collects in the pan and is returned to the bucket.  If the sampler 
determines that insufficient fine sediment has been collected, the sample-collection process is 
repeated until approximately 2 kg of -20 mesh material has been collected.  The final 
decanting is done by gradually pouring the muddy water and sediment into a cloth sample bag 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 50 - 

and squeezing water out through pores in the bag.  The entirety of the material in the bucket is 
collected in the bag.   
 
Photos are taken at each sample site showing the numbered sample bag and a whiteboard with 
the UTM coordinates of the sample point.  Samples are sent in batches of 30 to 200 samples 
including duplicates, blanks and standards (alternating) inserted every 20th to 25th sample.  
Through 2018 the samples were shipped to ALS Global's sample preparation lab in Quito in 
vehicles driven by Aurania's personnel.  Starting in 2019 Aurania switched to a sample 
preparation facility in Cuenca under contract with MSALABS with samples delivered to 
Cuenca in vehicles driven by Aurania personnel. 
 
At the Quito facility, ALS dried and screened the samples through an 80 mesh screen 
(0.177 mm apertures) and sent a 250 gram split of the -80 mesh fraction to ALS' analytical 
laboratory in Lima, Peru.  ALS analysed gold by fire assay of a 50 g split with ICP analysis 
(Au-ICP22).  51 elements (including gold) were determined using aqua regia digestion (a 
partial digestion) of a 0.5 split followed by ICP-MS analysis (ALS code ME-MS41).  Though 
Aurania switched laboratories in 2019, to MSALABS, for continuity, the preparation 
procedures and analytical techniques matched closely those used with ALS (MSALABS 
codes FAS-121 for gold and IMS130 for 51 elements). 
 
9.2.2  PAN CONCENTRATE SAMPLING 
 
Through the Effective Date of this Report, 78 pan concentrate samples have been collected 
with geochemical results returned for 67.  This sampling was initiated since Mr. Page's 
August site visit.  Aurania's intent now is to collect pan concentrates every 400 m to 500 m 
along streams as has been the case with the previously described stream sediment sampling 
spacing.  Sample sites are selected using the same criteria - where the strength of the current 
drops sharply favouring deposition of heavy minerals, and coordinates recorded using a 
handheld GPS unit.   
 
Superficial sediment is removed to a depth of 50-80 cm before collecting the sediment into a 
bucket.  A technician trained in panning techniques prepares a concentrate from the -20 mesh 
material which is collected in the same way as described for a stream sediment sample.  This 
concentrate is inspected on site for visible gold, and a note made of the number of gold grains, 
and the concentrate is then placed in a previously labeled plastic bag.  If needed, the operation 
is repeated until a sample of approximately 0.5 kg has been collected for analysis.   
 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 51 - 

Samples including duplicates, blanks and standards (alternating) inserted every 20th to 25th  
sample are sent to MSALABS and analyzed, for gold by fire assay of a 50 g split with 
AA finish (MSALABS code FAS-121), and for multi-elements using four-acid digestion and 
ICP-MS analysis for 48 elements (MSALAB code IMS-235). 
 
9.2.3  SOIL SAMPLING 
 
First pass soil sampling to follow-up stream sediment anomalies starts with collecting samples 
at 50 m intervals along the crests of ridges and spurs.  As results warrant, systematic grid 
sampling is done typically at a spacing of 25 m or 50 m on lines located 100 m apart.  At the 
start of the program, samplers dug small pits, up to one metre deep, collecting approximately 
1 kg of soil from the iron-rich "B" horizon along one side of the hole at each sample point.  
Currently, samples are collected from the same soil horizon by digging smaller diameter holes 
with a post hole digging tool.  Prior to 2019, samples, including standards and blanks 
alternately inserted approximately every 20th sample, were delivered by Aurania's personnel 
in batches of several hundred samples to ALS's preparation lab in Quito.  Sample preparation 
and geochemical analysis followed the same methods and procedures as those applied to 
stream sediment samples described in Section 9.2.1 above.  As with the stream sediment 
program, starting in 2019, Aurania switched to MSALABS and the affiliated sample 
preparation facility in Cuenca, following the same sample preparation and analytical 
procedures as used at ALS.   
 
Through the Effective Date of this Report, Aurania collected 8,937 soil samples with results 
returned for 8,209.   
 
9.2.4  ROCK CHIP SAMPLING 
 
Geologists and field technicians, trained by Aurania, collect rock chip samples where the 
geologist or prospector sees evidence of alteration or mineralization in float, cobbles in 
streams, or in outcrop.  The rock chip sampling is not done on a systematic grid basis.  The 
stream sediment and soil sampling programs highlight geochemically anomalous areas and 
the rock chip sampling tests for significant mineralization.  While most of the rock chip 
samples collected were samples of float or subcrop, Aurania took 822 outcrop samples of 
which 109 were collected over a measured width, or length and width in the case of panel 
samples.  Most of these samples were taken over lengths of less than a metre. 
  



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 52 - 

As with the stream sediment and soil samples, rock chip samples were prepared and analysed 
by ALS Global through 2018 and through MSALABS starting in 2019.  At ALS samples 
were analyzed for gold using fire assay of a 30 g split with AA finish (ALS code Au-AA25) 
and for an additional 48 elements using four-acid digestion (complete digestion) of a 0.25 g 
split with analysis by ICP-MS (ALS code ME-MS61).  For samples returning values of 
copper, lead or zinc exceeding 10,000 ppm (1%) or in the case of silver, 100 ppm, a second 
analysis was completed on the same pulp using four acid digestion and AA analysis (ALS 
code AA-OG62, MSALABS code ICF-6).  Starting in 2019, samples sent to MSALABS were 
analysed similarly, for gold fire assay of a 50 g split with AA finish (MSALABS code 
FAS-121), multi-elements using four-acid digestion and ICP-MS analysis for 48 elements 
(MSALAB code IMS-235), and over limits with four-acid digestion and AA analysis 
(MSALABS code ICF-6).   
 
Through the Effective Date of this Report, 1,672 rock chip samples have been collected and 
analysed with results returned for 1,543. 
 
9.2.5  DRILL CORE SAMPLING 
 
Personnel from the drill contractor, Kluane Drilling Ecuador S.A. ("Kluane"), boxed core at 
the drill rig and local personnel carried the core boxes to the access road for delivery in 
batches to the core shed by light truck.  The open-air core logging facility for the 
Crunchy Hill and Yawi targets is near the village of Patuca.  Given the scale of the Property, 
other core storage and logging facilities will likely be set up as additional anomalies are drill 
tested.  At the logging facility Aurania technicians lightly wash and then photograph the clean 
core.  A geologist does all the geological and geotechnical logging (core recovery and RQD) 
and selects intervals to be sampled.  The core logger marks sample intervals with a plastic 
sample tag taped to the side of the core tray at the start of the sample interval.  The logger 
then draws a line along the length of the core for that sample interval with a permanent 
marker as a guide for the core sawing technician.  After sawing, the right side of the core for 
each sample interval is placed, along with a sample tag, in a large mylar bag with the sample 
number marked on the outside of the bag.  The bags are closed and sealed with locking plastic 
ties.  Samples are stored at the logging and storage facility (which has 24-hour, 7 day a week 
security) until delivered by Aurania's personnel to MSALABS contract preparation facility in 
Cuenca.   
 
Alternating blanks and standards are inserted approximately every 20th sample.  Sample 
batches are shipped to the MSALABS affiliated preparation facility in Cuenca for preparation 
with 250 g pulps sent from the Cuenca to MSALABS laboratory in Langley, B.C., Canada.  
The analytical methods applied to drill core are the same as for rock samples described above.

Aurania collected 624, mostly 2 m long, samples from the core drilled at Crunchy Hill.  
Additionally, as of the Effective Date, 623 core samples, also mostly over 2 m intervals, had 
been taken during the drill program at the Yawi target area.   
 
9.3  RELEVANT INFORMATION 

Since 2017, Aurania has carried out stream sediment sampling across approximately 50% of 
the Property.  The geochemical sampling programs described in Section 9.2 provides much of 
the relevant information on which the interpretations in Section 9.5 are based.  In addition, the 
Company completed satellite image interpretation of the Project and adjacent area, completed 
a 12,960 line-kilometre heliborne magnetic and radiometric survey, of which 
5,714 line-kilometres were flown over the Property, and undertook reconnaissance geological 
mapping in conjunction with the stream sediment sampling program.  Concurrently, Aurania 
implemented an extensive community relations program.  The latter identified 56 indigenous 
communities in the project area with formal access agreements now secured from 40.  Each of 
these programs is summarized below (except for the community relations program which is 
covered in Section 20).   
 
9.3.1  SATELLITE IMAGE INTERPRETATION 
 
Aurania, through EcuaSolidus, contracted Michael Baker, an expert in image interpretation in 
jungle-covered areas, to complete satellite image interpretation over the Cordillera de Cutucú 
and adjacent Cordillera del Cóndor (Baker, 2017a, b, 2018 and 2019).  The first report was 
delivered in January 2017 with a 1:60,000 scale interpretation of 2001 Landsat images (30 m 
resolution) covering an area of 7,445 km² that includes the northern part of the adjacent 
Cordillera del Cóndor.  The intent was to compare interpreted geology and structure of the 
former to that of the latter which hosts the Zamora Batholith and the Mirador, San Carlos, 
Panantza and Warintza porphyry copper deposits.  The study area did not cover the Fruta del 
Norte epithermal gold deposit or the Nambija gold skarn deposit.   
 
Baker completed more focused satellite imagery interpretations in 2018 and 2019.  The 2018 
report utilized 1.5 m resolution SPOT imagery and the airborne geophysical data.  That study 
covered 613 km² in the Patuca area of the Project.  This is an area where geochemical 
anomalies indicated the presence of epithermal systems, including Crunchy Hill.  The 2019 
report utilized March 2015 Landsat8 imagery and the airborne geophysical data to better 
understand the geology of 766 km² of the Cordillera de Cutucú where field work identified 
widespread red-bed hosted copper-silver mineralization.

9.3.2  GEOPHYSICS 
 
The airborne geophysical survey, carried out by MPX Geophysics, Ltd. ("MPX"), covered 
the 2,077 km2 Property with east-west lines spaced 400 m apart and north-south orientated tie 
lines spaced 4 km apart, collecting magnetic, radiometric, and digital elevation data.  All lines 
were flown by helicopter with a mean terrain clearance of 60 m.  The survey data was quality 
assured and interpreted by Jeremy S.  Brett, M.Sc., P.Geo., Senior Geophysical Consultant 
with MPH Consulting Limited in Toronto, Canada.  Mr. Brett assessed the quality of the 
MPX survey data as 'industry standard', considering the severe topography and weather 
conditions on the Property (Brett, 2019). 
 
9.4  RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION OF EXPLORATION  

After acquiring the exploration rights over the Property, Aurania initiated exploration to 
identify large, potentially mineralized target areas.  This work included the airborne 
magnetics and radiometric survey and the well advanced, yet to be completed, stream 
sediment sampling program.  These programs produced multiple geophysical and 
geochemical anomalies potentially related to a variety of deposit types.  As the program 
identified anomalies Aurania began evaluating these through soil sampling, prospecting (rock 
chip sampling) and geological mapping of creek beds.  The intent is to advance this targeting 
work on individual anomalies to support initial scout drilling programs.  As of the Effective 
Date one target area, Crunchy Hill, had advanced through an initial drill program and scout 
drilling had been started on the Yawi target. 
 
This overall approach to advancing exploration over a large property position is standard in 
the exploration industry.  Discussion of results from the various programs is provided below. 
 
9.4.1  GEOPHYSICAL PROGRAM 
 
The focus of the airborne survey was to identify magnetic and radiometric anomalies 
potentially related to intrusive-related copper deposits (such as porphyries and IOCGs).  The 
magnetic and potassium radiometric responses from these deposit types are highly varied, 
depending on the depth of erosion, and type and scale of alteration and mineralization 
patterns.  Brett's processing of the magnetic data included (Brett, 2019): 
 
• Reduction to Pole ("RTP") of the Total Magnetic Intensity ("TMI") data provided by 

MPX.  This process reshapes anomalies to appear as if the data were measured at the 
magnetic north pole, where magnetic anomalies are symmetrical and centred over their 
causative sources.  This simplifies interpretation.  The RTP product was used to identify 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 55 - 

large magnetic features which are likely to be related to porphyry systems or clusters of 
porphyries or IOCG systems; 

• First Vertical Derivative ("1VD") processing of the RTP data is used to highlight near-
surface features; 

• High and Low Pass filters, set to multiple wavelengths, were applied to the RTP data to 
produce a series of maps enhancing anomalies related to large/deep and subtle/shallow 
geological features; and 

• Inversions of the TMI data were done over specific magnetic anomalies to estimate the 
size, shape and depth extent of causative bodies. 

 
Processing of radiometric data included: 
 
• Potassium ("K"), equivalent thorium ("eTh"), and equivalent uranium ("eU") response 

maps with data windowed to remove low amplitude signal, leaving just anomalous 
responses as follows:  

 
o For uranium, windowed to 0.75 ppm uranium (showing only response above that 

background level); 
o For thorium, windowed to 3.0 ppm thorium; and  
o For potassium, windowed to 1.1% potassium. 

 
• eU/eTh and K/eTh ratio maps, with values windowed above 0.35 and 0.50, respectively, 

to indicate anomalies above normal crustal abundance and potential for potassic alteration 
or an intrusive with a high potassium content.   

 
The potassium response is of the most interest with potassic alteration characteristic of the 
core of porphyry deposits (secondary biotite and potassic-feldspar) and for muscovite and 
illite in the core of low sulphidation epithermal systems.  Thorium is useful as the element is 
not mobile and using it in ratio with potassium can sharpen the detail of a zone with elevated 
potassium.   
 
Processing of the heliborne digital elevation data produced a model useful for interpreting 
structure in detail that is not as apparent in the magnetic data.   
 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019

The final products of the geophysical work include Property-wide maps showing the location 
of potential porphyry, and other target types, that have been provisionally ranked for 
follow-up.  Brett (2019), combining the various magnetic and radiometric responses, 
produced interpretations of subsurface geology throughout the Property.  Significantly, his 
geological interpretation indicates that there are more volcanic sequences and intrusions in the  
Cordillera de Cutucú than were mapped from satellite imagery.  Brett's most significant 
regional interpretations include: 
 
• Two large (up to 40 km in diameter), batholithic-scale intrusions at depth beneath the 

Cordillera de Cutucú; 

• A north-south - trending alignment of magnetic responses typical of andesitic volcanic 
magmatism in the Cordillera de Cutucú, an environment favorable for porphyry and 
epithermal deposits; 

• Multiple, generally elongate, northwest - or north-northeast - oriented potassium 
radiometric anomalies are present throughout the Property.  Areas where potassium 
anomalies coincide with magnetic features may indicate areas of potassic alteration related 
with porphyries.  Narrow, elongate radiometric anomalies, especially those that coincide 
with fault zones, may derive from kaolinite and/or illite alteration related with epithermal 
systems; and    

• Identifying 64 magnetic and 189 radiometric anomalies, of which 48% and 63% are 
ranked as high priority, respectively. 

 

The Cordillera de Cutucú, based on the digital elevation model ("DEM"), shows well-defined 
north and northwest - trending lineaments not apparent in the various magnetic map products.  
Furthermore, the DEM, in combination with the RTP data, shows porphyry targets on the 
edge of topographic highs. 
 
9.4.2  GEOCHEMICAL PROGRAM 
 
The geochemical database made available to the Author on the Effective Date (Aurania 
database version 123) contains data for the following: 
 
• Stream sediments - the most recent sample collected November 11, 2019; last sample for 

which geochemical results have been received were collected on October 7, 2019; 

• Soils - the most recent sample collected November 11, 2019; last sample for which 
geochemical results are posted was collected on September 9, 2019; and 

• Rock chips - the most recent sample collected November 23, 2019; last sample for which 
geochemical results are posted were collected on October 5, 2019. 

 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019

While significant numbers of stream sediment, soil, and rock chip samples have not been 
posted to the database available to the Author, the geochemical database is large and relevant.  
These geochemical results remain the primary support for carrying out further work on the 
target areas discussed in this Section 9.  A summary of the number of samples in the database 
available on the Effective Data are given in Table 2.

Aurania's geochemical database shows results for 2,816 stream sediment samples covering 
approximately 50% of the drainage basins on the Property.  Figure 12 shows the distribution 
of stream sediment samples taken.   
 
9.4.2.2  Soils 
 
Follow-up work on geochemical anomalies identified by stream sediment sampling included 
soil sampling along ridges and spurs and in detailed grids.  The grid sampling programs were 
done where results from stream sediment sampling, the ridge and spur sampling, or 
prospecting, indicated this more detailed sampling to be appropriate.  A discussion of results 
on specific anomalies follows in Section 9.5.

9.4.2.3  Rocks 
 
Aurania's prospectors and geologists sampled float and outcrop exhibiting alteration or 
mineralization.  Numerous samples returned potentially economic values in copper, lead and 
zinc and to a lesser extent silver as described in Section 9.5. 
 
9.5  INTERPRETATION OF INDIVIDUAL TARGET AREAS 

9.5.1  EPITHERMAL TARGETS 
 
9.5.1.1  Latorre Cluster – Crunchy Hill 
 
Stream Sediment Sample Results 
The Latorre anomaly cluster, based on the distribution of arsenic (>11 ppm) and antimony 
(>3.2 ppm) anomalies, covers over 100 km² (Figure 13).  Within the cluster, the Crunchy Hill 
target has seen the most work.  Crunchy Hill was identified through stream sediment samples 
anomalous in volatile elements such as arsenic, antimony, selenium and thallium, typically 
associated with low and intermediate sulphidation epithermal mineralization, along with silver 
and molybdenum (Figure 13).  Additionally, banded chalcedony veinlets in cobbles in streams 
and float blocks with up to 52.6 g/t silver, are consistent with the low and intermediate 
sulphidation epithermal models. 
 

Soil Sampling Results 
Soils in the Crunchy Hill area comprise a black organic-rich layer that overlies a homogenous, 
5-10 m thick, clay-rich, orange-coloured B-horizon.  Samples were taken from the upper 
50 cm of the B-horizon.  Soil samples were taken at 25 m intervals on lines spaced 100 m 
apart, that were then infilled along 50 m-spaced lines over the core of the anomalous area.  A 
description of the way in which soils are sampled, prepared and analysed from the Project is 
provided in Sections 9.2 and 11.  
  
Results from pathfinder elements in the soil samples (e.g. arsenic, antimony, mercury, silver, 
tellurium and thallium) delineate linear zones of enrichment that coincide with lead, zinc and 
molybdenum anomalism (Figure 14).  Aurania interprets manganese enrichment in the core of 
the geochemical anomaly to be consistent with an intermediate sulphidation epithermal 
system in which rhodochrosite is commonly associated with gold-silver mineralization.

The narrow corridors in which the pathfinder elements occur, within the broad one kilometre 
trend, is reminiscent of a typical vein system in which the individual veins are inclined to one 
another.  Molybdenum is not significantly mobile in acid environments generated from the 
oxidation of pyrite in the tropical soil profile found in southeastern Ecuador and is used as a 
tool that potentially marks the position and shape of the underlying vein system from which it 
was derived (Figure 15).  The confinement of other pathfinder elements, such as antimony 
and mercury, to coincident corridors with molybdenum supports the interpretation that the 
elongate zones of enrichment in pathfinder elements represent mineralized structures at depth.

Alteration Mapping 
Since outcrop is minimal over the area of anomalous soil geochemistry, float blocks and 
boulders were mapped and sampled for later SWIR spectral analysis.  Of the iron-bearing 
secondary minerals, jarosite was the most widespread, occurring over 200 m by 150 m in the 
core of the area of pathfinder anomalism (Figure 16).  Goethite has a more restricted 
distribution, confined to northeast- and northwest -striking zones within the jarosite zone.  
Hematite has a more restricted distribution still, confined to northwest-trending corridors.   
 
Veinlets filled with hematite, jarosite and goethite strike predominantly northeast with a steep 
dip to the southeast, with a smaller population striking north with a near-vertical dip 
(Figure 16).  Only two chalcedony veinlets were found in outcrop and these strike east to 
northeast and dip to the north-northwest. 
 

 
Inset are lower hemisphere projections of chalcedony and iron oxide/hydroxide veinlets.

Lithology 
Diamond drilling, details of which are provided in Section 10, intersected a sequence of 
sedimentary and volcano-sedimentary rocks near surface, overlying a volcanic-dominated 
sequence (Figure 17).  The central part of the stratigraphic sequence is made up of two 
distinct fragmental volcanic facies each approximately 100 m thick, interpreted by Aurania as 
hyaloclastites.  These mafic volcanic rocks are characterised by rounded clasts up to 30 cm in 
diameter enclosed within a volcanic matrix of similar composition.  The upper hyaloclastite 
unit contains mafic clasts, and is termed "basaltic hyaloclastite", while the lower unit that 
contains paler clasts with quartz eyes, is termed "dacitic hyaloclastite".  The hyaloclastites 
overlie a sequence of lavas without interbedded sedimentary or volcanoclastic units.

Based on their whole rock geochemistry, the volcanic rocks at Crunchy Hill range from high-
magnesium tholeiitic basalt, through basalt, andesite and dacite.  The nature of the 
stratigraphic sequence drilled at Crunchy Hill is consistent with a calc-alkaline continental 
volcanic arc developed in a marginally emergent or shallow subaqueous environment.   
 
Drilling 
Details of the scout drilling undertaken at Crunchy Hill are provided in Section 10. 
 
9.5.1.2  Latorre Cluster - Latorre A  
 
Geology 
The area is characterized by the presence of volcano-sedimentary units in the lower part of the 
Jurassic Santiago Formation, developed in a marine environment as evidenced by ammonites 
identified to be from the Arietitidae family (Figure 18a) and the Echioceras genus 
(Figure 18b).

The sequences observed in the area consist of black shale interlaminated with siltstone, fine 
sandstones, limestones, lapilli tuff and ignimbrite.  The volcanic units are more abundant to 
the southeast and east of the area.  The strata strike northwest and dip at 10° to 30° to the 
northeast.

In the area of the Latorre A soil anomaly the sequence is gently folded adjacent to faults 
striking approximately 040°.  These structures show discrete smectite and kaolinite alteration 
with fine pyrite and locally traces of chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena.  Immediately north 
of the Latorre A target area, outside of the Property, gold is exploited by artisanal miners from 
fluviatile gravel and sandstone of unknown age at an elevation of approximately 400 m above 
the main Upano River. 
 
Stream Sediment Sample Results 
Latorre A target is characterised by stream sediment anomalies in antimony, thallium and zinc 
on both flanks of a 3 km long hill (Figure 19).  Several of the streams draining the area are 
anomalous in epithermal pathfinders including arsenic, silver, mercury and selenium (see 
Figure 13).  Around the Latorre A target, gold is present in streams cutting sandstones and 
conglomerates overlying the Jurassic units. 
 

 
Figure 19.  Stream sediment geochemical anomalies in Latorre A present on both flanks of a hill 

 
 
Soil Sampling Results 
The preliminary spur and ridge soil survey highlighted three areas with epithermal pathfinder 
anomalies (Figure 20).   

• A large area in the northern part of the stream system is anomalous in mercury and 
bismuth with arsenic, molybdenum and selenium; 

• Anomalies in arsenic, molybdenum, antimony and selenium lie to the west, forming a 
southwest extension of the first anomaly; and 

• The soil anomaly detected by ridge and spur sampling in the south was covered with a 
50 m by 100 m grid.  Grid sampling revealed a silver anomaly over an area of 1 km2 
coincident with, or enclosed by, molybdenum, antimony, arsenic, selenium and thallium 
anomalies.  Zinc and cadmium anomalies partially rim the core anomaly.  Three samples 
show slight anomalism in gold.

Alteration Mapping 
SWIR spectral analysis of soil samples from Latorre A shows a central area with silica 
alteration surrounded by an illite-smectite mixed-layer clay alteration zone.  Silver anomalies 
in soil are concentrated in the core of the main silica alteration zone (Figure 21a) while other 
elements, such as molybdenum, are located on its margins (Figure 21b).  The silica-silver area 
is considered a target for epithermal gold-silver at depth.

9.5.1.3  Yawi 
 
Stream Sediment Sample Results 
Stream sediment sampling detected anomalous levels of volatile elements, plus silver and 
molybdenum, in several parts of the main drainage basin in the Yawi area (Figure 22).  Two 
groups of anomalies have been defined by the stream sample assays (Figure 22): 
 
• To the southwest of the main river, the stream sediment sampling shows molybdenum, 

antimony and selenium anomalies and isolated silver, arsenic, copper and mercury 
anomalies – typical of epithermal systems; and 

• On the north side of the basin a copper anomaly is associated with cobalt, gallium, nickel, 
scandium and vanadium and is potentially related to a porphyry system.

Soil Sample Results 
Ridge and spur soil sampling were done over the parts of the drainage basin in the Yawi area 
in which stream sediment results detected elevated levels of epithermal pathfinder elements.  
Aurania has identified six target areas based on the ridge and spur soil sampling, five of which 
have been advanced with more detailed grid soil sampling (Figure 23).  Volatile elements 
including arsenic, antimony, mercury and selenium are anomalous over extensive, and 
generally coincident areas.  Silver and molybdenum are associated with many of the volatile 
element anomalies and a low-level, but coherent gold anomaly is found with Targets A and C 
(Figure 24).  The target defined by ridge and spur soil samples in the northeast, and the sixth 
target in the southeast, has yet to be mapped and grid soil sampled.

Alteration 
Illite alteration mapped at Yawi, and confirmed through spectral analysis, broadly coincides 
with the volatile element, silver and molybdenum anomaly in Targets A and C (Figure 25).  
Quartz distribution inferred by spectral analysis, is closely associated with the low-level gold 
anomaly in soils in Target A (Figure 25). 
 
Pyrite and marcasite occur within the dominantly volcanic unit where some veinlets host local 
massive sulphide fillings.  Banded chalcedonic veinlets have crustiform to colloform textures 
and some breccias show cockade banding. The chalcedonic veins occur mainly in the volcanic 
sequence and are rarely in the laminated sedimentary or volcano-sedimentary sequence.

Blocks and subcrops of sinter occur sporadically over a narrow altitude range.  Some blocks 
show delicate encrustation of branches and reed stems (Figure 26), while others show 
vertically orientated, finger-like silica structures cored by marcasite and interpreted as silica 
encrustations on reed tips (Figure 27).  The sinter blocks and outcrops are located near the top 
of the mafic volcanic dominated stratigraphic sequence and underlie the stratified sediment 
and volcano-sediment dominated sequence.

Geology 
The Yawi area hosts calc-alkaline volcanic rocks ranging in composition from basalt to 
rhyolite and is divided by Aurania's mapping into three principal geological units that dip 
gently southward in the western part of the area and southeast in the eastern area (Figure 28).  
The central unit is an eastward-thinning mafic volcanic breccia similar to the hyaloclastite 
unit at Crunchy Hill.  A sequence of laminated fine-grained mudstones, siltstones, or 
laminated volcanoclastic rocks both underlies and overlies the mafic volcanic breccia with a 
discontinuous carbonate breccia at the top of the mafic unit.  Additionally, elongate dioritic 
intrusive bodies occur in the eastern part of the target area and a southeast-trending sill occurs 
in the central part of the target area.

Drill Target Concept 
The sinter blocks and outcrops are located approximately 300 m below the crest of the ridge 
that hosts coincident illite alteration, volatile element anomalies and silver and molybdenum 
anomalies in soils (Figure 29).  Typically, sinters would be found above the zone of illite 
alteration which could be explained by the illite zone being elevated by faulting or, 
alternatively two epithermal systems may be superimposed.  The six targets identified are 
described below. 

 

 
Figure 29.  Cross section illustrating the target concept for Yawi Target A 

 

 

Target A is located in the eastern part of the illite zone where the laminated unit hosts low, but 
consistent, levels of gold in soil (Figure 25).  Soil anomalies and alteration define northwest 
and northeast striking trends approximately 300 m above the sinter elevation.  Aurania 
interprets the gold – volatile element anomaly at the 1,100 m elevation (Figure 29) as leakage 
from a vein at depth, while the volatile element anomalies in soil between 700 m to 900 m 
elevation are interpreted to be from leakage along contacts in the laminated sedimentary and 
volcano-sedimentary sequence up-dip from a mineralized structure.  In this model, the 
sedimentary – volcano-sedimentary sequence is a target for disseminated, stratabound 
mineralization, while the more brittle underlying mafic volcanic unit is more likely to host 
mineralization in veins.

Target B (Figure 25) has an arsenic, silver, molybdenum, selenium, zinc anomaly, with low 
gold values, enclosed within an area of sinter.  Bore holes in Target B will test lower 
elevations than those tested in Target A. 
 
Target C (Figure 25) is along trend and to the west-northwest of Target A and is similarly 
defined by a volatile element anomaly coincident with illite in outcrop and enveloped by an 
extensive area of illite-smectite in soil.  Initial bore holes will test the illite-bearing zone and 
coincident geochemical anomaly at depth.   
 
Target D (Figure 25) lies to the east in an area underlain by the mafic volcanic unit hosting 
intense chalcedonic quartz veining.  The veins strike northeast with planned drill holes 
inclined to cut the veinlets at depth in the volcanic unit. 
 
Target E lies in the northern part of the Yawi area and at the highest elevations of the area.  
The target is defined by an extensive thallium anomaly and southeast and east-northeast 
trending mercury anomalies.  Scattered anomalous antimony values were also returned from 
the ridge and spur soil sampling. 
 
Target F lies in the southeast to the Yawi area where grid soil sampling defined a northeast 
trending zone of anomalous silver, arsenic, mercury, antimony and thallium.  Detailed 
geological follow-up is pending. 
 
9.5.1.4  Apai 
 
Geology 
The Apai target is underlain by a sedimentary unit of the Santiago Formation that lies west of 
two major north-south orientated faults.  Country rocks consist of alternating sandstones, 
mudstones and limestones that dip shallowly to the southwest.  The sedimentary sequence is 
overlain in the western part of the target area by mafic volcanics of the Piuntza Unit of the 
Santiago Formation (Figure 30). 
 
Scattered boulders and subcrops of opal and chalcedony, interpreted to have been derived 
from a sinter (Figure 31a), occur over a relatively flat 1.2 km by 0.5 km area.  The opal and 
chalcedony zone appears to pass beneath younger cover to the northeast and the sinter could 
be more extensive than it appears from surface mapping.  The sinter is enclosed by a zone 
1 km to 3 km wide area in which blocks of epithermal veins with cockade textures and 
breccias with chalcedony cement occur (Figure 32).

Weathered blocks of silicified granite, that are interpreted to have derived from steam-heating 
– near surface alteration that takes place in epithermal systems, occur in streams 
approximately 1 km north of the sinter zone.

Stream Sediment Sample Results 
The Apai target is defined by an extensive area of selenium enrichment associated with silver, 
mercury, arsenic and boron in the area around the sinter (Figure 32 and 33) and anomalies of 
antimony, silver, lead and selenium to the west.  Pan concentrate samples from the 
southwestern area of the sinter returned gold anomalies up to 1.67 g/t. 
 
Rock-Chip Results 
Barite veins with sphalerite, galena and yellow secondary cadmium minerals lie to the south 
of the sinter area.  Rock chip samples from barite veins contain up to 1.7 g/t silver, 
24 ppm mercury, 231 ppm arsenic and 0.36% zinc.  Further to the southeast, outside the 
Property, a fault exposure in a roadcut returned 1% zinc and 1.1 g/t silver. 
 
Rock chip samples taken near fault zones in the southeast and east show anomalous 
molybdenum (up to 67 ppm) and zinc (up to 1.3%).  Along the eastern-most fault, a quartz 
vein with chalcopyrite returned 0.3% copper.  The fault system extends southward onto the 
adjacent Coangos concession, held by a third party, from which copper and silver 
mineralization has been reported (Figure 35). 
 
9.5.1.5  Tiria 
 
Four target areas for epithermal gold-silver, Tiria North, Tiria East, and Tiria West, and Tiria 
South, have been identified through stream sediment sampling peripheral to the Shimpia 
silver-zinc-lead target described in Section 9.5.2. 
 
Stream Sediment Sample Results 
A total of 692 stream sediment samples were taken in the Shimpia-Tiria target area.  Results 
of stream sediment sampling in the area are summarized in Figures 34 and 35.    
 
The target areas are: 
• Tiria North is defined by two small rivers draining high ground with anomalous arsenic, 

antimony, mercury, selenium, thallium (Figure 34) and silver and zinc (Figure 35);  

• Tiria East covers an area approximately 4 km long with stream sediments anomalous in 
arsenic, thallium (Figure 34), zinc, antimony, mercury, and molybdenum (Figure 35); 

• Tiria West is a 2 km long area with three streams showing antimony, selenium and 
cadmium anomalies.  Of these, the two northern streams are also anomalous in silver, 
arsenic, molybdenum, thallium and zinc (Figures 34 and 35); and 

• Tiria South the stream sediment results show a core area of thallium partially enclosed by 
antimony and mercury (Figure 34).

Soil Sampling Results 
Ridge and spur soil sampling has been completed over the Tiria North, West and South target 
areas and initiated over Tiria East (Figure 36) the results of which are discussed below. 
  
• At Tiria East, as of the Effective Date, only 10% of the area been covered with ridge and 

spur soil sampling.  The limited sampling shows a continuous, 1.5 km long anomaly in 
arsenic, copper, molybdenum, antimony, selenium and thallium with patchy gold 
anomalies extending over three ridges;  



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 82 - 

• Tiria North soil results show a mercury anomaly at the crest of a hill and barium, copper, 
molybdenum, antimony, selenium, thallium and zinc anomalies at lower elevations; 

• Tiria West sampling shows a tight cluster of elevated gold values with mercury and 
selenium; and 

• The Tiria South epithermal target is evident in ridge and spur soil sampling conducted 
over the Shimpia area while it was being investigated for silver-lead-zinc replacement 
deposits.  The anomaly corresponds with a suspected north-south- oriented structure.  Two 
parallel anomalies are evident (Figure 36): the first in molybdenum (not shown), 
antimony, selenium, thallium and mercury located east side of Tiria South and a second 
area to the west anomalous in arsenic, antimony, mercury, and thallium (and not shown - 
bismuth, cobalt, iron, manganese and tellurium).

Geology 
The Tiria targets lie along the contact between limestone and a sequence of interlayered shale 
and sandstone.  Satellite imagery shows that a major fault cuts through the Tiria target area 
coincident with a linear, potassium radiometric anomaly that passes through the Tiria East and 
South target areas.  The epithermal model for the targets is supported, not only by the trace 
element suite, but also by the occurrence of banded chalcedony and silicified breccias found 
in float (Tiria East and North targets) and by gossans with up to 1,160 ppm arsenic, 
1,610 ppm antimony and 67 ppm mercury. 
 
9.5.2  SILVER-ZINC-LEAD TARGETS 
 

9.5.2.1  Shimpia  
 
Stream Sediment Sample Results 
Stream sediment sampling identified extensive barium and silver enrichment over a 12 km by 
3 km area defining the current limits of the Shimpia target.  Significantly, within the 
southeastern and northwestern parts of this large barium-silver anomaly Aurania's sampling 
returned anomalous lead and zinc (Figure 35).   
 
Volatile elements including arsenic, mercury, selenium, thallium and antimony, are enriched 
near the Shimpia target and have been discussed in the previous section.  The Tiria South 
target, however, is further described here since it has silver-zinc-lead-barium anomalism in 
addition to the typical epithermal pathfinder elements (Figure 35). 
 
Rock Sample Results 
Grab samples collected by the reconnaissance exploration teams included samples of semi-
massive sphalerite, galena, and barite replacing limestone (Figure 37).  Analyses show up to 
710 g/t silver, 39% lead and 48% zinc (Tables 3 and 4).  These samples also contain up to 
4,140 ppm arsenic, 67 ppm mercury and 1,610 ppm antimony. 
 
Aurania has reported two different mineralization styles: 
 
• Barite veins with semi-massive sphalerite, pyrite and some galena have been found in 

limestone boulders in rivers draining the area.  Additionally, a vein outcrop in the 
southern part of the target has been mapped for approximately 50 m along its 335° strike 
(dipping 70° northeast); and 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 84 - 

• Crackle breccia with sphalerite, pyrite, galena and silica infilling silicified limestone 
fragments.  This mineralization type was found in the northwestern parts of the Shimpia 
target area.  The body extends over a strike of at least 300 m, oriented northwest-
southeast, with an estimated width of several tens of metres.

Lithology 
The eastern part of the target area is dominated by a clastic sequence of sandstone, siltstone 
and shale, becoming interbedded with limestone up-section in the west.  Bedding strikes 
150°-160° dipping 5°-30° southwest (Figure 39).  Folding is locally developed adjacent to 
faults.  Brecciation with calcite infill between the fragments, and calcite stockworks are 
commonly developed along anticlinal hinges.

9.5.3  SEDIMENTARY-HOSTED COPPER-SILVER TARGETS 
 
9.5.3.1  Kirus – Jempe Basin 
 
Geology 
The Kirus, Tsenken and Jempe sedimentary-hosted copper-silver targets cover an area 23 km 
long by 7 km wide within a Mid- to Late- Jurassic sedimentary basin.  The sedimentary basin 
has been filled by a thickness of at least 2,400 m of red-beds, comprising a coarsening-
upwards sequence of mudstone, siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate of the Chapiza 
Formation (Figure 40).  The red-bed sequence is underlain to the west by a thick limestone 
and black mudstone unit and is overlain to the east and in the centre of the basin by a mature 
sandstone unit.  The sandstone unit locally contains carbonaceous fossil plant fragments. 
 
The red-beds were deposited in a series of grabens and half grabens in which volcanoclastic 
beds in the upper part of the sequence attest to contemporaneous igneous activity.  
Additionally, porphyritic gabbro and diorite stocks intrude the red-bed sequence.  Two main 
sub-basins are recognised in the Project area; the northern one is more complex and is 
subdivided by an intra-basin high.  Basin margin faults trend north-northwest and were 
inverted prior to an onlap in the Cretaceous.  The red-beds are gently folded, with fold 
amplitudes increasing in proximity to the inverted faults (Figure 41).   
 
White to grey feldspathic sandstone layers 0.1 to 2.5 m thick occur locally within the red-bed 
sequence.  These reduced sedimentary layers, with carbonized plant fragments, are the main 
host of copper - silver mineralization.   
 
Gypsum is commonly found in veins associated with north-striking faults and a salt dome is 
located in the northern part of the area in which sedimentary-hosted copper-silver has been 
found.

The sedimentary-hosted copper-silver mineralization found to date is confined to specific 
horizons of carbon-bearing sedimentary units found in scattered outcrops over 23 km of strike 
(Figure 42).  The copper-silver mineralization is present as malachite, chrysocolla, tenorite, 
chalcocite, cuprite and native copper, and is hosted by bleached, reduced sandstone and 
carbonaceous shale.  The strongest mineralization is found in strata with fossilized plant 
fragments (Figure 43).

Reconnaissance Exploration 
Reconnaissance exploration identified malachite- and tenorite- bearing boulders in streams 
that contain up to 11.9% copper with 166 g/t silver.  Follow-up exploration led to the 
discovery of mineralization with up to 5.1% copper and 70 g/t silver in sporadic outcrops over 
a 2 km trend immediately northwest of the Kirus magnetic feature (Figure 44).

Conspicuous malachite- and chrysocolla- bearing boulders have been encountered in streams 
immediately north of the Tsenken magnetic anomaly.  Initial grab samples from boulders 
returned up to 7.2% copper with 70 g/t silver, with subsequent outcrop sampling returning up 
to 39% copper with 263 g/t silver in a black shale unit (Figure 45).

Follow-up Exploration 
Follow-up exploration of the Tsenken target has tracked the favorable horizon for 2.5 km 
along strike in a sequence of reduced, sedimentary beds.  Aurania, using mineralized outcrop 
locations in the steeply incised topography, generated a provisional elevation contour map of 
the favourable horizon.  The map can be used as a base on which to define trends in copper-
silver mineralization within the sedimentary layer, and initial drill planning (Figure 46).

9.5.3.4  Interpretation and Exploration Model 
 
As of the Effective Date, the strongest copper-silver mineralization discovered in the Project 
is stratabound in reduced layers above a thick and extensive red-bed basin.  This is the classic 
location of red-bed copper of the Central African Copperbelt and the European 
Kupferschiefer.  Sediment hosted mineralization on the Property has not been demonstrated to 
have the enormous lateral continuity of either the Copperbelt or the Kupferschiefer, but the 
genetic and exploration models developed for those regions provide an exploration guide for 
the Project.   
 
Aurania's current exploration model for this sedimentary-hosted mineralization has copper-
silver mineralization localized along a north-trending anticlinal fold axis located along the 
core of the Cordillera de Cutucú.  Red-bed copper is thought to derive from leaching of 
copper from the sedimentary rocks by chlorine-rich, oxidized fluids, and hence the occurrence 
of evaporite sequences and salt domes within the red-beds, is thought to be fundamentally 
important to the development of these deposits.  In addition to that potential source of copper, 
mapping has shown the red-beds of the Chapiza Formation to have been intruded by 
subvolcanic and plutonic rocks which is shown schematically in (Figure 47).   
 

 
(modified after Hitzman et al., 2012)  

Figure 47.  Exploration model for red-bed style mineralization for the Project  



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 96 - 

Aurania believes the numerous magnetic features identified in the airborne survey may be 
related to mineralized porphyry or IOCG systems that have intruded the red-beds, providing 
an additional potential source of copper.  The porphyries would be related to a late Jurassic 
island arc superimposed on the mid-Jurassic rift basin in which the red-beds accumulated.  
Since IOCG systems tend to develop in extensional tectonic settings, they may have 
developed contemporaneously with red-bed accumulation. 
 
The genetic model has copper, whether leached from sediments or from mineralized porphyry 
or IOCG systems, transported through the basin as chloride complexes.  The copper- and 
silver- rich brine would have been driven laterally along more permeable units within the 
red-bed sequence.  Fault zones would have provided the cross-stratal permeability allowing 
the warm metal-rich fluid to ascend until it came in contact with reduced strata that induced 
precipitation of copper and silver (see Figure 47). 
 

9.5.4  INTRUSIVE-RELATED TARGETS 
 
9.5.4.1  Nature of Igneous Rocks 
 
Whole rock analysis of magnetic, intensely plagioclase-rich volcanic and subvolcanic rocks 
classifies these rocks in a subalkaline series consisting of basaltic-andesite, andesite and 
rhyolite.  The subvolcanic porphyritic rocks are closely associated with complex positive 
magnetic features in the geophysical data.  Limited outcrop suggests that most of the 
subvolcanic rocks encountered to date are dykes, some of which are at least 100 m wide.   
 
9.5.4.2  Porphyry Targets 
 
Awacha 
Stream sediment results show that drainages from the Awacha A and Awacha B magnetic 
anomalies (Figure 48) are anomalous in copper, molybdenum and arsenic.  Lead shows slight 
enrichment east of the molybdenum and copper anomalies, while zinc shows no anomalism.  
These data are consistent with a porphyry target in which copper-molybdenum generally 
occurs near the centre of the mineralized zone, partially enclosed by an area of lead 
enrichment.  In addition to the Awacha A and B anomalies there are 13 discrete magnetic 
centres in the Awacha area requiring additional investigation.  This will include further stream 
sediment sampling and ridge and spur soil sampling.   



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 97 - 

A rock chip sample taken from the QSP zone during initial reconnaissance exploration of the 
Awacha target contained 0.3% copper and 0.2 g/t gold.  Although this result is only from one 
sample, and neither Mr. Page nor Mr. Phillips were able to visit the sample site, it is 
significant both for relative strength of the copper and gold values and the ratio of copper to 
gold which falls within the range typical of copper-gold porphyries. 
 

 
Figure 48.  Stream sediment sample results from the Awacha targets shown on an RTP magnetic image 

 
 
The Awacha area lies in an area with Silurian-Devonian Pumbuiza Formation slate, quartzite 
and minor conglomerate cut by diorite dykes.  QSP alteration, confirmed by PIMA spectral 
analysis, is found in clastic sedimentary rock outcrops encountered in the area with Aurania 
reporting the pyrite content of some sedimentary layers reaches 50%.  Exposures of dioritic 
dykes show them to be unaffected by QSP alteration but showing potassic alteration in the 
form of secondary biotite, although with minimal accompanying mineralization.   
 
The QSP alteration, along with stream sediment enrichment in copper and molybdenum and 
the coincidence of these anomalous areas over magnetic features evident in the geophysical 
data, are characteristics of porphyry targets.  The moderate enrichment of arsenic and lead on 
the periphery of the core area is also consistent with the porphyry model.

Tsenken N2 
Stream sediment results show an anomalous zone of copper, cobalt and vanadium over a 
northeast elongate trend of alternating magnetic highs and lows (Figure 49).  The highest 
copper values come from the Tsenken North 2 and North 3 target areas.  Molybdenum is not 
anomalous in stream sediments from these target areas. 
 

 
Figure 49.  Stream sediment sample results from the Tsenken N2 target shown on an RTP magnetic image.   

Also shown is the location of an outcrop of QSP alteration 
 
 
A 100 m by 50 m soil grid was sampled over the Tsenken N2 target and results show a strong 
and coherent copper anomaly superimposed by a patchy cobalt anomaly (Figure 50).  
Bismuth, molybdenum and lead anomalies are largely peripheral to the copper-cobalt 
anomaly.  The copper anomaly in soil measures 2,000 m by 300 m over the Tsenken N2 
magnetic feature (Figure 50). 
 
The magnetic anomaly at Tsenken N2 coincides with a subvolcanic intrusive of trachy-
andesitic (dioritic) composition and porphyritic texture intruding Chapiza Formation red-beds.  
Limited mapping of the next magnetic feature to the north, the Tsenken N3 target, has 
identified sub-volcanic, sub-alkaline intrusive rocks ranging in composition from gabbro, 
through diorite to syeno-diorite with conspicuous porphyritic textures.  The igneous rocks 
have a significant magnetite content.

Exploration Model & Approach 
The primary goal is to find one or more sub-cropping copper-gold or copper porphyry 
systems through follow-up of the stream sediment anomalies with prospecting, mapping, 
detailed soil sampling and potentially collecting more detailed airborne geophysical data.  
Once the characteristics of the porphyry bodies in the Cordillera de Cutucú are better 
understood, exploration may shift from exploring for systems located immediately beneath 
the soil layer to more deeply buried targets. 
 
The porphyries closest to the Cordillera de Cutucú are the copper-gold system at the Mirador, 
and the San Carlos and Panantza copper-molybdenum deposits in the Cordillera del Cóndor, 
approximately 25 km south of the Project.  These Jurassic porphyries have classic alteration 
zoning typified by QSP alteration above and outboard of a mineralized, magnetic core of 
potassic alteration that hosts most of the economic mineralization.  In the Cordillera del 
Cóndor, only vestiges of secondary copper blankets are preserved above these deposits owing 
to the relatively deep current erosion profile.  In contrast, the Cordillera de Cutucú is 
suspected to have been less deeply eroded and therefore if secondary copper blankets were 
formed, they could be more completely preserved.

9.5.4.3  IOCG Targets 
 
Kirus 
The Kirus target is a complex magnetic feature approximately 5 km in diameter (Figure 51a).  
Aurania's mapping identified blocks of fine-grained igneous rocks in the deep soil profile, 
suggesting that intrusive rocks lie beneath.  The intrusive bodies are elongate, having a 
northeast-southwest trend; it is not clear if this is a preferred orientation of intrusion, or 
whether it results from later displacement on northeast-striking faults (Figure 51b).  The 
northwest margin of the magnetic high is marked by a conspicuous northeast-striking 
lineament, northwest of which is a deep magnetic low.  The linear feature is interpreted by 
Aurania to be a northwest-dipping normal fault, potentially with several kilometres 
displacement, that was active when the red-beds of the Chapiza Formation accumulated.  The 
northeast margin of the intrusive complex is controlled by a north to northwest-trending fault.   
 
Subvolcanic intrusive rocks cut red-beds of the Mid-Jurassic Chapiza Formation on the east 
limb of a regional synclinal fold.  No clear relationship, if any, has been established between 
the intrusive complex and copper-silver mineralization in the red-beds 2-3 km to the 
northwest (Figure 51b).

Stream sediment sample results show elevated copper values up to 312 ppm on the western 
flank of the Kirus intrusive complex.  The intrusive complex is associated with scattered 
copper, lead and zinc anomalies (Figure 52) and is more consistently anomalous in cobalt, 
iron, vanadium, and manganese (Figure 53).  Not shown in the figures are gallium, rare earth 
(e.g. cerium and scandium), germanium, and phosphate anomalies within the intrusive 
complex.  The area to the west of the intrusive complex contains sedimentary-hosted copper-
silver mineralization as described in Section 9.5.3.

Tsenken Dyke 
A 100 m wide dyke on the southwest margin of the Tsenken magnetic feature trends north- 
northeast and is mapped by Aurania as a plagioclase-phyric, magnetite-bearing diorite.  The 
dyke exhibits intense albitic and chloritic alteration with olivine replaced by iddingsite.  
Copper occurs disseminated and in 1 cm wide albite veinlets.  Native copper occurs with 
chalcocite, covellite and trace pyrite.  A sample from the dyke returned 4.8% copper and 
12.4 g/t Ag.  Aurania plans to follow-up the IOCG style alteration system with grid soil 
sampling. 
 
Exploration Model & Approach 
Aurania's original analysis of the airborne geophysical survey interpreted numerous magnetic 
features as potential porphyry targets modelled on Mirador, San Carlos and Panantza in the 
adjacent Cordillera del Cóndor.  However, the dominant sodic alteration (albite growth and 
overgrowth of pre-existing feldspar phenocrysts) with chlorite and magnetite, with only minor 
sericite and pyrite development, is typical of IOCG systems.  Furthermore, the chemical 
signature of these targets: copper with coincident cobalt, vanadium and rare earth elements, is 
consistent with IOCG mineralization.

The primary exploration tool will be soil geochemistry.  Interpretation will need to take into 
account that the relative stability of metals will be influenced by the pH of the soils which will 
be near-neutral in the case of an IOCG system due to the typically low sulphide content, in 
contrast to acidic in the case of a porphyry system where their sulphide-rich mineral 
assemblage has been oxidized.  For example, Aurania reports that porphyry copper deposits in 
the adjacent Cordillera del Cóndor were characterized by central molybdenum anomalies in 
soils enclosed by copper at lower elevations due to copper being more mobile than 
molybdenum in the acidic soil conditions generated by the oxidation of pyrite.  In more 
neutral conditions developed over IOCGs that typically have less pyrite than porphyries, 
molybdenum is likely to be more soluble than copper, leading to an inverse relationship to 
that seen over porphyries – that is, a central copper anomaly with peripheral molybdenum in 
soils (Levinson, 1979).

10.1  CRUNCHY HILL 

10.1.1  DRILL DATA 
 
Scout drilling at Crunchy Hill was done with a man portable Hydrocore Gopher diamond drill 
"KD 1000-08" model that started on March 3, 2019 and finished on May 8.  All holes were 
collared with "H-thin wall" ("HTW") bits yielding 71 mm diameter core, and all, except hole 
CH-2019-009, were reduced at a depth below 220 m to "N-thin wall" ("NTW") producing 
56 mm diameter core.   
 
Nine diamond drill holes were completed at Crunchy Hill testing a low to intermediate 
sulphidation epithermal precious metal target model.  The program totalled 3,204 m from 
which Aurania cut 624 samples for a cumulative length of 1,087.74 m.  Figure 54 shows hole 
locations and drill traces with header data provided in Table 5.

10.1.2  DRILL RESULTS 
 
10.1.2.1 Veins and Alteration 
 
SWIR spectral analysis of core revealed pervasive chlorite-calcite alteration giving way to 
prehnite-calcite alteration at depth on the scale of the target area.  More intense alteration is 
confined to vein selvages.  Two principal veins and vein-breccias were intersected 
(Figure 55): 
 
• Bore holes CH-005 and CH-007 cut what is termed the "5-7 Structure"; and   
• Bore hole CH-009 cut the "9 Structure".   
 
The 5-7 structure consists mainly of a gypsum- and calcite-cemented breccia, where 
intersected at an altitude of approximately 800 m amsl in hole CH-005, and by calcite with 
minor chalcedony in hole CH-007 at 700 m amsl.  The selvage on the vein margins changes 
from kaolinite to illite with depth between holes CH-005 and CH-007.  Fine pyrite banding 
(Figure 55) accompanies much of the calcite veining and minor buddingtonite (ammonia-
bearing adularia) is also present based on SWIR spectral analysis. 
 
The 9 Structure zone consists of two fault zones hosting narrow zones of opaline chalcedony 
in laminated sedimentary and volcano-sedimentary strata and in mafic volcanic rocks that 
underlie the laminated strata.  Alteration in the easternmost structure is dominated by illite 
with minor kaolinite.  Alteration assemblages extend outward from the structures along the 
layering of the laminated sediments.

10.1.2.2 Assay Results 

 
All the bore holes drilled at Crunchy Hill returned intersections of anomalous silver along 
with pathfinder anomalies in arsenic, antimony, selenium, and thallium consistent with the 
low to intermediate sulphidation epithermal model.  Gold was mostly below the 
5 ppb detection limit with only a few samples returning 10 ppb and a single sample returning 
20 ppb gold.  The principal anomalous intervals are shown in Table 6.

10.1.2.3 Interpretation 
 
While failing to encounter potentially economic values of either gold or silver, geochemical 
results and alteration assemblages observed in the drilling support the low or intermediate 
sulphidation epithermal model for the Crunchy Hill target area.  The gypsum and calcite 
content of the 5-7 Structure, with increasing chalcedonic silica content at depth, is interpreted 
by Aurania to represent the upper part of an epithermal vein in which relatively low fluid 
temperatures were in equilibrium with the enclosing prehnite-calcite alteration.  Illite is 
present as a thin vein selvage in the deeper intersection in bore hole CH-007 indicating 
slightly higher hydrothermal temperatures (Figure 56) and a vector towards potential precious 
metal mineralization.   
 
Aurania's target model for gold mineralization at Crunchy Hill is predicated in part on the 
presence of sinter-textured silicified blocks found at the top of the hill (at 1,000 m to 1,100 m 
elevation) and interpreted to mark the paleo-surface at the time of alteration and 
mineralization.  If correct, the well-developed low sulphidation epithermal model then places 
the productive zone at 500 m – 600 m amsl – approximately 500 m below the crest of 
Crunchy Hill.   
 
Along the 5-7 Structure the target lies where the potentially favourable laminated sedimentary 
and volcano-sedimentary unit, seen in CH-009, is cut down-dip by the 5-7 structure at 
approximately 500 m amsl (Figure 56).  The model targets both the vein-breccia in the 
structure and the favourable laminated unit extending away from the structure.  Additionally, 
it is known from outcrop and from the intercept on hole CH-009 that the laminated unit 
contains carbon, a strong reducing agent for the precipitation of gold from solution.   
 
In the area of the 9 Structure, cut by hole CH-009, the low sulphidation epithermal model 
target for vein-hosted mineralization lies where the fault zone cut mafic lavas at an elevation 
of 500 to 600 m amsl (Figure 56). 
 
The detailed stratigraphy derived from a compilation of the drill data is described in 
Section 9.

10.2.2  DRILL TARGETS 
 
Bore holes in the first scout drilling at Yawi were sited as follows:  

• Target A: 
o Drill hole YW-001, inclined at 60° to the south with a total depth of 553.4 m, was 

designed to test northwest and northeast- dipping veins beneath a northeast- and 
northwest- striking soil anomaly.  The hole cut multiple veinlets with chlorite-pyrite 
selvages lined by calcite and white clay (illite), terminating with finely banded 
chalcedony in the core of the veinlets (Figure 58).  Many of the veinlets intersected in 
YW-001 were sub-parallel to core axis; and 

o Drill hole YW-002 was drilled on the same section line but collared to the south and 
inclined at 65° to the north to intersect the veinlets cut in Hole YW-001 at a 
perpendicular angle.  The hole, terminated at a depth of 559.3 m, encountered 
numerous calcite and chalcedony veinlets in the lower part of the hole. 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 110 - 

• Target B: Hole YW-003 was drilled to 260.6 m, inclined at 50° due south beneath an area 
of abundant sinter blocks.  The bore hole intersected upward-fining sequences of volcano-
sedimentary rocks.  The basal coarse facies are typically matrix-supported and polylithic 
with juvenile mafic volcanic clasts that grade upward into finely laminated volcano-
sediments.  These are interpreted by Aurania to be maar sediments, intruded in places by 
matrix-supported diatreme breccias.  Chalcedony veinlets have alteration selvages of 
kaolinite-illite, and illite alteration becomes more pervasive in the deeper, thicker 
breccias; and 

• Target C: Hole YW-004 was drilled to a depth of 516.6 at 60° due north to intersect a vein 
target beneath the northwestern extension of the Target A soil geochemistry anomaly.  
This hole did not intersect a significant vein: it did, however, cut multiple chalcedony-
cored veinlets developed within mafic volcanic sequences interlayered with maar-type 
layered, upward-fining sequences.

11.  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
 
11.1  SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ASSAYING 

Sample preparation and analytical methods used for stream sediment, soil, rock chip and core 
samples are covered in Section 9 above.   
 
11.2  QA/QC 

Aurania's QA/QC protocols for rock, soil, stream sediment, and drill core are more than 
adequate for an early stage exploration program.  The company follows a practice of inserting 
geochemical reference material ("standards"), geochemically barren material ("blanks"), 
and duplicate samples at regular intervals such that most sample submissions have at least two 
control samples.  Analytical values of six potential ore metals from 11 different standards are 
plotted on multiple control charts that are updated on receipt of each batch of analytical data.   
 
11.2.1  GEOCHEMICAL STANDARDS 
 
Aurania uses commercially available standards supplied by Ore Research & Exploration Pty 
Ltd. of Australia (standards labelled OREAS) and by AMIS African Mineral Standards of 
South Africa (standards labelled AMIS).  Both companies are well known suppliers of 
standards to the minerals industry.  Aurania based its selection of standards on the type of 
sample, be it stream sediment, soil, or rock chip.  At least one standard would accompany 
each shipment to the preparation and analytical facilities. 
   
Standards used for QA/QC of soil and stream sediment samples submissions were selected for 
the range of certified values in both metals and indicator elements of potential interest.  All 
standards submitted have certified values for gold.  They do not all have certified values for 
silver, arsenic, antimony, copper, lead and zinc.  The standards used through the Effective 
Date, and for which results have been received, are listed in Table 8 showing certified values 
based on aqua regia digestion.  The table also shows the number of each standard used and the 
number of failures by element.  Failures were defined as two consecutive samples exceeding 
±2 standard deviations from the certified value, or any single sample exceeding 3 standard 
deviations.  The failures for gold and copper in OREAS 45d result from mislabelling a 
standard.

TABLE 8.   
CERTIFIED VALUES FOR 8 ELEMENTS IN THE 9 STANDARDS INSERTED IN  

SOIL AND STREAM SEDIMENT SAMPLE SUBMISSIONS  

The certified values are based on Aqua Regia Digestion   

 
 
The standards Aurania selected for QA/QC of rock and drill core sample submissions had, for 
the most part, higher metal values and were based on the more complete four acid digestion 
method.  These standards are listed in Table 9 which shows the certified values based on four 
acid digestion.   
 

TABLE 9.   
CERTIFIED VALUES FOR 5 METALS IN THE STANDARDS SUBMITTED WITH  

DRILL CORE AND ROCK CHIP SAMPLES  

 
 
 
There have been relatively few control sample failures and most of them are failures to the 
high side of a certified value.  Aurania has determined that in the few cases where a failure 
could not be attributed to a sample labelling error (Figure 59) that the failures did not justify 
taking further action.  For the stage of the Project, where none of analyses received to date 
will be incorporated in a resource estimate, this approach is acceptable to a limit.  Where a 
failure is to the high side of a certified value, the effect would be to see higher values for the 
metal that failed in adjacent samples.  A geochemical anomaly would not be missed – it might 
even appear enhanced.  More care should be taken with failures to the low side of a certified 
value.  Left unresolved, such a failure could result in missing a geochemical anomaly in 
adjacent samples.  Control charts for multiple elements for each standard used are provided in 
Appendix 1.

The failures are well below where the 3 standard deviation lower limit would plot.  Aurania determined that 
the failed standard was a mislabelled sample of AMIS 178 standard.   

 
 
 
11.2.2  BLANKS 
 
Aurania uses an unaltered friable volcanic ash blank which is included in all rock chip, core, 
soil and stream sediment sample shipments.  The volcanic ash has proved to consistently 
return insignificant values in all trace elements of interest.  Over the life of the Project and 
through analyses reported as of the Effective Date, 320 blanks had been inserted in the 
combined stream sediment and soil sample submissions.  Of these there were 3 clear failures 
(Figure 60) all of which resulted from mislabelling a standard as a blank.  Another 70 blanks 
were inserted into core and rock chip sample submissions.  There was single failure with one 
blank returning 20 ppb gold.  Control charts for multiple elements in blanks are provided in 
Appendix 2.

Figure 60.  Results of 62 blanks returned with rock chip samples (including core) and  

253 blanks returned with stream sediment and soil samples   

One blank failed for gold among those submitted with rock chips.  Three appeared to fail in the case of the 
stream sediment samples, but each of those clearly resulted from an error in having a standard inserted while it 
was recorded as a blank.  The apparent difference in results reported by the two labs is entirely related to 
differing detection limits. 
 
 
 
11.2.3  DUPLICATES 
 
Aurania inserted duplicate samples approximately every 35th sample in both stream sediment 
and soil sampling programs.  The duplicates were field duplicates with two samples taken 
from the same site.  The variance between two samples collected from the same location is a 
combination of the variance between the samples collected, the variance between two pulps 
made from the same sample and the variance of two analyses from the same pulp.  The 
variance decreases across each step.  Plots of duplicates versus original samples, whether 
from soil or stream sediment samples, show, for the most part, excellent correlation 
(Figure 61).  Duplicate analysis for gold in both soils and stream sediments is meaningless 
with most samples at the detection limit.  Duplicate results for silver, arsenic, antimony, 
copper, molybdenum, lead, and zinc for both soils and stream sediments are presented in 
Appendix 3. 
 
Results from duplicate sampling indicate that Aurania can decrease the frequency of taking 
field duplicates with the Author recommending 1 sample duplicated out of 80.

11.3  SECURITY 

Stream sediment, soil and rock chip samples are stored at the Macas office which has 24-hour 
gated security.  Samples are delivered to the sample preparation facility, in either Quito or 
Cuenca, by Aurania personnel in vehicles and drivers contracted by Aurania.  Core samples 
are stored at the gated and guarded core logging facility near Patuca with samples for assay 
delivered to the MSALABS facility in Cuenca.

12.  DATA VERIFICATION 
 
 
12.1  DRILLING 

Aurania, prior to the Effective Date, completed a scout drilling program at the Crunchy Hill 
Target, and drilling is underway at Yawi.  Drilling is covered in Section 10.  The program at 
Crunchy Hill totalled 3,204.29 m of diamond core in 9 holes.  Of this total, 2,171 m was 
HTW core (71 mm diameter core size) and 1,033 m NTW core (56 mm diameter core size).  
Aurania sampled 1,087.74 m of core producing 624 samples.  In the drill program that is 
underway at Yawi, 931.02 m has been drilled with HTW and 938.92 m with NTW. 
 
Review of Aurania's drill hole database and logs for Crunchy Hill shows them to be robust 
and reliable.  Aurania's logging practice follows what would be expected for drilling off a 
resource (e.g. collecting RQD and density data).  In all aspects the data collection goes 
beyond what is necessary for an early stage drill program.   
 
12.1.1  DRILL HOLE COLLAR VERIFICATION 
 
The Author recorded UTM coordinates, with a Garmin GPSmap 60CSx handheld GPS unit, at 
the collars of four drill holes at Crunchy Hill.  The coordinates match within the 4 m margin 
of error for the device (Table 10).  Elevations did not match as closely but this is not unusual 
with handheld units GPS units.

12.1.2  DRILL CORE ASSAY VERIFICATION 
 
The Author selected, and supervised, the collection of 5 core intervals from 5 holes to check 
analytical results from intervals with apparent mineralization (calcite veining or breccias).  
The sample intervals matched those taken by Aurania.  Aurania's samples were composed of 
half the core while the WGM samples were from cutting the remaining core in half again and 
taking half of that (a "quarter core" sample).  Ideally, the entire remaining half of the core 
would be sampled to produce a true duplicate.  However, for the purpose of this Report, 
where the objective is to verify the assays received by Aurania, the quarter core samples are 
adequate.  Results (Table 11) show the WGM assays match well those obtained by Aurania.  
For the lone exception, zinc, in the sample from Hole CH-2019-04, both values are still far 
below levels of economic interest. 
 

TABLE 11.   
RESULTS FROM DUPLICATE CORE SAMPLING 

 
 
 
12.2  GEOCHEMICAL DATA VERIFICATION 

Robert Page supervised collection of a single stream sediment sample taken at the same site as 
Aurania sample W369273.  Except for gold, results for all elements from the WGM sample 
match the values obtained from Aurania's sample (Table 12).  The excellent match between 
the coarse fraction of the WGM sample (-20+80 mesh) and the fine fraction (-80 mesh) of the 
same sample suggest it will be worth preparing and analysing more duplicate pairs where one 
is from the coarse fraction and one from the fine fraction.  If the relationship between the 
coarse and fine fractions seen in WGM008 is typical, Aurania's sampling teams could speed 
up the stream sediment sampling program by not having to preserve the -80-mesh fraction.  
Aurania reports that preserving this fine fraction typically requires 30-90 minutes per sample.  
Collecting sample WGM008 took 90 minutes including more than 30 minutes decanting 
water from the -80 mesh fraction.  Of potentially greater interest is the big difference in gold 
values between the two size fractions of the WGM sample.  The result at a minimum indicates 
further investigation on size fractions to be collected and whether a coarser size fraction 
possibly provides a better indication of the presence of gold.

20.  ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMIT, AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

 
20.1  ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING 

The Author is unaware of any environmental liabilities on the Property.  The Project lies 
within the Kutukú-Shaime Protected Forest, which limits the number of drill pads that may be 
permitted within a concession during the Initial Exploration phase to 20 pads, each no more 
than 6 m by 6 m in area.  Additionally, within a Protected Forest, consultation with surface 
rights holders is mandated.  In practice this is no different from permitting outside a Protected 
Forest since Aurania's practice is to always seek landowner permission before undertaking 
any exploration.  The following, provided by Aurania to the Author, describes the various 
permits required for exploration in Ecuador. 
 
20.1.1  ENVIRONMENTAL REGISTRATION 
 
An Environmental Registration ("ER", "Registro Ambiental") is required for the four-year 
Initial Exploration period.  The application for the ER requires information from two areas as 
follows: 

• Background information relating to the Property including:  
o Nature of the corporate entity holding title to the concessions;  
o Ecosystem (inventory of flora and fauna);  
o Proposed exploration plans;  
o Resources the company plans to use (e.g. diesel, water, electricity);  
o Estimated environmental impact of the planned work;  
o Estimated quantity and nature of waste that would be generated; and  
o A reconnaissance exploration plan.  (Reconnaissance exploration includes stream 

sediment, soil sampling, excavation of trenches and associated rock chip or channel 
sampling);  

 
• An Environmental Management Plan ("EMP") describing:  

o Details of the plans and procedures to control, prevent or mitigate environmental 
impacts; and  

o A timeline and budget to carry out the plan.   

 
The Ministry of the Environment granted an ER for Initial Exploration for the Project on 
June 30, 2017.  An updated ER, explicitly including scout drilling as defined in an updated 
EMP, was granted on June 10, 2019.  The EMP includes plans for a maximum of 20 drill pads 
per concession, the maximum allowed per concession within a Protected Forest area.  The 
Environmental Registration file number for the Project is MAE-RA-2017-304737. 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 121 - 

New legislation introduced in 2019 requires a bond be posted as a guarantee to cover the risk 
of environmental impact as identified in the EMP.  ESA has posted a US$42,107.25 bond for 
the Project.  Should environmental impacts be mitigated, the bond is released on completion 
of Initial Exploration. 
 
20.1.2  ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE 
 
Advanced Exploration activities, such as systematic or resource delineation drilling, or the 
construction of semi-permanent camp infrastructure, requires an Environmental License 
("Licencia Ambiental").  The application includes a detailed environmental study and a 
detailed plan that includes environmental controls as well as prevention and mitigation 
measures to be implemented.  Processing and approval of an Environmental License should 
take six months, but in practice typically takes 18 months.  It is likely that the 42 concessions 
that constitute the current Project area will be divided into smaller project areas each of which 
consists of a cluster of concessions that have been reduced in size to cover specific targets that 
would enter the next four-year Advanced Exploration phase.  An Environmental License 
would be required for Advanced Exploration of each concession cluster.   
 
20.1.3  MINE DEVELOPMENT 
 
An Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") is required to permit mine development.  The 
EIA is a detailed, multidisciplinary study identifying and evaluating potential environmental 
impacts and defines preventative and corrective measures to minimize those impacts.  
Environmental audits by the Ministry of the Environment provide a means for assessing the 
effectiveness of the control measures proposed in the EIA. 

 
20.2  WATER PERMITTING AND HEALTH 

20.2.1  "IMPACT ON WATER" CERTIFICATE 
 
Article 26 of the Mining Law requires a certification of there being no impact on water 
resources from the National Secretariat of Water, SENAGUA, the "Certificado de no 
afectacion del agua", which must be obtained before commencing drilling.  The application 
includes verification by an independent consultant that the proposed draw-points for drilling 
are not upstream of draw-points for water used for human consumption. 
 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 122 - 

20.2.2  PERMIT TO USE WATER 
 
On receipt of the Impact on Water Certificate, an application is submitted to SENAGUA for a 
permit to use water from the environment ("Permiso de Aprovechamiento Productivo de 
Agua").  The application includes a technical memorandum that provides data on the 
adequacy of the water source, including flowrate measured over several months, as well as 
contingencies and back-up plans to minimize the risk of contamination.  The memorandum 
includes information as to ownership of the land from which the water is to be taken.  The 
application also stipulates the amount of water to be used, lists any additives used in the drill 
water, and their characteristics.  Detailed plans for water recycling, including the control 
measures and purification procedures to be implemented before water is discharged back into 
the environment, are required.   
 
SENAGUA personnel inspect the sites and deliver an official notice to the owners of the land 
on which each proposed draw-point is located.  The owners of the land have a period in which 
to oppose the use of water from their land.  If there is no opposition from the landowners, 
SENAGUA sends an opinion to the Regulatory Agency of Water Control (ARCA - "Agencia 
de Regulacion y Control del Agua") in Quito, which provides a Certificate of Availability of 
Water ("Certificado de Disponibilidad de Caudal").  This Certificate is sent to the SENAGUA 
office in Macas to be forwarded to the Sub-Secretariat of Water in Cuenca for final approval.   
  
A baseline study of water quality in streams from which water is proposed to be used for 
scout drilling is based on tests undertaken at 3-week intervals, ideally over a period of 
6 months.  Water quality is monitored during drilling, and periodically after, with results 
reported to SENAGUA. 
 
The application for the Impact on Water Certificate for scout drilling at Crunchy Hill was 
lodged with SENAGUA on November 7, 2017 and the Permit to Use Water was granted on 
March 18, 2019.  The permit for scout drilling at Yawi was submitted on March 14, 2019 and 
was granted on August 13, 2019. 
 
20.2.3  HEALTH AND SANITATION 
 
Contaminated water, poor sanitation, and poor hygiene are the prime health risks to people 
living and working in the Project area.  Aurania is investing in basic sanitation education and 
water purification methods to improve general living standards.  The company created the 
Technical Water Group ("TWG") as part of its investment in protecting water sources, 
improving basic sanitation, and expanding water purification.  The TWG has completed 
preliminary assessments of water quality in ten communities within the area of influence of 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019

the Project.  Potable water has been provided in one community and clean water in another.  
The objective is to investigate possible solutions to health-related issues identified, and to 
develop budgets to be presented to regional government, foundations and communities to find 
a means of financing, implementing and making potable water available to communities in 
the Project area. 
 
20.3  COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND SOCIAL IMPACT 

The Author had limited community relations discussions with Aurania's consultants, Toronto-
based O-Trade, and discussions with affected communities were beyond the scope of the site 
visits.  This section has been provided by Aurania with limited editing by the Author.  It is the 
Author's view that the community relations program being carried out by Aurania and its 
consultants is professionally run.  Aurania's track record for gaining approval to access 
multiple target areas provides confirmation of this view. 
 
Ecuador is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, among others.  Approximately 69% of the 
Project lies within land of indigenous communities, while 5% belongs to non-Indigenous 
people.  The remaining 26% of the Project area lies within State land administered by the 
Ministry of the Environment.  The Company conducts its operations in compliance with these 
principles, which is critical to the future of the Project. 
 
The Company's CSR team, under the guidance of O-Trade, has developed a Social 
Management Plan ("SMP") to manage and mitigate social risk.  The SMP includes early 
stakeholder engagement, social impact analysis, and defines partnerships with the Ecuadorian 
government.  Specifically, the Company is working with the ministries of the Environment, 
Health, Agriculture and Education, in addition to its normal-course interaction with the 
MENRNR.   
 
Formal access agreements have been established with 70% of communities within the Project 
area.  Improved access and infrastructure associated with the Company's exploration efforts 
has benefitted nine communities directly and 21 indirectly.  Since inception of the Project, the 
exploration team has created over 1,300 part-time work opportunities, equitably distributed 
across 37 communities.  Scout drilling at Crunchy Hill in Q1 2019 resulted in part-time work 
for approximately 400 men and women and approximately the same number are associated 
with the ongoing scout drilling at Yawi.

23.  ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
 
Other than limited artisanal placer mining in streams and rivers around the margins of the 
Cordillera de Cutucú, there is no mining activity adjacent to the Property.  To the south, in the 
Cordillera del Cóndor, there is significant exploration and development activity on numerous 
precious metal and base metal prospects and deposits.  These, with one exception, are not 
immediately adjacent to the Property.  However, the presence of such a well mineralized belt 
in the Cordillera del Cóndor is significant under the assumption that the geology of that 
cordillera continues along a geological trend into the Cordillera de Cutucú.  Much more work 
is required to verify that this assumption is valid.  Roa (2017) covers the deposits and geology 
of the Cordillera del Cóndor in more detail than will be provided below and the reader is 
referred to that report for detail.   
 
Figure 62, from Roa (2017), shows the large number of prospects and deposits in the 
Cordillera del Cóndor.  Most of these are either genetically related to the Zamora Batholith 
(Nambija, Santa Barbara, Mirador, San Carlos, Panantza, and Warintza) or spatially related 
(Fruta del Norte and multiple other epithermal gold prospects).  With respect to the porphyry 
setting, the presence of the Zamora Batholith is probably critical.  The metals in these deposits 
likely came from metal-rich magmatic fluids streaming off the cooling batholith.  Exposures 
indicating the presence of a comparable intrusive body in the Cordillera de Cutucú are 
limited.  However, the airborne magnetic survey indicates that the Cordillera de Cutucú is 
underlain by several batholithic sized intrusions at shallow depth.   
 
Fruta del Norte stands out as the discovery of most import with respect to gold potential in the 
Project area.  Fruta del Norte hosts a large, intermediate sulphidation epithermal deposit with 
high-grade gold.  Indicated Resources are 23.8 Mt @ 9.61 g/t gold for 7.35 Moz gold, and 
Inferred Resources are 11.6 Mt @ 5.69 g/t gold for 2.13 Moz gold (Lundin Gold, 2019).  The 
deposit demonstrates the potential of the region for large gold deposits and for these deposits 
to be blind to surface.  The resource data provided on the Fruta del Norte deposit have been 
obtained from information provided by other companies and the Author has been unable to 
verify the accuracy of that information, nor is the information necessarily indicative of any 
mineralization that may lie in the Lost Cities - Cutucú Project area.

SolGold PLC's Coangos Project lies immediately to the south of the Cutucú Project.  
Coangos is an early stage project which SolGold describes as having potential for porphyry 
copper-gold deposits.  Target generation at Coangos has produced two areas of mineralized 
outcrops with copper carbonate and copper oxide on fractures and chalcocite and chalcopyrite 
on fresh surfaces.  Exposure of continuous mineralization has been documented along 120 m 
in one stream bed (SolGold Corporate Presentation August 2019 for Australian Diggers and 
Dealers, p. 42).

24.  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
 
No other relevant data are presented here.  Section 16.2 of Roa (2017) - Other Relevant Data - 
includes a detailed summary on the archival research carried out by Keith Barron and 
Professor Octavio Latorre documenting pre-18th century gold discoveries made by the 
Colonial Spanish, and their location.  The impetus for the research was the Nambija gold 
skarn which was mined by the Colonial Spanish, but was subsequently lost for centuries.  The 
deposits were rediscovered in 1981 by a hunting party and shortly thereafter exploited by 
artisanal miners.  The research sought to determine if other early gold mines had also been 
reclaimed by the jungle and remained open for rediscovery.  Multiple references in archives in 
Quito, Lima, Spain, the Vatican and Washington D.C.  indicated the Spanish produced gold 
from two mines in the Cordillera de Cutucú the "Lost Cities" of Logroño de los Caballeros 
and Sevilla de Oro.  This information was highly relevant in 2017 but over the past two years 
results received from extensive data collected in the field are replacing archival research in 
significance to the future of the Project.

25.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
Aurania's Lost Cities – Cutucú Project consists of 42 mineral concessions granted to 
Aurania's wholly owned Ecuadorian subsidiary, EcuaSolidus, in December 2016.  All 
42 concessions are in good standing as of the Effective Date.  The majority of the Property 
lies within the 344,002 Ha Kutukú-Shaime Protected Forest area in which, despite the 
designation, mineral exploration and exploitation are permitted and the designation has had 
minimal impact on Aurania's ability to obtain the requisite permits to carry out exploration 
across the Property.  To date Aurania has all required permits for exploration of the Property 
and has reached access agreements with multiple indigenous communities within the 
Project area. 
 
The Project is easily accessible from Quito on well-maintained highways.  However, within 
the Property, access is poor requiring travel by foot on forest paths through rugged, densely 
vegetated terrain.  Rainfall is high year-round, totaling 2-3 m annually.  The combination of 
poor access, mountainous topography, dense vegetation, and high rainfall presents challenges 
to exploration, but these factors also account for the lack of modern exploration and the 
current opportunity.   
 
The Project is located on-trend to the north of the well mineralized Cordillera del Cóndor - 
host to the Fruta del Norte gold deposit and multiple copper porphyries.  Aurania's 
expectation is that the Cordillera de Cutucú has potential for the discovery of similar deposits.   
   
Aurania has carried out a Property-wide airborne magnetic and radiometric survey and is in 
the process of completing coverage of the Property with a stream sediment sampling program.  
The combined work has highlighted potential for multiple deposit types including the 
expected epithermal precious metal and porphyry copper types.  However, the strongest 
mineralization found to date has been sedimentary-hosted copper-silver in sandstone and 
shale and silver-zinc-lead replacements in limestones.  The copper mineralization is found in 
several stacked, reduced horizons within a red-bed sequence in the Jurassic Chapiza 
Formation.  The limestone replacements, which could be any of MVT, Irish, or CRD type, are 
found in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic Santiago Formation.   
 
25.1  GOLD-SILVER 

The program has yet to rediscover one of the gold deposits, dating from the Colonial Spanish 
era, that archival research indicated could be present in the Project area.  However, Aurania's 
stream sediment sampling, followed by soil sampling, have returned significant arsenic, 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019

antimony, mercury and thallium anomalies.  These pathfinder element anomalies have begun 
to delineate multiple low and/or intermediate sulphidation epithermal alteration systems 
spanning three areas, each in excess of 50 km², with potential to host precious metal deposits.  
No significant gold anomalies have yet been identified by surface sampling in the broader 
Latorre target area, while at Apai, pan concentrate samples yielded gold values that are 
refining the target area there.  At Tiria West a coherent gold in soils anomaly has been 
detected and Aurania has prioritized further sampling for that area.   
 
Whether for gold or silver, the exploration model going forward on the three aerially 
extensive pathfinder anomalies identified to date, Latorre, Apai, and Tiria, presumes that the 
present level of erosion has not reached the potential bonanza grade level for gold and silver.  
As of the Effective Date, scout drilling has been undertaken on the Crunchy Hill target and is 
on-going on the Yawi target, both of which lie within the large epithermal alteration system 
defined by the Latorre cluster of geochemical anomalies.  That drilling failed to intersect 
significant gold or silver values.  However, results were compatible with the exploration 
model which has precious metal mineralization occurring below the 600 m elevation amsl. 
 
25.2  COPPER 

Aurania's work has identified potential for copper deposits in the form of the originally 
expected porphyry type, but also in the form of sedimentary-hosted and possible IOCG types.  
As of the Effective Date, the strongest copper mineralization is of the sedimentary-hosted 
style with multiple percent copper at surface.  Each of these three styles of copper 
mineralization are discussed below. 
 
25.2.1  PORPHYRY COPPER 
 
Geophysical consultant, Jeremy Brett's interpretation of airborne magnetic data, using 
multiple processing techniques, identified 64 magnetic anomalies potentially related to 
porphyry copper deposits of which he ranked 31 as high priority for follow-up (Brett, 2019).   
 
Stream sediment sampling returned anomalies in copper from these broad high priority 
magnetic anomalies (e.g. Kirus, Jempe, and Tsenken), with molybdenum and other pathfinder 
elements from some.  The relationship between these targets and the adjacent to overlapping 
sedimentary-hosted copper-silver targets is being investigated through detailed field work.  
Aurania's current interpretation is that stratabound, sedimentary-hosted copper-silver 
mineralization extends over a large area, overlying, and/or intruded by, porphyry and IOCG 
systems. 
 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 131 - 

Field work has identified or confirmed the following porphyry targets: 
 
• Soil sampling identified enrichment in copper over the Tsenken N2 target, a magnetic 

anomaly interpreted to represent the core of a mineralized porphyry system.  QSP 
alteration has also been identified at Tsenken N2.  Soil sampling is underway on the 
Tsenken N3, a similar target located 1.5 km to the north of Tsenken N2; and 

• Awacha exhibits extensive QSP alteration over two distinct clusters of magnetic features 
in Pumbuiza Formation slates, quartzites and conglomerates.  Weak potassic alteration 
(secondary biotite) also occurs in diorite dykes cutting the Pumbuiza.  These porphyry 
targets have coincident copper and molybdenum stream sediment anomalies.  The values 
(<65 ppm copper and <45 ppm molybdenum) are not indicative of stream sediment 
anomalies from an outcropping deposit, although one rock-chip sample with chalcocite 
assayed 0.3% copper and 0.2 g/t gold.  No significant stockwork veining has been 
identified in the limited work undertaken on the target to date.   

   
25.2.2  SEDIMENTARY-HOSTED COPPER-SILVER 
 
The most significant copper mineralization; and many rock samples have returned multiple 
percent copper values, is of sedimentary-hosted copper type.  Aurania has begun to define 
what it terms the Kirus-Jempe Basin which covers a 23 km long by 7 km wide belt of strong 
copper anomalies in a Mid- to Late Jurassic, 2,400 m thick sequence of red-beds (mudstone, 
siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate) of the Chapiza Formation.  The basin margins are 
defined by north-northwest trending faults which were inverted prior to an onlap in the 
Cretaceous.  The red-beds are gently folded, with the amplitude of folds increasing in 
proximity to the inverted faults.  Reduced beds that contain abundant, carbonized plant 
fragments are reported by Aurania to be 0.1 m to 2.5 m thick and occur locally within the red-
bed sequence.  The chemically reduced beds are the main host of copper-silver mineralization.   
 
25.2.3  IOCG 
 
Copper, associated with sodic alteration of gabbroic diorite that intrudes red-beds of the 
Chapiza Formation, has been identified in a 100 m wide dyke on the western margin of the 
Tsenken magnetic feature.  This copper-silver mineralization is potentially of the IOCG style.   
 

25.3  SILVER-ZINC-LEAD 

Stream sediment sampling identified a north-northwest - trending barium and silver anomaly 
measuring 12 km by 3 km constituting the Shimpia target.  Strongly anomalous levels of lead 
and zinc were returned in soil sampling of the southeastern and northwestern parts of this 
silver-barium anomaly.  Rock chip samples from outcrop and boulders both returned multiple 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 132 - 

potentially economic values in silver, zinc and lead.  All mineralization is in the form of 
limestone replacements which, in detail, either show barite veins with semi-massive galena 
and sphalerite, or crackle breccias with sphalerite, galena, pyrite and quartz fillings.   
 
The style of mineralization is compatible with Irish or CRD type lead-zinc-silver deposits.   
 
25.4  PROTOCOLS AND DATA VERIFICATION 

The Author has reviewed Aurania's protocols for collecting samples of all types, through 
insertion of control samples, to incorporation of geochemical analyses from ALS Global and 
MSALABS into the Project database.  The protocols are well defined and Aurania's QA/QC 
protocols go beyond what is necessary for an early stage exploration program.  There have 
been few QA/QC failures despite having to track data from 9 elements (gold, silver, arsenic, 
copper, mercury, molybdenum, lead, antimony and zinc).  Most failures were found to be 
mislabeling of blanks and standards.  Aurania, in reviewing those failures, determined no 
reanalysis was required.  Any error resulting from not resolving a QA/QC failure are 
insignificant at this early stage of exploration.  None of the samples of any type will be 
incorporated in a resource estimate and no sample result within a batch having a QA/QC 
failure could potentially mislead the market in a material way.   
 
Lastly, data verification, including comparison of results from select laboratory certificates 
and drill logs, with the Aurania geochemical or drill hole Excel databases, found no errors.  In 
the Author's opinion, Aurania's databases, maps, and reports can be relied upon. 
 
25.5  ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL 

Environmental management and community relations are vital to the Project as problems with 
either could result in the Project being delayed or halted.  The Author does not have relevant 
experience in either matter and depended on discussions with Aurania's personnel and 
Aurania's community relations consultants.  Aurania is clearly giving due attention on both 
fronts.  Receipt of permits to carry out work within the Protected Forest, combined with 
access agreements having been reached with over half the indigenous Shuar communities in 
the Project area, indicate that Aurania is successfully managing permitting and community 
relations.   
 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 133 - 

Any mineral exploration project can be impacted either positively or negatively by significant 
national level political or social events that are largely out of the control of the company 
operating the project.  A project in Ecuador is no exception.  In the case of Ecuador, Aurania 
does have support from the bilateral trade agreement between Ecuador and Canada.  Although 
Ecuador withdrew from the agreement in 2017, it is the opinion of Aurania's Ecuadorian legal 
counsel that the terms of the agreement are in effect for 15 years following the termination of 
the agreement. 
 
25.6  OVERALL 

Aurania's approach to exploring the Cordillera de Cutucú is sound, progressing from the 
airborne survey and stream sediment sampling to highlight anomalous areas, and following up 
on those with detailed soil sampling, prospecting, and geological mapping to select initial drill 
targets.  Aurania's protocols are robust and the data produced from its exploration program 
can be depended upon.  If any significant precious or base metal deposit outcrops on the 
Property, Aurania's program is likely to identify it.  Should one or more significant deposits, 
blind to the surface, be present, Aurania's approach could lead to discovery with sufficient 
commitment in time, funding, drilling and human resources.

26.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
26.1  GENERAL 

The highest priorities for Aurania are: 
 
• Complete stream sediment sampling across the entire Property in order to: 
 

o Potentially identify waste dumps associated with the historic gold mines of Logroño 
and Sevilla; 

o Continue to identify and rank targets for epithermal gold-silver; 
o Identify extensions to sedimentary-hosted copper-silver; 
o Identify and rank additional targets for intrusive-related copper (porphyry and IOCG); 

and 

o Determine where reductions in the size of the Property can be made to lower the 
annual holding cost. 

 
• Building support for the Project locally and especially with indigenous Shuar communities 

- the Project will be difficult to advance to mine development without that support. 
 
• Continue to involve world-class consultants on each specific target type to critically assess 

the exploration programs and provide guidance for further exploration.  To the Effective 
Date, Prof. Gregor Borg, one of the top specialists on sedimentary-hosted copper in the 
Central African Copperbelt and the Kupferschiefer, and Prof. Jeffrey Hedenquist, one of 
the top authorities on epithermal gold-silver deposits, have consulted on site in late 2019. 

 
• Secure a partner or partners to allow Aurania to concurrently advance exploration on 

multiple district-scale targets.  The objective is to not lose what might be key concessions 
for failure to meet mandated investment deadlines.  Ideally, for continuity, Aurania should 
maintain control over all exploration programs including community relations. 

 
 
 
  



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 135 - 

26.2  PROTOCOLS 

Aurania's protocols are well designed and, if anything, go beyond what is necessary for an 
early stage exploration project.  Having these established protocols in place prepares the team 
for such time as advanced exploration begins on one or more targets.  The Author has some 
recommendations as follows: 
 
• Aurania's field protocol for collecting stream sediment samples is designed to produce a 

high quality -80 mesh sample but requires up to 90 minutes of field time per sampling 
team.  There is a possibility, as indicated by the lone sample collected for WGM, that the 
+80 -20 mesh size fraction is equally representative and will take much less time to 
collect.  The Author recommend that Aurania select 20-30 stream sediment sample sites,  
to include sampling drainages crossing epithermal, sedimentary-hosted copper, and 
intrusion related copper target areas, and take three samples at each location for 
comparison of results from each as follows:   
 
o -80 mesh fraction; 
o +80 – 20 mesh fraction; and  
o A pan concentrate. 

 
The results should assist Aurania in deciding if the stream sediment sampling protocol 
should be modified. 

 
• In reviewing drill core from the Crunchy Hill program, R. Page noted that sample tags 

taped to the sides of core trays marking the start and end of sample intervals were peeling 
off.  The Author recommends stapling the tags to the sides of the core trays. 

 
• At such time as one or more target areas move to advanced exploration, the protocol for 

responding to standard or blank failures will need to be formalized with whichever assay 
laboratory Aurania is using. 

 
• Results from Aurania's duplicate sampling in the soil and stream sediment programs show 

very good correlations and the frequency of taking field duplicates can be reduced.

26.3  TARGET-SPECIFIC  

Aurania's approach to advancing exploration across the Property is sound.  This calls for 
completing the initial stream sediment phase to identify large geochemically anomalous areas.  
These anomalies would be advanced to drill targeting through ridge and spur soil sampling 
followed by detailed grid soil sampling, mapping of stream beds, prospecting and detailed 
geophysics.   
  
One approach to the exploration of a large region such as Aurania's 208,000 Ha concession 
block, is to complete detailed targeting of an entire region or target cluster such as the Latorre 
area, which is many tens of square kilometres in extent, before starting scout drilling of the 
prioritized sequence of targets.  The approach selected by Aurania, in contrast, is to rapidly 
advance to scout drilling as each target is identified and ranked against the targets that have 
been studied in detail at that time.  The latter approach was selected because of the lack of 
outcrop due to dense jungle and deep soil cover, so that the geology and alteration 
encountered in scout drilling on one target can be used to rapidly refine other targets in the 
same region, likely resulting in a shift in their priority ranking for subsequent scout drilling.   
Carrying out the detailed targeting work over an entire cluster of anomalies should be 
considered in a case like the Latorre area.  Here drill testing of a small area at Crunchy Hill 
failed to produce a precious metal intercept of significance.  Aurania should consider the 
merits of continued drilling at Crunchy Hill to test an exploration model with the target below 
an altitude of 600 m amsl versus the priority of developing new targets within the cluster. 
 
Providing details of proposed exploration of each stream sediment or airborne geophysical 
anomaly identified to date is beyond the scope of this Report.  Provided below are 
descriptions of work that the Author believes reasonable to advance exploration in each of the 
different types of targets.   
 
26.3.1  EPITHERMAL PRECIOUS METAL TARGET AREAS 
 
Aurania should continue with its current approach of stream sediment sampling to identify 
significant geochemical anomalies within the Property.  As of the Effective Date, stream 
sediment sampling has not identified a large coherent gold anomaly.  As has been done, 
anomalies identified in pathfinder and volatile elements should be soil sampled and 
prospected.  For the epithermal precious metal anomalies generated by the stream sediment 
sampling program, the targeting procedure might include: 
 
1. Ridge and spur soil sampling and prospecting across the entire anomaly. 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 137 - 

2. Detailed grid soil sampling (200 m by 50 m grid – orientation of lines to be determined on 
a case by case basis). 

3. Complete geological mapping of creeks concurrent with the above. 

4. Scout drill as warranted on the basis of results of prospecting, mapping, and geochemical 
sampling. 

5. If drilling encounters significant mineralization, apply to convert the concession to 
Advanced Exploration status and expand the drill program. 

6. If the scout drilling fails to encounter mineralization of interest: 
a. Move on to the next scout drilling target area as defined by work covered in point 4 

above; or 
b. Initiate detailed targeting work to improve the exploration model.  The targeting work 

might include ground geophysics as recommended by an experienced geophysicist. 
 
26.3.2  SEDIMENTARY-HOSTED COPPER-SILVER 
 
Work to date has demonstrated the presence of potentially economic grade copper-silver 
mineralization (copper carbonate, oxides and chalcocite) over 23 km of strike in multiple, 
reduced beds characterized by abundant carbonized plant fragments in the Chapiza 
Formation.  Aurania now needs to: 
 
1. Demonstrate that this mineralization which, in hand sample can run to multiple percent 

copper, can be present over a thickness of several metres.  Confirming this will be done by 
some combination of: 
• finding the mineralized zone outcropping continuously in a creek bed; 
• trenching where safe and feasible; and 
• drilling with a small man-portable rig. 

 
2. Locate potentially important mineralizing structures that might control the location of 

thicker zones of mineralization: 
• from mapping; 
• from satellite image analysis; or 
• from LiDAR or DEM. 

 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 138 - 

3. Show that mineralized horizons can be continuous over significant strike lengths, without 
being severely folded or disrupted by faulting, through: 
• mapping; and 
• detailed soil sampling on samples collected every 25 m on lines spaced 50 m apart 

(lines can be short if mapping has confined the possible location of the mineralized 
strata). 

 
4. Drill test best zones identified by the above. 
 
26.3.3  PORPHYRY COPPER 
 
An outcropping mineralized porphyry should not be missed by a stream sediment survey in 
terrain like that of the Cordillera de Cutucú.  While a potential porphyry system has been 
indicated at Awacha, the copper-molybdenum values in stream sediment samples from the 
area are lower than would be expected from an outcropping deposit.  These results are 
consistent with the QSP alteration mapped at surface, combined with the lack of stockwork 
veining, that would suggest that an associated mineralized zone of a porphyry would lie at 
depth.  The occurrence of significant gold (0.2g/t) with minor copper mineralization (0.3%) in 
a grab sample, highlights the potential of the Awacha target to contain copper-gold 
mineralization.  Detailed exploration, including detailed geophysical surveys, could be 
considered at Awacha to develop and enhance the porphyry target concept.  The Author 
recommends delaying that work until the stream sediment program is completed over the 
entire Property.  A higher priority porphyry target may yet be found, up to and including an 
outcropping copper-gold deposit.   
 
A coherent copper anomaly in soil over a discrete, second-order magnetic anomaly and 
coincident QSP alteration of a diorite, suggests that the Tsenken N2 anomaly constitutes a 
porphyry copper target that will be ranked against other similar targets before further detailed 
exploration and scout drilling is done.   
 
26.3.4  IOCG     
 
The occurrence of sodic alteration associated with copper-silver mineralization of subvolcanic 
intrusive rocks highlights the potential for IOCG deposits related to the continental 
extensional environment in which red-beds of the Chapiza Formation accumulated.  
Exploration for IOCGs is similar to that recommended for porphyries above. 
 



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 139 - 

26.3.5  SILVER-ZINC-LEAD  
 
One of the better-defined geochemical anomalies on the Property is the north-northwest  
trending, 12 km by 3 km Shimpia silver-zinc-lead anomaly defined by the stream sediment 
program and enhanced by rock chip sampling.  Additional mapping and prospecting are 
warranted to advance this target to scout drilling.  Since zinc and lead are not core to Aurania, 
it is recommended that a partner be found to explore the target.  Further exploration of the 
target could be undertaken with mineralization models for Irish-type and CRD lead-zinc 
deposits.   
 
WGM strongly recommends that the exploration team be equipped with a Zinc-Zap indicator 
solution for non-sulphide zinc mineralization (Zn-carbonates, hydroxides and silicates) that 
forms in this strongly oxidizing surface environment.  The formulation and storage 
instructions (they are temperature and light-sensitive) for the two solutions that are combined 
to make Zinc Zap are well documented.  The solutions are usually prepared in a commercial 
laboratory.  In field use, the yellow solutions react instantly in the presence of zinc 
mineralization, changing to orange or bright red, depending on zinc content.  The Zn-Zap 
reaction to smithsonite mineralization in the Pucara Basin, Peru is shown in Figure 63.

26.4  PROPERTY MAINTENANCE 

Based on the number of anomalies found to date, a number which will probably grow as 
stream sediment sampling progresses, Aurania will be challenged to meet the timelines 
required by Ecuador to maintain concessions in good standing.  All concessions will need to 
be converted to Advanced Exploration status in approximately one year if they are to remain 
in good standing.  Advancing the single large Project on all fronts, and keeping within 
timelines for maintaining all concessions, will place strain on the human and financial 
resources of a single company.  Aurania should consider sub-dividing the Property into 
multiple smaller concession blocks.  The new properties would be based on target type with 
boundaries defined by underlying geology and associated geochemical anomalies.  Aurania 
would then determine which of these new properties it wishes to advance under the Aurania 
banner, spin out to shareholders as one or more new companies, partner with a third party, or 
sell outright.   
 
26.5  PROPOSED BUDGET 

Regional exploration should continue in order to complete coverage of the remaining 50% of 
the Project area during 2020.  A consideration in recommending a C$9,000,000 budget is the 
need for Aurania to advance the work required to meet timelines set by mining law to 
maintain concessions in good standing.  This scale of budget is additionally justified by the 
number of targets already identified and requiring detailed targeting work and drilling. 
 
Furthermore, new targets are expected to continue to be identified by ongoing stream 
sediment sampling results combined with data from the 2017 airborne geophysical survey.  
The principal means of advancing selected targets will be with soil sampling, detailed 
mapping and sampling of sporadic outcrops and potentially detailed geophysics focused on 
specific targets.  The type of geophysics applied would depend on the nature of the 
mineralization expected.  Due to the steep terrane, thick soil (up to 10 m) and thick vegetation 
cover, trenching is seldom a viable option prior to scout drilling, but may be possible locally.   
 
The recommended C$9,000,000 budget for 2020 has not been broken out in detail in Table 14 
as ongoing results are likely to dictate changes from anything presented here.  Rather funding 
has been broken in two major categories: the first, managing and maintaining the Project; and 
the second, direct exploration activities.  The latter has been broken down not by activity but 
by target type where the split at the start of the year is anticipated to give near equal weighting 
to gold and copper exploration.  As discussed previously, the Shimpia silver-lead-zinc targets 
have technical merit, but Aurania should not focus significant effort on those without outside 
funding from a lead-zinc focussed partner.   



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 141 - 

26.5.1  STREAM SEDIMENT SAMPLING 
 
Approximately 50% of the Property remains to be explored by stream sediment sampling.  In 
2020, the stream sediment program should cover the remaining unsampled parts of the 
Property at a sample density of at least 2.5 samples per km² with an expected average all-in 
cost of $60/sample.  Concurrently, prospecting, regional geological mapping and rock chip 
sampling should be carried out along the same streams and rivers. 
 
26.5.2  SOIL SAMPLING 
 
Ridge and spur soil sampling, followed by grid sampling over anomalous areas identified by 
the ridge and spur sampling, are the primary means of follow-up of stream sediment and 
geophysical targets.  Soil sampling will continue with an estimated 10,500 samples to be 
collected and analysed at an expected all-in cost of $40/sample.   
 
26.5.3  GEOLOGICAL MAPPING AND SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING 
 
Prioritized targets should undergo geological mapping, supported by SWIR spectral analysis, 
rock chip channel sampling with a diamond saw, and where possible, trenching.   
 
26.5.4  DETAILED GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS 
 
A budget is allocated to allow for multiple focused geophysical surveys.  These may include: 
 
• Detailed drone-borne magnetic surveys over intrusive-related and some epithermal 

targets; 

• Induced Polarization surveys to refine resistive areas that may be quartz veins, or areas of 
silicification, and to identify zones with chargeability characteristics of disseminated 
sulphides; and 

• Audio Magnetotelluric or Deep Induced Polarization surveys to better assess deeply 
buried copper porphyry targets. 

 
  



Aurania Resources Ltd. Lost Cities – Cutucú Project, December 21, 2019   

- 142 - 

26.5.5  DRILLING 
 
The program must include a significant amount of drilling to move concessions towards 
Advanced Exploration.  The proposed budget includes 11,200 m of drilling at a forecast all-in 
cost of $250/m.  The anticipated split of drilling between target types has 55% going to test 
epithermal targets, 30% to test sedimentary-hosted copper-silver and 15% to test intrusive-
related copper targets.  As with other types of work above, Aurania needs to be flexible on 
allocation of drill metres between the different target types as work proceeds and target 
priorities change.

BUDGET FOR 2020 IN THE CUTUCÚ - LOST CITIES PROJECT 

(in Canadian Dollars) 

 
 

 
 
In the Author's opinion, the proposed exploration strategy and budget is appropriate for the 
current stage of exploration in the Lost Cities - Cutucú Project, and in consideration of 
timelines mandated under Ecuador's legal regime to maintain Aurania's concessions in good 
standing.
