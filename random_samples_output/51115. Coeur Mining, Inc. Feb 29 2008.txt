SECTION 1 – SUMMARY 
 
Cerro Bayo is owned and operated by Compañía Minera Cerro Bayo Ltd, (CMCB) a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.  CMCB 
operates several underground mines in the 11th region of Chile south of Lake General Carrera.  In 
addition to the Cerro Bayo reserves listed below is mineral purchased from Mina Martha.  This is 
completed under a formal mineral purchase contract between Coeur Argentina (C.A.), and 
CMCB.  This contract is discussed in more detail in Section 18.     
 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves as of Dec 31, 2007 are listed in Table 1 and Table 2. 
The Mineral Resources are additional to the Mineral Reserves and  have not demonstrated 
economic viability. Please note that, due to rounding of the resources and reserves, there may be 
some minor variations in mineral grade.

Mineral Reserves are reported at a cutoff grade of  6.00 EqAu gpt 
 
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve reporting criteria are discussed in detail in Section 17.  
The equivalent grade calculation is discussed in detail in Section 22.   
 
The mine life at Cerro Bayo based on mineral reserves is through 2010.  Annual mine plans are 
prepared to reflect on-going exploration results which have historically found and defined new 
mineralization to more than replace annual mine production. During this time, typical operating 
and exploration activities normally undertaken at underground operations are planned. These 
activities are discussed in more detail in later sections of this report.     
 
Summary economic results are shown in Table 3.  All references to dollars ($) in this technical 
report are to US dollars unless otherwise noted.

The mineral resource and reserve estimates are based on valid exploration data and are 
reasonably estimated using standard engineering practices.  The operation shows significant 
economic viability.  There are no known issues that would materially affect the reported 
resources and reserves.  It is recommended to continue the exploration and mining activities that 
are described in Section 10 and Section 22.

SECTION 4 – PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
The Cerro Bayo District property is located in the XI Region, Chile, approximately 130 km south 
of Coyhaique, the capital of the region.  Region XI is an emerging precious metals province in 
the sparsely populated southern Aysén region of southern Chile.  The most important operating 
mines in the region are Cerro Bayo and the El Toqui Mine.  Several exploration projects are 
being operated by various companies in the area, including several across the border in 
Argentina.  The region offers no impediments to exploration and mining.  Year-round access is 
available to highways, ocean ports, and energy.  Industrial services are readily available. 
  
The 27,806 hectare (Ha) property is located 25 km west of the town of Chile Chico, on the 
southern shore of Lago General Carrera and is accessed by a well-maintained public gravel road.  
The project lies on the east side of the Andes mountain range at moderate elevations ranging 
from 180 m to 1,400 m.  The property location is shown in Figure 1.

Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 13 of 131 

Concessions (Pedimentos).  There are several other exploitation mineral concessions located on 
the southeast margins of the concessions owned by CMCB. 
 
The current mining activities of CMCB are centered at the Cerro Bayo and Laguna Verde 
sectors. Exploratory underground activities are being conducted at the Cascada vein system, 
located south of Cerro Bayo. All these areas are fully protected by the mining concessions owned 
by the CMCB.   
 
In addition, CMCB fully owns 25,400 Ha of exploration concessions and patented mining claims 
(Concesiones de Explotacion o Mensuras) located south of Cerro Bayo in the XI Region of 
Chile, which protect areas with exploration potential. 
 
The Exploitation Concessions at Cerro Bayo have been fully staked according to Chilean legal 
regulations.  The Exploration Concessions in the district were granted on December 16, 2003, 
and are in the process of being turned into exploitation concessions.  Mineral concessions in 
Chile remain valid as long as the annual tax obligation is fulfilled.  According to the Chilean 
Mining Code, the exploration concessions may be turned into exploitation concessions if 
properly requested to the local Court before the expiry date. 
 
There are no known liens or encumbrances on the mineral concessions owned by CMCB.  Cerro 
Bayo's exploration concessions and patented mining claims are listed in Table 4 and  
Table 5.   
 
The location of mineralized zones, mine workings, and other important features are shown in 
Figure 33 through Figure 36.  Environmental liabilities are discussed in Section 22.

SECTION 5 – ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The closest town to Cerro Bayo is Chile Chico (population 4,000) which is accessible by gravel 
road, charter air service from Balmaceda, and barge service from Puerto Ibáñez on the northern 
side of General Carrera Lake.  Major supplies are transported by truck from the Pacific port of 
Chacabuco to Puerto Ibáñez.  The Cerro Bayo property is located 25 km west of Chile Chico and 
is accessed by a well-maintained gravel road.   
 
The project lies on the east side of the Andes and the climate in the vicinity of Cerro Bayo can be 
characterized as sub-Mediterranean.  The winter months (June to August) are usually mild, with 
minimum temperatures varying from –10° C to 0° C, and wet (light snowfall and rain) in 
comparison with the other months of the year.  The summers are warm and relatively dry, with 
temperatures in the high teens and low 20s.  Average annual precipitation is 293 mm, most of 
which falls as rain.  Due to Cerro Bayo's proximity to General Carrera Lake, the relative 
humidity in the area is generally above 50%.  Although the area is known for its strong westerly 
winds (sometimes exceeding 70 km/hr) the operations have rarely been impacted as a result and 
the mine operates the entire year.  
 
The elevation of the concessions runs from 180 meters to 1,400 meters.  The elevation of the 
Cerro Bayo underground mine is 400 meters.   
 
Infrastructure includes typical requirements for underground and open pit mining and processing 
using a standard flotation circuit and includes: 
Standard flotation mill; 
Crushing plant; 
Tailings dam; 
Office Complex; 
Shop and Warehouse facility; 
Assay Laboratory; and 
Power Generation. 
 
Power generation includes 6 generators with a 1-megawat capacity at the Laguna Verde Plant.  
Three generators are required while the plant is operating, resulting in three generators as 
backup.  Each mining area also has its own power generating capability.   
 
The Cerro Bayo concessions are located on private property owned by Mr. Yamil Nasif Hasen 
Burgos.  CMCB has a renewable contract with Mr. Burgos that allows the company to operate a 
surface or underground mine on the 600 hectares of land that he owns.  The El Baño-Bahia Jara 
concession of 255 hectares is located on private land owned by the Burgos family.  The Cascada 
concessions are located on private property owned by three different owners; the Vásquez family 
with 400 hectares, María Fica Burgos with 581 hectares, and Héctor Crespo Fica with 949 
hectares. 
 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 16 of 131 

A "change of land use" permit has been obtained which allows CMCB to operate the open 
pit/underground mine on 140 hectares of land.  Other concessions are located on CMCB owned 
land and on land owned by other private individuals where the company has been granted 
permission to carry out exploration activities. The surface rights are sufficient for all foreseen 
mining, waste dump, processing, and tailings dam requirements. 
  
Cerro Bayo has requested and received 5 authorizations for obtaining the use of water on the 
concession.  A total of 600 liters per second from Lago General Carrera has been authorized. 
 
Most of the workers for current and continuing operation of the mine are readily available from 
the surrounding area, including the town of Chile Chico. 
 
The surface rights are sufficient for all foreseen mining activities.

SECTION 6 – HISTORY 
 
Gold and Silver mineralization was discovered in the Cerro Bayo District (termed Fachinal at the 
time) in the summer of 1984 by Freeport Chilean Exploration company (FCEC).  Drilling of 
veins and potential bulk-minable stockworks commenced in 1986 and continued until mid 1989.  
Exploration activities were discontinued in August 1989, due to Freeport's decision to terminate 
its Chilean investments.   
 
Early in 1990, Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation acquired FCEC, acquiring extensive 
exploration concessions at Fachinal.  CDE Chilean Mining Corporation, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Coeur d'Alene Mines, resumed evaluation of the area in the second quarter of 
1990, concentrating its efforts on the most promising targets.  Infill and step-out drilling and 
tunneling carried out in the 1990-1993 span delineated an open pit and underground reserve 
base, which led to a feasibility study and a production decision in mid 1994. 
 
Construction of standard flotation mill installations started late 1994 and production started late 
October 1995.  Full production started in January 1996.  Due to declining metal prices and 
depletion of reserves the mine operation was suspended in November 2000.   
 
A drilling program conducted in 2000 before mine suspension outlined a high grade vein system 
near the Cerro Bayo dome located 14 kilometers west of Chile Chico and 12 km east of the mill 
at Laguna Verde.  Coeur spent most of 2001 conducting engineering and economic evaluations 
of this new area.  Additional infill drilling was conducted to confirm the continuity of the near 
surface veins.  Two underground ramps began drifting toward the main Lucero vein starting in 
November 2001.  Mine development pursued and the Laguna Verde processing plant was re-
started in April 2002.   
 
During 2003 production continued from the underground areas, the Furioso open pit, the 
Tranque open pits, as well as from mineral purchased from Mina Martha. Exploration and 
development drilling also continued during 2003.   A pre-feasibility study was completed in 
2003 and 2004 for the expansion of CMCB's operations to include heap leaching.  The decision 
was made to not proceed with heap leaching. 
 
During 2005, production continued from both open pit and underground sources but during 2006 
it was exclusively from underground sources. Historical reported mineral resources and mineral 
reserves are shown in Table 6.  Further explanation of the concepts of equivalent gold 
calculations and cutoff grade may be found in Sections 17 and 22. Production to-date is shown in 
Table 7. In all tables, historical mineral resources are in addition to mineral reserves.

SECTION 7 – GEOLOGIC SETTING 

Regional Geology 
 
The Cerro Bayo District is situated within a 250 km long north-south Mesozoic volcanic belt that 
lies near the boundary between an eastern craton (Patagonian Plateau) and a western magmatic 
arc (Patagonian Cordillera).  Vast amounts of silicic to intermediate calc-alkaline volcanics were 
erupted during Jurassic to Middle Cretaceous time in a sub-aerial, intra-arc to back-arc 
environment and deposited over a Late Paleozoic accretionary basement prism. The volcanic pile 
contains large volumes of rhyolitic to dacitic ash flow tuffs and pyroclastics rocks interpreted to 
be associated with large volcanic structures. Marine sedimentary horizons deposited during 
restricted transgressions that occurred in the Cretaceous and Tertiary are interbedded in places 
with the volcanics. The belt is unconformably overlain by plateau basalts that range in age from 
Early to Late Tertiary.     
 
Intrusive rocks are mainly exposed west from Cerro Bayo. They form the Patagonian Batholith, 
core of the Andes in the region, and intrude Late Paleozoic fore-arc assemblages. The Batholith 
is composed of a variety of granitoids that range in age from Jurassic to Miocene though most 
were emplaced in the Early to Middle Cretaceous. Restricted intrusive bodies have been 
identified east of the Patagonian Batholith and are represented by coeval fine grained porphyries, 
Cretaceous rhyolitic and dacitic domes (such as the Cerro Bayo and Mallines domes), and 
Tertiary dioritic-gabbroic porphyries and plugs. The distribution of plutons in the region suggests 
the magmatic arc had an oscillatory east-west behavior since the Jurassic, a feature that contrasts 
with the typical eastward migration of the central and northern Chile magmatic arc.  
 
Crustal shortening and deformation was less in the Aysén area than in other Andean regions. It 
occurred mainly in the Middle Cretaceous resulting in gentle folds and steep northeast normal 
faults. Major east-west to northeast fracture zones are also important in the region with the 
topography being exaggerated by Pleistocene glacial erosion that modeled the present 
topographic features such as the Lake General Carrera. The largest regional structure is the 
Liquiñe-Ofqui fault, a large transform zone that controlled the emplacement of Cenozoic erupted 
centers that in places overlap the Batholith and along which the coastal area appears to have been 
northerly displaced. 
 
The Aysén region has long been known to contain precious and base metal mineral deposits. 
Lead-zinc-copper minerals have been mined from veins and from irregular pods and stratiform 
bodies hosted in Mesozoic volcanics and sediments and in Paleozoic metamorphics. 
Molybdenite-quartz veinlets occur in pegmatitic facies of the Patagonian Batholith that also 
include scheelite and complex minerals of uranium and thorium. Precious metals related locally 
to lead and zinc minerals have also been explored and mined in vein occurrences in the Chilean-
Argentinean Patagonia. Cerro Bayo in Chile and Cerro Vanguardia, Manantial Espejo, and San 
Jose in Argentina are the largest deposits presently known.  Regional geology is shown in Figure 
2 and Figure 3.

District & Local Geology 
 
The district geology was recently revised by Coeur with emphasis in the volcanic stratigraphy, 
intrusive rocks and structural geology, and their relationship with the different mineralization 
events.  A simplified geologic map of the district is shown in Figure 4. 
 

Figure 4. District & Local Geology 

 

Stratigraphy 
 
The rocks exposed in the Cerro Bayo District are part of a thick pile of silicic volcanics assigned 
to the Ibañez Formation and are believed to represent a more or less continuous series of Jurassic 
to Cretaceous volcanism. The Paleozoic basement that regionally underlies the Mesozoic 
volcanics is not exposed in the district at least to a depth of 370 meters from the surface, 
although fragments of the metamorphic rocks are contained in the overlying volcanics.  The 
sequence is overlain by Tertiary basalts and minor volcaniclastics.  
 
The volcanic sequence that hosts the precious metal mineralization is interpreted to be related to 
a system of large volcanic centers and rhyolitic domes, the most defining of which is the Cerro 
Bayo-Mallines dome complex hosted in a regional north-south trending fracture zone.  The 
volcanic sequence consists of alternating units of pyroclastics rocks of rhyolitic to dacitic 
composition that include basal surge deposits, interbedded with ash fall tuffs, lavas, and 
sediments. The older units are exposed at Laguna Verde while the youngest are exposed at 
Brillantes. The thickness of individual flows varies from tens to over a hundred meters; block 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 23 of 131 

faulting precludes an estimate of the total thickness of the sequence. Several volcanic cooling 
units displaying varying degrees of welding are recognized in the area. Radiometric dating 
ranging from 130 My to 159 My, has been carried out south from the Cerro Bayo District in 
volcanics and intrusives from the Ibañez Formation using K/Ar and Ar/Ar methods.  Results 
indicate a Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous age for these rocks. 
 
Extensive basaltic flows (Meseta Lago Buenos Aires Formation) top the sequence to the south of 
the district representing the western most outcrops of a large basaltic province. A 300 meter thick 
sequence of olivine tholeites to alkaline basalts is exposed consisting of 5 m-25 m thick flows 
occasionally separated by interflow detrital or tuffaceous horizons. Radiometric dating indicates 
two main cycles of effusion dated Eocene and Miocene-Pliocene respectively. 

Intrusive Rocks 
 
Intrusive rocks are sparsely exposed at Cerro Bayo. They are restricted to Mesozoic and Tertiary 
subvolcanic domes, plugs, and dyke swarms of varying compositions. Mesozoic intrusives are 
generally sub-circular flow-banded rhyolitic and dacitic domes characterized by columnar 
jointing and sharp walls that rise 100-250 meters above the surface.  The most prominent of 
these is the Cerro Bayo Dome (Figure 5). Their emplacement is controlled by deep regional 
north-south fractures and/or intersections of major faults. The domes and a set of dacitic flow-
banded dikes are estimated to be cogenetic with the felsic volcanics, pre and post dating the main 
mineralization events. Andesitic dike swarms controlled by ENE fractures are common all over 
the district post dating mineralization. Tertiary necks and plugs of massive basalts and dioritic-
gabbro porphyries are exposed in the highlands of the district, generating local argillization of 
the host rocks. These bodies are clearly cogenetic with the basaltic volcanism.

Structural Geology 
 
Four main district-scale structural orientations have been identified in the Cerro Bayo and 
Laguna Verde areas. These include N-S, NE-SW to ENE-WSW, and NW-SE.  A Landsat 
lineament study centered about the district area shows that district-scale structures form parts of 
regional-scale structures with the same orientations. These trends correspond to arc-parallel (N-
S), arc normal (E-W) and conjugate transfer structures (NE-SW and NW-SE).    

Arc Parallel Structures 
 
Arc parallel structures are part of a north-south oriented, deep-seated regional fault system that 
controls the emplacement of the Cerro Bayo and other domes in the area as well as some veins at 
Mallines, Meseta, and Brillantes areas. At Laguna Verde a NS to NNE arcuate fault system 
assumed to be related to the arc-parallel structures contains brecciated veins and breccias with 
silver-gold-molybdenum-lead-zinc mineralization.   The entire district, particularly the Cerro 
Bayo area, is contained within this arc-parallel structural corridors.  

Arc-Normal Structures 
 
Arc-Normal structures are orientated EW and are the least frequent in number. They form faults 
with very large displacements in the district.  They control the southern boundary of the 
Brillantes zone and the boundary between the southern Cerro Bayo area and the Raul Block. 
Indications of dip-slip movements in excess of 400 meters are suggested based on volcanic unit 
displacement. 

Conjugate Transfer Structures 
 
Two main set of structures are grouped within the conjugate transfer structures. The most 
important is the NW-SE fracture system that controls the majority of the main stage precious 
metal epithermal veins such as Lucero and Javiera at Cerro Bayo, the Guanaco vein system at the 
Guanaco Block, and Temer, Condor and Tranque veins at Laguna Verde.  A second structural 
system is a late stage, post-mineralization, right lateral ENE fault system responsible for the 
block faulting that formed the present day topography. On a District scale the combined effects 
of the arc-normal and NE-SW transfer structures is to generally down drop stratigraphy to the 
north. 
 
Pre- and post-mineral activity is documented in all of the described structural system.

SECTION 8 – DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The Cerro Bayo District hosts at least 50 major veins and stockworks with gold and silver 
mineralization located in six mineralized zones; 1) Cerro Bayo-Guanaco-Cascada, 2) Laguna 
Verde, 3) Mallines, 4) Horquetas, 5) Meseta, and 6) Brillantes. Initially mining was focused on 
the Laguna Verde zone (formerly called the Fachinal area). Since May 2002 mining has been 
carried out preferentially to the east in the Cerro Bayo area.  Late in 2006 CMCB started 
exploratory underground drifting at the Cascada vein system to the south of Cerro Bayo. 

Cerro Bayo – Guanaco - Cascada 
 
At the Cerro Bayo, Guanaco, and Cascada zones gold and silver mineralization occur in veins, 
vein systems and veinlets hosted in a moderately welded sequence of dacitic tuffs of the Jara and 
Fica volcanic units. The volcanic sequence is intruded by the Cerro Bayo and other dacite domes 
considered to be a post mineral event. 
 
The main vein systems have a N15-35ºW orientation, vary in dip from vertical to 75º NW and 
SE. Strike lengths between 50 and 1,200 meters have been recognized in the veins evaluated to 
date. Additional extensions in excess of 1,000 meters disrupted by ENE-WSW major faults or 
covered by unconsolidated gravel deposits have been identified.  Widths are highly variable 
between the different vein systems and in individual veins along strike and down dip, varying 
from centimeters up to 5 meters. 
 
Mineralization is typically epithermal, of the low sulfidation type, and representative of the main 
mineralization stage of the district. There is no evidence at the Cerro Bayo, Guanaco, or Cascada 
areas of the mesothermal and porphyry type mineralization events recognized in other sectors of 
the district. Veins are normally brecciated and locally contain banded textures. They consist 
mainly of fine grained quartz and chalcedonic silica, adularia, and fluorite, with minor amounts 
of barite and carbonates. The sulfide content is low, less than 5%, consisting mainly of pyrite, 
and silver sulphosalts as disseminations and bands.  Moderate argillic alteration is widespread in 
the area. Strong silicification and silico-argillic alteration occurs as haloes along the veins.     

Laguna Verde 
 
Gold and silver mineralization occur in veins, hydrothermal and tectonic breccias, stockworks 
(sheeted veins) and veinlets hosted in a moderately to strongly welded sequence of rhyolitic and 
dacitic tuffs of the Temer, Jara and Fica volcanic units. Flow banded dacitic domes intrude the 
volcanic sequence at the Coigues Hill, and as at Cerro Bayo, field evidence suggests a post 
mineral event.    
 
Two main vein systems are recognized at Laguna Verde. NS to NNE trending brecciated veins 
and breccias varying  in dip from vertical to 45º E, and N15ºW to N35ºW oriented veins varying 
in dip between vertical and 75º NW and SE. Strike lengths up to 800 meters have been 
recognized in some of the vein systems evaluated to date. Widths are highly variable between the 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 26 of 131 

different vein systems and in individual veins along strike and down dip varying from 
centimeters up to 50 meters in breccias and stockworks (sheeted zones). 
Two different mineralization events can be recognized at Laguna Verde. A mesothermal early 
stage Ag-Mo-Zn-Pb with subordinated gold, well exposed in the Taitao and Breccia zones; and, 
a late stage typical epithermal gold-silver rich system, of the low sulfidation type, representative 
of the main mineralization stage of the district, represented by the Condores, Temer and Tranque 
vein systems.  
 
Brecciated veins and tectonic breccias are the typical structures of the early stage mineralization 
while the late stage epithermal mineralization is represented by banded veins, locally brecciated.  
They consist mainly of fine grained quartz and chalcedonic silica, adularia, and fluorite, with 
minor amounts of barite and carbonates. The general sulfide content is low, less than 5%, being 
higher in the early stage event. Sulfides are mainly pyrite, silver sulphosalts and locally 
sphalerite as disseminations, clusters, and bands. 

Other Areas 
 
Preliminary exploration has been carried out in the district outside of the Laguna Verde, Cerro 
Bayo, Guanaco, and Cascada areas. Epithermal veins and porphyry style alteration and 
mineralization are known to exist in the Mallines, Horquetas, Rodados Colorados, Meseta and 
Brillantes areas where surface mapping and sampling, as well as restricted drilling, indicate 
interesting mineral potential.  
 
Of these areas the best known are Mallines and Meseta. Large vein systems and stockwork zones 
(sheeted zones) are exposed at Mallines on the surface, with textural and chemical characteristics 
that suggest their present day exposure level is above the favorable horizon in the epithermal 
system, though local indications of high grade mineralization have been found.  
 
At Meseta, east from Mallines, vein systems and stockwork zones are evidenced on the surface, 
with chemical and textural characteristics that suggest that the present day exposures are high in 
the hydrothermal system.  In addition, large silica replacement horizons are exposed in that area.  
They are interpreted to represent silica flooding at the paleo-water table, clearly above the metal 
deposition level in low sulphidation systems. The latter suggests that mineralized zones may be 
present at depth.

SECTION 9 – MINERALIZATION 
 
Gold and silver mineralization is contained in veins, stockworks (sheeted zones), and breccias.  
The deposits being exploited today show multiple stages of mineralization and display open-
space filling and banding, typical of low-sulfidation style epithermal mineralization. Mineralogy 
is complex and is associated with alteration assemblages that suggest at least three types or 
stages of precious metals deposition environments. A clearly epithermal gold-silver 
mineralization event hosted mainly in NNW and N-S to NNE structural trends with local 
Bonanza grade characteristics such as the Cerro Bayo and Cascada veins occurred. This event 
was predated by a more likely mesothermal environment with silver-gold and base metals (Mo, 
Zn, and Pb) mineralization hosted in arcuate N-S to NNE veins and tectonic breccias.  This style 
of mineralization is only known to exist in the Laguna Verde zone and interpreted as a result of 
igneous intrusions, doming, and subsequent collapse. A late mineralizing event is interpreted to 
correspond to the emplacement of a porphyritic stock and related apophyses at Rodados 
Colorados which is characterized by a porphyry style alteration pattern. This includes moderately 
extensive propylitic alteration with chlorite, epidote, disseminated cubic pyrite and specular 
hematite and molybdenum mineralization. Structures have a gangue dominated by calcite with 
locally abundant oxides and relict pyrite. Mineralization is characterized by gold-silver 
associated with copper-lead-zinc. This type of mineral assemblage as well as the porphyry style 
alteration occurs at Horquetas in the western portion of the district, which is interpreted to belong 
to the same late stage mineralization event. 
 
Over 50 major veins have been identified to date within the property. Vein mineralogy consists 
of predominantly quartz with a minor but complex sulfide suite and accessory gangue minerals.  
The veins pinch and swell following pre-mineral faults and fractures. Exposed strike lengths vary 
from 300 to 2,200 m and widths vary from 0.5 to 5.0 m, with local pods up to 6 to 7 m wide. 
 
The control of mineralization is considered to be mostly structural. The mineral fluids were 
channeled along pre-mineral faults or fracture zones that were in-filled during successive 
hydrothermal pulses. 
 
Lithology plays a role in mineral control. Brittleness and plasticity of the host units play a role in 
controlling the width of the veins, the degree of development of sheeted zones, as well as the 
variation in the dip of the veins due to refraction. Mineral shoots show a large horizontal 
extension up to 800 m and a more restricted vertical extension, generally less than 200 m, 
indicating a possible lithological control of metal deposition or deposition in a boiling zone of 
restricted vertical extent as normal in epithermal systems.   

Mineralogy 
 
The mineralogy and textures of the main stage event and the associated alteration phases are 
consistent with a low-sulfur model for volcanic-hosted precious metal deposits. 
 
Gold and silver occur as complex suites of minerals.  Gold is mostly found as inclusions in 
pyrite, filling cavities and irregular surfaces in strongly fractured porous grains. It has also been 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 28 of 131 

detected as inclusions along cleavage in galena and iron-deficient sphalerite. Free gold, partly 
supergene, is found in quartz-bound grains, and as irregular crusts and flakes in micro cracks 
cutting the gangue, and within partially oxidized sulphides. Analyses with a Scanning Electron 
Microscope indicate that gold is argentian (electrum) with a silver content that may reach 40%. 
 
Silver is contained in a variety of minerals. Sulphosalts are the most common, including 
freibergite, stephanite, proustite, pyrargyrite and polybasite. Stromeyerite is also common, as 
well as native silver. Argentite/acanthite, chlorargyrite and boleite are supergene products of 
surficial oxidation. In veins and veinlets the sulphides form irregular bands and patchy 
aggregates and are finely disseminated in the matrix of hydrothermal and tectonic breccias. They 
are commonly included along fractures in pyrite grains and are also found in the margins of 
galena aggregates. Larger sulfide grains may include sphalerite and electrum. Silver minerals 
appear to be more widespread than gold in the district. 
 
Base metal sulfides are common though not abundant in the district. These include mostly 
sphalerite, galena, and chalcopyrite; forming irregular aggregates, stringers, and in some cases, 
massive veinlets. Tetrahedrite occurs occasionally, as well as bornite and famatinite. Supergene 
base metal products are rare in the area, with the exception of local covellite, chalcocite 
(digenite, idaite), cerussite, smithsonite and hydrohetearilite.     
 
Molybdenum mineralization is common in veins and tectonic breccias in the Laguna Verde zone 
and consists of specs and fine disseminations of molybdenite accompanied by tungsten and zinc 
rich wulfenite and jordisite. Oxidation has produced ferrimolybdenite and ilsemanite close to the 
surface. 
 
Quartz is the main gangue and occurs in a variety of grain sizes and textures. Several stages of 
deposition are evidenced, alternating with periods of brecciation and cementation. Pyrite is 
ubiquitous, as disseminations, aggregates, and veinlets. Adularia is common, intergrown with 
quartz and in veinlets. Carbonates, mostly in veinlets, are common, including mainly calcite and 
some rhodocrocite, ankerite and siderite. Fluorite and barite are late gangue minerals. Clays are 
generally present, forming aggregates of kaolinite-illite, smectite, and very minor 
sericite/pyrophyllite; sericite is uncommon, except where host-rock fragments are included in the 
mineral bodies. Hematite is locally found and partly limonitized.      

Alteration 
 
Hydrothermal alteration is subtle. Glacial erosion removed the acid leach and steam heated zones 
of the system preserving at the present surface a level that was under the water table at the time 
of mineralization. Bleaching is scarce, except of narrow zones along major faults and in the 
immediate margins of major veins where strong argilized haloes 2m to 12m wide can be 
observed. 
 
The most pervasive alteration is silicification, which appears to have affected the host rocks over 
the life of the hydrothermal system. Medium grained milky quartz was deposited in early stages 
and microcrystalline to opaline quartz in late stages. Adularia is found with quartz in veinlets 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 29 of 131 

adjacent to the veins. Very fine sericite, illite, smectite and calcite replace feldspar and biotite. 
Kaolinite has been formed by oxidation. 
 
Pyritization is widespread in the district, mostly as an early stage of alteration with medium 
grained quartz. Propyllitic alteration forms haloes that surround bleached zones, marked by 
chlorite, epidote, carbonate, saussuritization of feldspar and montmorillonitic clays. Deuteric 
alteration was common in tuffs outside the main mineralized areas forming aggregates of 
plagioclase, epidote, sericite, and zeolites.  
 
The age of alteration related to the mineralization is unclear.  The only available determination 
(K-Ar) comes from sericite collected close to a major vein which gave an age of 114 +- 3 Ma 
(Early Cretaceous), coincident with the most intensive period of intrusive magmatism in the 
region. An intensive sampling program for radiometric dating of the mineralization and 
alteration was recently carried out in cooperation with the Chilean Geological Survey 
(Sernageomin).  

Geochemistry  
 
Trace elements geochemistry has been focused to date in the most obvious components of 
mineralization apart from precious metals, base metals, and molybdenum.  Available data 
suggests that for the two first stages of mineral deposition the signature of mineralization in the 
district is best defined by gold and silver in the main stage of mineralization and also by high 
concentrations of zinc and molybdenum in the previous silver rich and base metal stage. Not 
enough information is available for the latest porphyry type mineral assemblage.  
 
The clearest enrichment in trace elements is evidenced in hydrothermal and tectonic breccias, 
which are enriched in lead, zinc and molybdenum. Silver values tend to be more consistent and 
relate to other trace elements in these bodies, though crosscutting quartz veinlets carrying gold 
complicate the analysis. The best correlations are between base metals, silver and molybdenum, 
and silver and zinc. Gold correlates poorly with other elements.  It appears that the best signature 
for the different mineralizing events is the association Ag-Mo-Zn (with subsidiary gold) for the 
initial stage and the association Au-Ag-Cu-Pb for the late stage. 
 
Stockworks (sheeted zones) are enriched in gold, molybdenum and zinc, particularly where close 
to major brecciated structures. A lesser enrichment in silver and lead is also evident. Silver 
values are again more related to other trace elements than gold. Best correlations are found in 
these zones between base metals and between silver, molybdenum, lead and zinc. Gold correlates 
poorly with other elements, except for a subtle relationship with copper. The different 
mineralizing events are marked here by the association Ag-Mo-Pb-Zn (with subsidiary gold) for 
the initial stage, and by Au-Cu for the late stage.  
 
Veins are enriched in gold, silver, and zinc and to a lesser degree in lead. Molybdenum is erratic 
with values over 100 ppm only in restricted brecciated structures. The relationship between 
precious and trace metals is not so clear as in the other mineralized bodies.  Base metals are 
clearly correlated. Silver correlates weakly with lead and zinc, and gold with copper. 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 30 of 131 

Molybdenum is unrelated both to precious and base metals. Mineralizing events are not well 
defined by elementary associations. 
 
Limited studies have been performed using other pathfinders. Gold appears to be related to 
mercury and subordinately to antimony.  Silver is well marked by enrichments in mercury, 
antimony, and arsenic; reflecting the well known mineralogy and the possible presence of 
mercurial tetrahedrite undetected to date in polished sections. Selenium has been locally found to 
be enriched in some veins. Barium has been noticed to be enriched in rocks and soils from 
altered terrains in the highlands, thought to represent hot-spring environments. Thallium has 
proven to be negatively correlated with both precious and base metals. Tungsten, tellurium, and 
bismuth have seldom been detected.

SECTION 10 – EXPLORATION 
 
The exploration targets at Cerro Bayo include veins, veinlet systems, stockworks (sheeted 
zones), and hydrothermal and tectonic breccias hosted in moderately welded Mesozoic rhyolites 
and dacites.  The main veins, veinlets and stockwork systems trend N15-35°W, vary in dip from 
vertical to 75° NW and SE, and are exposed for strike lengths of 50 to 1,200 meters; widths are 
highly variable along strike and down dip, varying from a few centimeters up to 5 meters.  
Breccias and brecciated veins trend NS to NNE, vary in dip from vertical to 45° E, and are 
exposed for up to 400 m in strike length; widths are highly variable along strike and down dip, 
varying from a few centimeters to 50 meters. 
 
Mineral exploration activities have been carried out in the district since early 1984.  Activities 
were originally conducted by permanent staff of FCEC and since 1990 by the geological staff of 
Coeur's wholly-owned subsidiary, CDE Chilean Mining Corporation.  They have included as a 
first pass structural and alteration interpretation using satellite imagery, reconnaissance mapping 
at 1:5,000-1:25,000 scales and chip sampling of most promising outcrops.  A regional program 
of age dating is in progress in cooperation with the Chilean Geological Survey (Sernageomin).  
Selected targets have been the subject of detailed geological mapping at 1:500-1:1,000 scales, 
systematic channel sampling of outcrops every 5-25 meters, deep trenching of stockwork zones, 
thin and polished section studies, partial ICP studies of trace elements, and geophysical surveys 
(airborne magnetics and radiometrics and ground IP / resistivity, magnetics and CSAMT). 
 
Core drilling has been the main means of evaluating resources.  Restricted air reverse drilling has 
been locally used attempting to define bulk tonnage targets.  Exploratory tunnels were driven in 
the past into the most promising underground vein targets.  Resources have been defined from 
geological models prepared on the basis of adequately spaced cross sections and plan views. 2D 
and 3D block models prepared using geostatistical parameters have been used since the early 
1990s, to produce resource estimates categorized according to ranges of influence of individual 
samples or composites.  
 
The area hosts numerous exploration targets with gold and silver mineralization, distributed in 
two main mineralized zones: Cerro Bayo-Guanaco and Laguna Verde.  Less known 
mineralization, which has been the subject of preliminary work, is found in other areas: Meseta, 
Horquetas and Brillantes.  Mining was initially concentrated in Laguna Verde, where several 
deposits were mined (Taitao 1, Temer 1-3, Condor 1-3, Tranque, Juncos, Breccia, NE 
Stockwork, etc.) by open pit and underground methods.  Since early 2002 the focus of mining 
has concentrated on several vein deposits at Cerro Bayo (Lucero, Luz Eliana, Javiera, Celia, 
etc.). 
 
The main features of the different areas may be summarized as follows. 

Cerro Bayo-Guanaco-Cascada      
 
This zone hosts several veins and veinlet systems hosted preferentially in moderately welded 
dacitic tuffs and subsidiarily in volcanic sediments and welded rhyolitic tuffs.  The mineralized 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 32 of 131 

structures are preferentially oriented N15-35°W, have in general sub vertical or very steep dips, 
and are exposed for 50 to 1,200 meters along strike.  Extensions up to 1,000 meters long have 
been identified under cover.   Widths vary from a few centimeters up to 5 meters.  Mineralization 
in all the structures known to date is clearly epithermal with low sulfide content. 

Laguna Verde   
 
Precious metals mineralization occurs in this area in veins, veinlet systems, stockworks (sheeted 
zones) and breccias (hydrothermal and tectonic), hosted preferentially in moderately welded 
rhyolitic tuffs and subordinately in dacitic tuffs.  Two main mineralized trends are distinguished 
at Laguna Verde:  NS to NNE brecciated veins and breccias and N15-35°W veins and veinlet 
systems.  The breccias vary in dip from vertical to 45°E, and the veins are normally sub vertical 
to steeply dipping tabular features.  Strike lengths up to 800 meters are exposed in the area.  
Widths vary from few centimeters up to 50 meters in breccias and stockworks (sheeted zones).  
Mineralization at Laguna Verde is representative of two different events: a mesothermal early 
event with precious and base metals, and enriched in molybdenum, represented by several 
brecciated veins and breccias, and a late precious metals low sulfidation epithermal event 
represented by discrete veins and veinlets. 

Mallines  
 
Veins, veinlet systems, stockworks (sheeted zones) and brecciated veins have been preliminarily 
explored at Mallines, south of the main Cerro Bayo area.  The mineralized structures are hosted 
in rhyolitic welded tuffs, intruded by a series of post mineral dacitic domes.  The largest system 
(Veta Madre) is formed by a dense series of veins, veinlet systems and stockworks trending NS, 
crossed by a N30W oriented set of narrow veins and veinlets, forming a densely mineralized area 
exposed for about 400 m along strike and 200 meters across.  Other veins and veinlet systems 
(Segunda, Brechosa) oriented NE and NW appear to converge to the main trend.  The textural 
and chemical characteristics of the mineralized structures suggest that the surface exposures are 
above the favorable depositional horizon of precious metals epithermal systems. 

Meseta, Horquetas, Brillantes 
     
Epithermal veins, veinlets and stockworks, and porphyry style alteration features have been 
found during reconnaissance work in these areas, where geological mapping, preliminary 
sampling of outcrops and restricted drilling suggest an interesting mineral potential.  The most 
interesting of these to date is Meseta, where veins, veinlet systems and stockworks have been 
found in three blocks, spatially associated to very large silica replacements of fine grained tuffs, 
interpreted to reflect silica deposition at the paleo-water table above the horizon where precious 
metals may have been deposited in a low sulfidation epithermal environment.  
 
Since the start of drilling in the district back in 1985, all core and drill chips have been logged in 
detail using standard industry practices.  Geotechnical information has also been collected from 
the core since the inception of the exploration program.  All mineralized intervals have been 
sampled and assayed using geological criteria.  Quality control procedures have included routine 
check assays of sample pulps, and check assays of duplicate pulps prepared from coarse rejects 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 33 of 131 

and use of blanks to asses the quality of the sample preparation procedures.  Original assays and 
duplicates have been statistically analyzed by estimating relative variances and errors.  No 
sample preparation or assay problems have been noticed. 
 
The substantial and permanent exploration activities carried out from 1985 until 1989 by 
Freeport Chilean Exploration Company and since 1990 by CDE Chilean Mining Corporation 
have resulted in a large database of surface and drilling samples.  The database was originally 
maintained in manual form; since the early 1990s a computerized system was implemented in 
Excel; and lately a centralized database in Access was made available.  The data base has been 
utilized, verified and updated by Coeur's staff repeatedly during all these years.  The author finds 
no reason to suspect the reliability and veracity of the results attained during the exploration 
programs carried out to date in the district.  Our confidence on the reliability of the geological 
interpretations arises from the fact that when mineral deposits have been opened from 
underground or surface, the mineralized structures found have coincided very closely in their 
location and geometry with the interpreted features, and their grades have been within 
expectations resulting from our estimates.  

2007 Results 
 
During 2007, a total of 154 holes were drilled for a total of 28,000 meters for the purpose of 
defining additional resources. From this work, an additional 76,200 oz of gold and 10,832,200 oz 
of silver were added to the resources. 
 
During 2007, a total of 255 drill holes were drilled for a total of 32,573 meters for the purpose of 
defining additional reserves. From this work, an additional 53,100 oz of gold and 3,908,800 oz of 
silver were added to the reserves. 

Current Exploration 
 
Coeur's current exploration and development programs aim to discover new resources and 
develop resources into reserves across the district.   Exploration is underway to identify new gold 
and silver deposits and test several targets that have had only preliminary testing in the past or 
are as yet untested, with an ultimate goal of defining new mineral resources to at least an Inferred 
level of confidence.  This program basically includes detailed geological mapping and surface 
channel sampling followed by drilling.  Satellite imagery, geophysics and geochemical surveys 
are used as complements to define drilling targets.   
 
The Cerro Bayo discovery program will total approximately 24,000 meters of core drilling in 
2008 and will be carried out from surface with two Company core drills supplemented by one 
core contracted rig whenever necessary.  The exploration program will be carried out by Coeur 
South America's Chilean Exploration department.  The exploration budget proposed totals 
US$2.4 million.  
 
A reserve development drilling program with a budget of US$1.03 million was proposed for 
2008.  A total close to 24,000 meters of core drilling is planned to be carried out with that 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 34 of 131 

budget. The development program is under the supervision of the Cerro Bayo Mine Geology 
Department.  Development drilling is planned with a two fold target: 

• To define reserves in several vein systems in Cerro Bayo, Laguna Verde, and Cascada 
where resources have been defined; and  

• To increase the reserve base along extensions of known deposits in Cerro Bayo, Laguna 
Verde (includes Coigües Este), and Cascada.

Drilling procedures are discussed in more detail in Section 12.  
 
A summary of relevant drill intercepts and horizontal widths are discussed more in Section 12.  
 
Channel sampling is carried out in all cases by CMCB personnel assigned to the Geology 
Department of the mine. 
 
Horizontal widths vary for most of the drilling, due to different vein widths in different systems 
and mineralized stockworks. The main veins in the district are sub-vertical, therefore it is 
necessary to project all data into vertical sections. For this reason, it is necessary to calculate 
horizontal width in data sourced from inclined drillholes. From channel samples, this data is 
measured directly.  Horizontal widths are calculated in the following manner: 
 
 
 

Horizontal width = l * (Sin α *Cos β *Sin γ + Sin β * Cos α)

where:

α : vein dip (real) in intercept point 
β : drillhole dip

Resources and reserves in the Cerro Bayo District have been estimated in four main areas: Cerro 
Bayo-Guanaco which includes the former Cerro Bayo, Guanaco, and Raul veins, and the recently 
discovered Marcela Sur vein; Meseta which includes the Cascada vein; and Laguna Verde which 
includes Taitao-OO-NE Stockwork zone, Tranque, Condor, Temer veins and Gabriela veins.  
The geologic interpretation discussed in Section 8 has been based on a large part on the 
following drilling.

Cerro Bayo-Guanaco 
1,962 core holes totaling 205,473 meters;

SECTION 12 – SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
As stated in Table 7, there has been over 484,000 meters of drilling and channel sampling 
completed at Cerro Bayo in 3,551 core holes, 666 RC holes, and 25,200 channels. 
 
Three sizes of core drilling have been drilled in the Cerro Bayo District: 
BQ (36 mm) drilled from surface and underground; 
NQ (47 mm) drilled from surface; and 
HQ (64mm) drilled from surface. 
The majority of the holes used in the evaluation of the current resources and reserves are BQ in 
size.  Drilling has been carried out by contractors and by CDE Chilean Exploration personnel 
using CMCB owned rigs (Diamec 252 and Diamec 262).     
 
Sampling of core drilling is performed under strictly geological criteria. Geologic and 
geotechnical logging are performed on the core.  The former is carried out by geologists for 
lithological, structural and mineralogical information, while the latter is done by trained 
personnel for recovery and RQD information. Core recoveries are consistently high, averaging 
over 90%. Mineralized intervals are selected for assaying for gold and silver content.  In cases 
where the holes are aimed for a specific target, sampling is carried out only in selected intervals 
of geological interest (veins, veinlets or stockworks), as well as in the adjacent footwall and 
hanging-wall host rock. Sampling interval size varies from a minimum of 0.15 meter to a 
maximum of 2.0 meters. The mean length is 0.50 meters. Due to the small core size (BQ), the 
entire core is consumed in the assaying process. Digital photographs are taken of the core to keep 
a permanent record.  Intervals that are not assayed are in storage at the mine site.  Each sample is 
assayed in-house at the CMCB laboratory on site. Coarse rejects and pulps are retained for future 
test work or further mineralogical and metallurgical woks. According to an external audit carried 
out in November 2001, all procedures used during the drilling program in progress at that time 
were in accordance with North American industry standards.  
 
RC drilling was carried out at the Laguna Verde area in the very early stage of exploration in the 
district; between 1990 and 1992, and was recently reassumed at Laguna Verde starting in 
November 2003.  Recent RC drilling was drilled using contracted services using 5.5 inch bit. 
Sampling was performed on 1.0 meter increments with a targeted total sample size of 40-45kg.  
The drill hole cuttings are logged by the geologists for lithological, structural, and mineralogical 
information.  Boxes with cuttings of the sampled intervals are stored. The reject material for any 
area is bagged and stored until the drilling campaign, interpretation and modeling are complete 
for that area, in order to review or resample if needed.    
 
Horizontal widths vary for much of the drilling due to mineralized stockworks and haloes 
associated with the veins as well as zones of splits and intersections of veins.  Horizontal widths 
for every intercept are known, being calculated on the basis of a formula that relates vein strike 
and dip with hole azimuth and inclination.  
 

Hz  = l * (Sin α *Cos β *Sin γ + Sin β * Cos α) 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 39 of 131 

Horizontal widths are utilized in 2-D models.Table 9 shows the most recent drill hole intercepts 
and horizontal widths (updated through 2007). 
 
There are no known factors that could have contributed to a possible bias of the samples or 
adversely affect accuracy and reliability of the results or the mineral resources and mineral 
reserves reported in this technical report.

Drill Hole Twinning 
 
A total of 10 core holes have been twinned by a second core hole to date in the Cerro Bayo area. 
Twinning includes two holes in the Celia vein; five holes in the Lucero vein; two holes in Luz 
Eliana; and one hole in Andrea Norte. Holes were selected to be representative of the different 
domains and grades in each of the veins. A total of 728.5 meters were drilled for this purpose 
with BQ (3 holes) and NQ (7 holes) core sizes. Core was split in half and assayed at ALS- 
Geolab laboratory in Santiago. Six blanks and seven standards were included for laboratory 
check.   
 
All of the duplicate holes intercepted the vein at, or close to the expected location with the 
exception of BJH-59D which intercepted a dyke and was repeated 5 m south from the original 
hole location. 
 
Comparative results are shown in Table 10.  Some of the holes intercepted more than one vein 
and were included in the analysis.  Results are somewhat variable, either in width or grades, 
which in part may be due to the fact that the entire core was assayed in the original holes while 
only half of it was analyzed in the twin holes. 
 
From the second half of 2007, Coeur South America  implemented in its exploration programs in 
South America, a twin hole drilling program that in all new veins will duplicate 5% of the holes 
with economic mineralization.

Twin Hole VARIANCESOriginal Hole

 
 
Significant differences were seen in many twin holes, but the ranges of magnitude of the high 
grade intercepts were generally confirmed. Main differences in many intercepts are associated to 
very high anomalous silver values.  The variability may be partly accounted for by slight 
deviations in the bearing of the holes, but it would be mostly related to the short extension along 
strike of the very high silver pods sporadically detected in those veins.   
 
Nevertheless it is important to consider the high variability in width and grades, especially in 
high grade intercepts (Luz Eliana and Andrea Norte).  This has proved to be consistent with 
experience in development and mining. 
 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008

High discrepancy is noted in hole BJH-59 drilled in Celia. In this case the original hole 
intercepted the vein north of a blind dike that separates two different mineralogical domains at 
Cerro Bayo Central.  This dike limits to the south the northern Celia vein mineral shoot. The 
duplicate hole first intercepted the dike, so an additional twin was displaced 5 m south from the 
original location and intercepted the Celia vein as expected.  This indicates that hard boundaries 
should be used in the estimation models. A conscientious analysis is also required to define an 
adequate capping of the high grades.  The effect capping grades has on the overall variance 
between the original and duplicate holes is shown in Table 11.

Original (w/ Capping) Twin (w/ capping) VARIANCES

 
 
In addition to the drilling data, nearly 15,000 channels with a total of over 47,000 meters are 
included in the data base.  Channel sampling is done with a jack hammer in both open pits and 
underground.  Samples are taken perpendicular to the mineralized structure at intervals of 3 
meters in underground operations and every 5 meters in open pits.  For underground mining the 
samples are taken from the back, and the sampling is repeated every 4-5 m of vertical advance 
(approximately two cuts or lifts).  The minimum sample length is 0.30 m and the maximum 
length is 1.00 m.  The width of the channel ranges from 0.20 to 0.40 m and the depth is typically 
0.20 m.   The overall length, number of individual samples and weight of the channel sample(s) 
is determined by the width of the mineralized structure and associated "stockwork".  After the 
samples have been collected they are sent to the assay lab for gold and silver analysis.  
 
Coordinates for drill hole collars are surveyed with industry standard survey techniques using 
both in-house and contract surveyors.  Results are reproducible to within a few centimeters.  
Coordinates are checked and verified prior to use in modeling work.   
 
Tropari down-hole surveys were determined to be of un-acceptable quality very early and have 
not been utilized.  Sperry-sun down hole surveys have been taken on the majority of the core 
holes.  No down hole surveys have been done on any reverse circulation drilling.   Results from 
Sperry-sun surveys show slightly less than 4º horizontal and 1.5º vertical deviations per 100 
meters.  This is based on 481 surveyed core holes totaling 45,719 meters of drilling. A multi-shot 
down-hole survey instrument was purchased in 2004 and has been utilized since for down-hole 
surveying every 3 meters along the holes. The surveying information is incorporated in the 3D 
geological modeling, thus minimizing errors in the spatial position of the drill hole intercepts.

There are no known drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that would materially impact the 
accuracy and reliability of the results.

SECTION 13 – SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 
 
There is a complete assay laboratory located at site.  This lab contains all the facilities for sample 
preparation, fire, wet and atomic absorption assays, as well as offices, washrooms, reagents and 
general storage. Both mine and exploration samples are assayed in this facility.  Outside 
consultants have set up the testing procedures in accordance with industry standards. An audit 
was performed by Lakefield Research in 2002 on the laboratory.  Although the lab is not 
certified, their findings were that the laboratory meets international standard operating 
procedures.   
 
Each core sample is identified with a unique sample number that is tracked throughout the 
assaying process.  The as-received samples that range between 0.5 and 5.0 kg are weighed prior 
to crushing.  Following weighing, the sample is jaw crushed to produce a 9.5 mm product, roll 
crushed to achieve 90% passing 2.00 mm (10 mesh ASTM) product, then split with a 1-in. rifle 
to approximately 0.50 kg.  This 0.50 kg sample is dried for 2 hours at 102° C prior to being 
pulverized using a plate pulverizer to 100% passing 0.15 mm (100 mesh ASTM).  After 
pulverizing each sample, the bowl, ring, and puck assembly are disassembled with the pulverized 
sample and placed on a rolling cloth.  The pulverizer assembly is placed back in the bowl with 
another sample.  Two assemblies are used in an alternating fashion.  The pulverized sample is 
rolled and transferred to a numbered envelope.  Silica sand is pulverized at the end of the entire 
sample run in order to minimize possible contamination for the next run.  No cleaning or 
downgrading of the pulverizer assembly is performed during any single sample. No significant 
material is carried over from sample to sample with this equipment.  
 
Each RC sample is identified with a unique sample number that is tracked throughout the 
assaying process. The as-received samples are dried at 105º C if needed.  Following drying, the 
sample is roll crushed to achieve 90% passing 2.00 mm (10 mesh ASTM) product then split with 
a 1 in. rifle to approximately 500 grams.  The sample is further dried for 2 hours at 105º C and 
then pulverized with a ring and puck pulverizer to 100% passing 0.15 mm (100 mesh ASTM).  
After pulverizing each sample, the bowl, ring, and puck assembly are disassembled with the 
pulverized sample and placed on a rolling cloth.  The pulverizer assembly is placed back in the 
bowl with another sample.  Two assemblies are used in an alternating fashion.  The pulverized 
sample is rolled and transferred to a numbered envelope.  Silica sand is pulverized at the end of 
the entire sample run in order to minimize possible contamination for the next run.  No cleaning 
or downgrading of the pulverizer assembly is performed during any single sample. No significant 
material is carried over from sample to sample with this equipment. 
 
Two types of production samples are analyzed: 
 Channel samples and; 
 Stockpile samples. 
 
Each channel sample is identified with a unique sample number that is tracked throughout the 
assaying process. The as-received samples that weigh between 5 and 30 kg are dried at 105º C if 
needed.  Following drying, the sample is jaw crushed to 9.5 mm (3/8"), roll crushed to achieve 
90% passing 2.00 mm (10 mesh ASTM) product, then split with a 1 in. rifle to approximately 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 49 of 131 

500 grams.  The sample is further dried for 2 hours at 105º C and then pulverized with a ring and 
puck pulverizer to 100% passing 0.15 mm (100 mesh ASTM).  After pulverizing each sample, 
the bowl, ring, and puck assembly are disassembled with the pulverized sample and placed on a 
rolling cloth.  The pulverizer assembly is placed back in the bowl with another sample.  Two 
assemblies are used in an alternating fashion.  The pulverized sample is rolled and transferred to 
a numbered envelope.  Silica sand is pulverized at the end of the entire sample run in order to 
minimize possible contamination for the next run.  No cleaning or downgrading of the pulverizer 
assembly is performed during any single sample.  No significant material is carried over from 
sample to sample with this equipment. 
 
Each stockpile sample is identified with a unique sample number that is tracked throughout the 
assaying process. The as-received samples that weigh between 30 and 50 kg are dried at 105º C 
if needed.  Following drying, the sample is jaw crushed to 9.5 mm (3/8") and split with a 1" rifle 
to 20 kg.  This split is then roll crushed to achieve 90% passing 2.00 mm (10 mesh ASTM) 
product, and then split with a 1 in. rifle to approximately 500 grams.  The sample is further dried 
for 2 hours at 105º C and then pulverized with a ring and puck pulverizer to 100% passing 0.15 
mm (100 mesh ASTM).  After pulverizing each sample, the bowl, ring, and puck assembly are 
disassembled with the pulverized sample and placed on a rolling cloth.  The pulverizer assembly 
is placed back in the bowl with another sample.  Two assemblies are used in an alternating 
fashion.  The pulverized sample is rolled and transferred to a numbered envelope.  Silica sand is 
pulverized at the end of the entire sample run in order to minimize possible contamination for the 
next run.  No cleaning or downgrading of the pulverizer assembly is performed during any single 
sample.  No significant material is carried over from sample to sample with this equipment. 
 
Assaying is done by fire assaying methods with a gravimetric finish.  Each sample is fire-assayed 
using a traditional lead oxide flux as well as a known addition of silver, called in inquart. The 
samples are placed in gas fired assay furnaces.  The fusion of the flux and inquarted sample 
produces a molten mixture that is poured into conical molds and cooled.  The lead button formed 
during the fusion process is separated from the cooled slag and pounded to remove any adhering 
slag.  The lead button is then cupelled using a magnesium oxide cupel.  The remaining doré bead 
is flattened and weighed.  The weighed doré is placed in a test tube and concentrated nitric acid 
added.  The button is then rinsed, ammonia added, and rinsed again. The button is dried and then 
roasted for 5 minutes.  After cooling, the gold is weighed.  Gold to silver ratios are checked.  If 
greater than 0.40 additional silver and lead is added and the sample re-analyzed.   
 
The gold and silver present in the sample are expressed according to the following formula: 
Au (g/t) =  Au (mg) / sample weight (g); and 
Ag (g/t) = (Au + Ag) (mg) –  Au (mg) / sample weight (g) 
 
Coarse gold has not been encountered to date at Cerro Bayo.  If it is encountered the following 
form would be utilized to calculate grades. 
 
Au (g/t) =  (       Sample       ) * Au grade + (       Coarse       ) * Coarse Au grade       
(Sample + Coarse)     (Sample +Coarse)

An internal quality control program was developed for the CMCB lab and comprises:  
Duplicate assay pulps on 5% of volume; 
Duplicate assay splits on 5% of volume; and 
Standards inserted every 20th sample.  
 
External checks are also done by sending duplicate assay pulps to an external lab also with 
standards inserted every 20th sample.   
 
Snowden Mining Consultants Inc., Jacobs Engineering, The Winter's Company, Lakefield 
Research and Magri Consultants have reviewed the QA/QC laboratory procedures. They have all 
concluded that the laboratory quality control standards are all within acceptable industry 
standards. 

Duplicate Assaying 
The main QA/QC program is performed in-house at the Cerro Bayo lab and consists of running 
5% of the sample pulps in duplicate.  Duplicate assays should fall within 10 percent of the 
original assay value.  When duplicate assays do not meet these requirements, the duplicate 
sample, as well as the previous and following samples are rerun and checked against the first 
duplicate and the original assay.   Tables 12 and 13 show the statistical analysis results of the 
duplicate pulps, checked during 2007. Figures 6 and 7 show the results of the duplicate pulp 
assaying. See Diagram 1. Schematic QAQC Protocol.

Primary Sampling & Assaying – This is the process of collecting 
the samples at the mine site and the sample preparation and 
assaying undertaken at the primary (mine) laboratory.  The assay 
results will contain cumulative errors resulting from the sampling, 
sample preparation, and assaying.  The QC methods outlined below 
are designed to detect and measure these errors. 

Grind Checks – can be performed after each crushing and 
pulverizing stage to determine if the particle size reduction is 
adequate.  The particle size is critical to achieving a homogeneous 
pulp split. 
 
Performed on 1% of assay volume at site lab. 

Check Assaying by Primary Lab – is a measure of the primary 
labs assay precision and a good indicator of the homogeneity of the 
pulp. 
 
Performed on 5% of assay volume. 
  

Check Assaying at Secondary Lab – gives an indication of assay 
bias between the primary and secondary labs.  The bias is relative 
between labs and does not tell the accuracy of the results. 
  
Performed on 2% of assay volume. 

Check Sampling at Primary Lab – is undertaken to determine 
whether the assay split taken from the original sample is 
representative of that sample.  A second split is taken from the 
original sample using the exact same sampling technique.  The 
second sample is prepared and assayed by the primary lab using 
exactly the same methods used for the original sample.  Any errors 
therefore should be due to sampling protocol. 
  
Performed at 2% of sample volume.

A total of 1789 gold duplicates are available from the 2007.  The statistics show that acceptable 
results are achieved on all grade ranges except for very low grade. When values lower than 0.50 
gpt are removed, the results improve significantly.  The quality of assaying for mineral grade 
material is very good, as evidenced by the improvement in the statistics when values below 2 gpt 
are removed. 
 
A total of 1789 silver duplicates are available from the 2007.  The silver duplicates are very 
replicable at all grades.  A marginal improvement in the statistics is evidenced when lower 
grades are removed from the exercise.  Very good replication of values in samples with high 
grade contents is achieved.  
 
Based on the duplicate assaying results, the laboratory shows good precision levels for both gold 
and silver assaying. 

Duplicate Samples 
 
To determine if primary pulps are representative of the original sample, a duplicate split of the 
original sample was prepared and analyzed.  Duplicate samples should fall within 20 percent of 
the original sample value.  The statistical analysis results for these "re-preps" are shown in Table 
14 and Table 15.  Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the results of the duplicate split assaying.

 Results 
 
Standard Assaying 
 
CMCB utilized four mineral standards and one concentrate standard (STD-01): 
 
CBm-04 - 11.79 gpt Au, 617.56 gpt Ag; 
CBm-05 - 97.54 gpt Au, 4,651 gpt Ag; 
CBm-06 - 1.17 gpt Au, 72.19 gpt Ag 
CBm-07 - 15.58 gpt Au, 623.2 gpt Ag; and  
STD-01 - 333.23 gpt Au, 16,861 gpt Ag. 
 
CMCB composited the standard samples from individual samples collected Cerro Bayo veins. 
The average gold and silver grades for the standard and blank composites were determined by 
taking the average of extensive sample cuts of each composite, as assayed by CMCB. 
 
The statistics for standards show acceptable relative errors in gold and silver for all standards.  
Statistics significantly improve for mineral grades (gold above 1.00 gpt and silver above 100 
gpt).  Statistical analysis results of 2007 standard checks are listed in Table 18.  Graphical results 
are shown in Figures 12 through 21.

External Checks 
 
Selected duplicate sample pulps were sent to an external lab for verification.  The external lab 
utilized during 2007 was: 
 
ALS CHEMEX CHILE 
Los Ebanistas N°8521 
La Reina, Santiago Chile 
Certifications: 
AS / NZS ISO 9001:2000 
 

External Duplicate Pulps 
 
Tables 19 and 20 show the results of statistical analysis of the external duplicate pulps completed 
during the 2007.  Figures 22 and 23 show the results of the external duplicate assaying.

External Standards 
 
Standards were inserted into the external duplicate pulp stream to check the accuracy of the 
external lab.  Table 21 shows the statistical results of the external standard assaying. The 
graphical results are shown in Figure 24 through Figure 29.

The statistics for external standards show an acceptable accuracy for all standards.  The graphical 
results suggest that on an individual sample basis, there may be some concerns with accuracy, or 
potentially sample handling at ALS lab.  The graphics also show there is a high grade bias 
between the CMCB lab and the ALS lab.  Note that the "true" value for the standards is 
determined from extensive analysis of the standard material at the CMCB lab.

External Duplicate Concentrate Assays 
 
Checks of all concentrate composites are verified by an external lab. The external lab utilized 
during 2007 was: 
 
ALEX STEWART INTERCOP CHILE Y CÍA LTDA. 
Avenida Quilín 2910, Macul 
Santiago, Chile 
Certifications: 
ISO 9001:2000 
NCh-ISO 17025.Of2001  
 
To verify the grades of concentrate shipped, Cerro Bayo samples each truck-load of concentrate 
prior to departure from Cerro Bayo.  Alex Stewart takes a separate sample of each truck as it 
arrives at the secure warehouse in Puerto Chacabuco.  The truck samples are composited for each 
week of production.  These "duplicates" are compared to ensure very good control of concentrate 
grades. 
 
Table 22 and Table 23 show the results of the statistical analysis of the external lab.  Graphical 
results are shown in Figure 30 and Figure 31.

QA/QC Summary 
 
Results from the internal duplicate and standard assaying show acceptable precision and 
accuracy internally from the CMCB Lab.  Duplicate samples show that assay pulps are 
representative of the original sample.  
 
Examining the external results, the CMCB lab shows a small bias in high-grade mineral samples 
in comparision to the ALS lab results.  For 2008, these tests will continue in a similar format. 
 
Based on the internal duplicate assaying and standard assaying results, the CMCB lab is 
producing acceptable results. It is the opinion of the Qualified Person that the sampling, sample 
preparation, security, and analytical procedures are all within acceptable industry standards and 
would not materially affect the quality of the mineral resources or mineral reserves estimates.

SECTION 14 – DATA VERIFICATION 
 
A rigorous data validation process has been done on the Cerro Bayo data set.  Several validation 
techniques have been utilized in this process.  The first error checking is completed with the 
Master database which is discussed in more detail below.  Checks are complete for any non-
conforming assay information such as duplicate samples and missing sample ID's.  The database 
also has built in features such as automatically calculating sample lengths that minimize possible 
error generators.  The database also generates very good reports that allow the data to be checked 
visually.  The second round of error checking is done with the Gemcom Mine Planning software.  
Gemcom has very good error checking capabilities and checks for errors in Header, Survey, and 
Assay information.  Some specific items checked by Gemcom include valid headers, valid 
numbers, negative intervals, intervals out of order, intervals without assays, and sample ID's 
without assays.  The third round of checking involves visually checking the data.  A complete 
check of hard copy versus Gemcom data was done.  In addition, each drill hole that is imported 
into Gemcom is visually checked to ensure that all locations and survey information are correct.  
 
The primary step in data validation is managing the data with a process that minimizes potential 
errors in data entry.  All sampling data generated by exploration and operations is input and 
stored in a master Access database.  This includes all: 

Drill holes;  
Channel samples; and 
Grab samples. 

 
Security features on the database include back-end lock-out and history tracking.  Only the 
database manager has the password that allows access to the back-end.  This ensures that no one 
can alter the data, tables, or forms of the database from the back-end.  The other security feature 
with the database is that to enter the database, each user must logon under their name.  The 
database tracks each and every change made to the database and tags who and when the changes 
were made.  This includes any new data entry or any change to previously entered data. This 
record is saved and can be viewed by the database manager.  
 
Data is input into the database as it is generated, normally on a daily basis.  Distinctions are 
made in the database for each different type of data (i.e. drill holes are distinguishable from 
channels, etc.).   Information stored in the database includes: 

Header information (ID, Surveys (collar and down hole), etc.); 
Tracking information (who entered the data, who logged the data, dates)    
Sample Type (core hole, RC hole, channel sample, grab sample) 
Assay results; and  
Geological log (core recovery, lithology, mineralization, and structure). 

 
The assay information comes directly from the lab in an electronic format and is merged into the 
database using sample numbers or IDs.   Once the lab has finalized assays they are put into a 
dedicated directory on the network (this is done either by email, diskette, or manually over the 
network).  Every day, as data is being input, checks for new assay files are performed.  The 
database automatically detects new assay files and options exist for selecting those files (or 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 74 of 131 

assays) to be imported into the database.  This import process automatically checks for 
duplicates, missing sample IDs, or any other non-conforming assays (NC's).  All NC's are 
written to a file where they can be investigated.     
 
The database automatically generates several reports including: 

Drill hole Report; 
Main Channel Sample Report; 
Muck Daily Report; 
Muck Monthly Report; 
Muck Samples (Total by Heading); 
UG Face Channels by Heading; 
UG Face Geology; and 
Composite Reports. 

 
The database includes a compositor that allows the user to select individual samples and it 
calculates the length and composited gold, silver, and equivalent silver grades.  This allows the 
user to quickly calculate the average grades and thickness of intervals of interest.  This can be 
printed out in a report format.  The database includes an option to input gold and silver prices 
and recoveries for calculation of equivalent values.  Since these are factors that change over time 
the equivalent values are not a permanently stored item, nor are they exportable.     
 
The database includes exporting capabilities of all data stored.  It exports data to a format that is 
directly importable to the company's Gemcom Mine Planning software.  The export format is an 
excel spreadsheet so all data is also readily importable for use in spreadsheets or a different 
database. 
 
Senior project personnel have portable versions of the database on their laptop computers.  This 
allows them access to the data at all times.  The portable databases are only up-to-date to the 
point that the master database is copied onto the laptop.  No data entry is allowed on the portable 
version.  Policy dictates that the database is only copied from the Master to the portable.  
Copying from the portable to the Master is not allowed.  This ensures the integrity of the Master 
database. 
 
The author has not personally verified all the data but has relied upon the data validation that is 
completed as part of the normal modeling and resource and reserve estimation process done by 
experienced professionals.  The data verification is restricted to that data which is within current 
resource and reserve models.   
 
In 2007, implementation of a new database system (AcQuire) commenced for all exploration 
conducted by Coeur and CMCB. The goal of this program is to provide secure backup to the 
corporate office, standardize the data management structure at all exploration and production 
sites and provide a standardized set of tools for data QAQC and reporting.

SECTION 16 – MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
Average mill recoveries during 2007 were 91.6% for gold and 93.8% for silver.  This is based on 
a blended mineral feed from Cerro Bayo, Laguna Verde, Cascada and Mina Martha.   
 
Laboratory flotation tests have been carried out on the various mineral types.  The mineral blends 
were representative of the minerals and grades of the various veins.  The blends were tested with 
normal plant reagents X-350, A-3477, and MIBC. 
 
Results of 18 tests show good recovery of gold and silver using the normal plant reagents.  
Similar recoveries were obtained with SF-554, D-1012 and a mixture of foamers 
3MIBC+2D250+1D1012. The best results were obtained with X-350, A-25 and D-1012, with 
recoveries of 90.87 % gold and 94.86 % silver. 
 
The reagent mix corresponding to the best tests was varied and compared to the normal plant 
reagents.  This is shown in the summary of tests 19 through 22 and 23 through 26, respectively.  
Test 22 showed excellent recoveries of 92.12 % gold and 94.55 % silver. 
 
Finally a flotation feed of 75 % -200 mesh was tested (the normal feed size is 60 % -200 mesh).  
The results are shown in the summary of tests 29 through 31.  While there does not appear to be 
distinct trend for gold recovery, the recoveries appear to increase with normal plant reagents, but 
the recovery decreased for test 30.  The best effect corresponds to an increase in recovery for 
silver for all of the tests with the finer feed size.  Test results are listed in Table 24.

Mineral purchased from Mina Martha played an important role in the blending of plant feed 
through the end of 2007. During 2007, a processing plant was constructed at Mina Martha and, 
beginning in December 2007, mineral is no longer shipped from Mina Martha. 
 
Historical plant metallurgical results for the Martha minerals returned recoveries of 85% to 92% 
for gold and 92% to 95% for silver.  Concentration ratios ranged from 33 to 50:1 and are very 
dependant on accompanying metals such as copper, zinc, lead, and iron.   
 
A single flotation test has been done on the Martha oxidized mineral using the same reagents 
utilized in the Mill; AF-3477, Xantato 350, and MIBC.  The oxidized mineral appears to be 
harder, requiring 33 minutes to grind to the flotation testing size of 70% passing 200 mesh versus 
the sulfide material of 22 to 24 minutes.  Test recoveries of 85% for gold and 91% for silver 
were realized.  The concentration ratio was 45:1.

Mineral Reserves are reported at a cutoff grade of  6.00 EqAu gpt 
 
The estimates were prepared under the supervision of Gene E. Snider, Director of Technical 
Services for Coeur South America.  Mr. Snider and is satisfied with the quality of the processes 
employed and with the estimates.   
 
The criteria used to categorize Mineral Resources and Reserves are in accordance with Canadian 
National Instrument 43-101 STANDARDS OF DISCLOSURE FOR MINERAL PROJECTS 
(CIM 43-101) although CIM 43-101 does not set the actual reserve and resource standards. 
These include measured, indicated, and inferred resource, and proven and probable reserve 
categories.   
 
Historical extraction and production over the last five years at Cerro Bayo demonstrates its 
viability of mining.  All reserves consider the combined economic weight of both silver and 
gold.  In this manner, all reserves are quantified on an equivalent gold basis; however, metal 
grades are broken out into their respective silver and gold components for reporting purposes.  A 
complete description of equivalent metal calculations is included in Section 22. 
 
The mineral resource and reserve estimates are based on valid exploration data and are 
reasonably estimated using standard engineering practices.  There are no known issues that 
would materially affect the reported resources and reserves. 
 
The following is a description of the classification of mineral reserves and mineral resources. 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 79 of 131 

 
Measured Resources   Mineral resources that fall in the Measured category include all resources 
within the geologic model that meet the statistical measured resource criteria and meet the cutoff 
grade associated with the most likely extraction method (open pit or underground). This 
classification represents the highest degree of confidence in the material being estimated. 
 
Indicated Resources   Mineral resources that fall in the Indicated category include all resources 
within the geologic model that meet the statistical indicated resource criteria and meet the cutoff 
grade associated with the most likely extraction method (open pit or underground).  This material 
is associated with a lower degree of geologic confidence. 
 
Inferred Resources   Mineral resources that fall in the inferred category include all resources 
within the geologic model that meet the statistical inferred resource criteria and meet the cutoff 
grade associated with the most likely extraction method (open pit or underground).  This material 
is associated with the lowest degree of geologic confidence.   
 
Resource Note Mineral Resources are reported in addition to reserves.  No material reported as a 
Mineral reserve has been included in Mineral resources. 
 
Proven Reserves   Mineral Reserves that fall in the proven category include all Measured 
Resources within the mine design that meet the design cutoff grade. This classification provides 
the highest degree of confidence at Cerro Bayo to return a positive cash flow.  Proven reserves 
represent the zones located on consistently mineralized structures throughout the deposit that 
have been mapped, sampled and drilled to leave no reasonable doubt of economic viability.  
Dilution has been included as well as losses expected during mining. 
 
Probable Reserves   Mineral Reserves that fall in the probable category include all Indicated 
Resources within the mine design that meet the design cutoff grade. This classification still 
represents a high degree of confidence in the material being estimated, but is associated with 
sparser sampling than the proven reserves.  Dilution has been included as well as losses expected 
during mining. 
 
Resource classification was established from univariate statistics and spatial relationship 
(samples used & anisotropic distance).  This evaluation was completed for gold grade estimation 
only.  Classifications were assigned to each block in the model based on the number of samples 
used to estimate each block and the anisotropic distance to the nearest sample.  The classification 
parameters for the models are listed in Table 28. 

Resource and Reserve Modeling 
 
Cerro Bayo reports an undiluted resource. Two distinct grade models may be created for veins 
with Gemcom software.  The models which are described in more detail below are: 
2-D model; and  
3-D model. 
 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 80 of 131 

Each series involves estimating silver and gold models and then creating an equivalent gold 
grade model through simple calculations involving the silver and gold models. 

Density 
 
CDE Chilean evaluated the densities of all the major veins in the Fachinal District.  A total of 
270 samples were tested.  An average density of 2.64 g/cc was determined.  

2-D Models 
 
Cerro Bayo has used 2D models to estimate resources and reserves in veins.  2D models are 
block models in which the data is projected to a vertical section along the strike of the vein.  The 
estimation parameters required, such as search radius, minimum and maximum number of 
composites, categories, and block size are determined with the same methods as in the 3D 
models.  Grades are composited into a single composite driven by the vein intercept.  Vein 
intercepts are based on geologic rock codes provided at the time of logging.  The horizontal 
width of the vein is calculated with a formula that relates vein strike and dip with hole azimuth 
and inclination.       
A horizontal width is estimated for each block exactly as gold and silver grades are estimated.  
Tonnes are estimated using the horizontal width of the structure and the remaining two 
dimensions (length and height) of the block.  This means that no solid is constructed to estimate 
volumes in 2D models. 
 
With the estimation parameters defined, an in-situ (undiluted) model is generated utilizing 
inverse distance methods.  A horizontal width and a gold and silver grade are estimated.   
 
A diluted model is then generated by replacing the estimated block width with a minimum 
mining width of 1.2 meters.  For blocks with horizontal widths greater than the minimum mining 
width, 0.20 m of dilution is added.  Dilution is applied at zero grade.  Final estimation is 
calculated from the Excel spreadsheet. 

3-D Models 
 
The Geologic model incorporates surface and underground mapping, and exploration drill hole 
and channel sample interpolation into a final geologic model that includes lithological, structural, 
and mineralogical information.  This information is plotted and modeled on both plan and 
section prior to being digitized into Gemcom software for solid creation.  
 
Geologic interpretations are digitized into Gemcom as 3-D rings.  Prior to creating the solid, the 
rings are snapped to actual composites based on interpreted rock codes.  The two sets of rings 
(plan and section) are then used to create valid geologic solids.  This method has a very high 
degree of accuracy for solid creation.   

The geologic vein solids, constructed as described above and completely validated, are used to 
select and composite the data.  Regular composites, defined by the geologic solids, are created 
from drill hole and channel sample information.  This data, in addition to being used for 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 81 of 131 

statistical purposes, is utilized to estimate a three dimensional computerized grade model for 
both gold and silver with Gemcom software. 
 
3-D block models for both gold and silver grades are estimated by inverse distance methods 
using the statistical results and estimation parameters listed above.  Previous engineering 
reviews, statistical analysis, and estimation parameters provided by Magri Consultores Limitada 
(MCL), The Winters Company (TWC), Snowden, Micron International, and John Sims (Senior 
Geologist Coeur d'Alene Mines) are incorporated in the resource and reserve estimations.   

Statistical Analysis 
 
Statistics from each individual vein were analyzed.  Analysis consisted of both raw data and 
composited data review.  Results of the statistical analysis for the models are summarized in 
Table 27. 
 

Grade Estimation 
 
All models were estimated using an inverse distance method.  Previous engineering reviews, 
statistical analysis, and parameters provided by Magri Consultores Limitada (MCL), Mr. John 
Sims – Senior Geologist Coeur d'Alene Mines, The Winters Company (TWC), Snowden, and 
Micon International are incorporated in the resource and reserve calculations.  Block model 
parameters are shown in Table 28.  Final estimation parameters used for the models are listed in 
Table 29.

Mineral Resources 
 
Both 3-D and 2-D models were utilized for reporting resources.  To eliminate possible 
duplication of reserve volume and grades, the mining design solids were used to select and 
initialize to zero blocks that fell within the solid.  Remaining blocks were used to report 
resources.  Resources are reported in-situ and do not include dilution. 

Mineral Reserves 
 
Both 2D and 3D models were utilized for reporting reserves.  Mining solids or excavation solids 
were created utilizing the geologic solids, drill hole information, block grades, and operational 
issues such as minimum mining widths and mining methods.  Stope outlines are constructed on 
vertical sections and excavation solids are created.  Reserves were reported using the mine 
design solids for volumetric and grade calculations. Mining dilution is determined by adding 
dilution at 0 gpt to a vein width of 1.2 m if the vein is less than 1.2m thick and by adding 0.2m to 
the vein width if the vein is greater than 1.2 m thick. Mining recovery ranges from 90 to 95% of 
the contained ounces. 

Divisor and Equivalent Gold Model 
 
After satisfactory completion of the silver and gold models, an equivalent gold model is created 
in Gemcom software using design parameters for metals price and recovery.  Cerro Bayo uses a 
"silver divisor" to convert silver assays to an equivalent gold grade.  This calculation is shown 
below. 
 

Silver divisor      = (Gold price/oz) * (Au Rec)  = ($600/oz * 88.98%)           = 52.80 
(Silver price/oz) * (Ag Rec)   ($11.00/oz * 91.93%) 

 
Recoveries are average final payable recoveries for Cerro Bayo mineral types.  This divisor is 
used to create the equivalent gold grade model with the following equation: 
 

Equivalent Gold (AuEq gpt) = Gold (Au gpt) + [Silver (Ag gpt) / Divisor]. 
 
 
 
There are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, 
political, or other relevant issues that would materially affect these mineral resources and 
reserves. 
 
There are no known mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, or other relevant factors that would 
materially affect these resources and reserves.

SECTION 20 – RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The Cerro Bayo operation shows significant economic viability. The mine plan and economic 
evaluation included in Section 22 demonstrate this viability. It is recommended to continue both 
exploration and operation activities at Cerro Bayo as discussed in Section 10 and Section 22. 
 
It is the Qualified Person's opinion that the character and economic viability of the property is of 
sufficient merit to justify the recommended program of continued exploration and operation.

SECTION 22 – ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS ON 
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES 

Royalties 
 
No royalties are paid by CMCB at this time.   

Tax obligations 

Tax on Profits 
 
As of June 30, 2007, CMCB has an accumulated tax loss of US$ 22,071,878.  CMCB will not be 
paying any taxes on profits until this loss is completely offset.  CMCB has entered into an 
agreement under Chilean law D.L. No. 600 where by CMCB's profits can be taxed at the agreed 
rate of 42% at its maximum, once the loss is exhausted." 

Value added tax or (IVA) 
 
CMCB pays a value added tax of 19% on all equipment, supplies, parts and services.  These 
taxes are exempt for the production of export products.  CMCB exports 100% of its production 
and therefore receives a refund for practically all of the tax payments.   

Employer tax (Severance Insurance) 
 
CMCB pays between 2.4 and 3% on gross salaries up to a taxable wage maximum of 90 UF 
(unidad de fomento) per each employee. Each UF equals 18,336 on current Chilean pesos.  
CMCB incurs a cost of approximately US$160,000 per year on this tax. 

Professional Services tax 
 
CMCB retains 10% and forwards to the Chilean IRS 10% on all services rendered by outside 
professionals.  

Mining claims 
 
CMCB pays approximately US$158,500 annually to retain all its mining claims.  This amount is 
due in March each year. 

Reclamation Bonding 
 
CMCB has an obligation to post a bond for tailings dam reclamation and remediation.  The cost 
of the bond is $15,000 per year plus a negotiable letter of credit for $1,200,000.   
 
 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 102 of 131 

Environmental Issues 
 
CMCB has all environmental permits required for current operations.   
 
The recent ABA analysis and wet cell test that have been conducted illustrated that there is a 
potential for acid rock drainage (ARD).  ARD potential is manageable but increases the closure 
cost and makes it necessary to take operational measures to control or avoid ARD.  
 
Hazardous substances such as diesel fuel and oil are handled on a daily basis.  These substances 
can contaminate the superficial or underground water supplies if spilled.  Waste oils are 
collected, treated, and disposed of by a licensed 3rd party. 
 
Airborne particles from the tailings dam could rise above required standards and force 
expenditures to correct the problem. 
 
The underground mines occasionally encounter areas of perched water that requires management 
and mitigation on a case by case basis. 
 
The tailings dam has a maximum of three years of capacity remaining.  Alternative areas are 
being reviewed for dam construction. 

Milling  
 
The Laguna Verde flotation plant was put back into production in April 2002.  313,313 metric 
tons of mineral were processed in 2002.  Partially oxidized mineral from Furioso was blended 
with sulfide minerals from Cerro Bayo and Mina Martha mineral from Argentina.  Gold 
recoveries for the year ran 86.69 % with silver recoveries at 90.33%.  Gold recoveries were 
lower than estimated in the mine plan due to the oxidized nature of the Furioso mineral.  Much 
of the year was spent testing flotation reagents to improve recoveries.  It was found that 
recoveries could be enhanced by lowering the concentration ratio.  Early startup experienced low 
recoveries with very high concentration ratios between 70 and 80:1.  Changing the concentration 
ratio to near 40:1 increased recoveries above 90% for both gold and silver. 
 
Several improvements were made to the plant in 2002 to improve recoveries.  These 
improvements were not completely implemented until the end of 2003.  A series of pump boxes 
were installed below the flotation cells that allows for flotation cell underflow to be pumped 
back to the flotation circuit to more than one feed point within the flotation circuit. This allows 
for further cleaning and enhances recovery.  The vertical flotation column was not operable 
when the plant began operations.  Repairs to the piping and valves were required.  The vertical 
column was put into operation toward the end of 2002 and an increase in flotation capacity and 
cleaner concentrate has resulted. 
 
Several improvements were made to the plant in 2003 to improve recoveries, the main 
improvement being the addition of a flash cell.  These improvements were implemented late in 
2003 and recoveries during the last months showed a noticeable improvement. 
 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 103 of 131 

All the improvements made to the plant during 2002 and 2003 resulted in the recoveries 
improving in 2004 to an average of 91.8% for gold and 94.2% for silver. 
 
Plant recoveries during 2006 averaged 91.8% for gold and 93.8% for silver. 

General Operating Structure 
 
The Laguna Verde mineral processing plant comprises a crushing, grinding and flotation facility 
with a design capacity of approximately 1500 mtpd. The plant produces a bulk sulphide 
concentrate containing gold and silver.   
 
The mill is outfitted with a CITEC control system.  This circuit was upgraded in 2002.  A 
simplified Mill flow sheet is shown in Figure 32. 

Crushing and Grinding 
 
Mineral is received from various mining areas and responds differently during milling.  Blending 
of the mineral is important to maintain maximum milling efficiencies, and therefore it is 
imperative that an active stockpile be maintained. 
 
Mineral is dumped directly into the 100 mt crusher dump pocket or to the stockpile as required.  
A front-end loader is available to work the stockpile to ensure consistent mill feed.  Mineral is 
extracted from the dump pocket via a 1,520 mm x 6,500 mm apron feeder and dumped into a 
1,070 mm x 1,220 mm (42" x 48") jaw crusher.  Material less than 150 mm (6") is transported 
via 2 conveyors (600 mm & 900 mm) to a 1,500 mt (approximately 1,000 mt of "live" capacity) 
bin.  
 
Mineral is reclaimed from the coarse bin with a vibrating feeder that discharges to a 900 mm 
conveyor belt.  The belt transports the mineral to a semi-autogenous grinding ("SAG") mill (5.5 
m x 2.8 m) with a 1,000 kW drive.  The unit is equipped with an internal re-circulating trommel 
to return the oversize material to the mill.  Minus 10 mm material flows into a pump box, where 
it is combined with ball mill discharge and pumped to the 382 mm diameter grinding cyclones. 
Cyclone underflow flows to the 3,500 mm x 5,640 mm (3.5 m x 5.6 m) ball mill equipped with a 
1,000 kW motor, where feed is ground to 60% minus 200 mesh product size (P80 –130 microns).

Flotation and Drying 
 
This process constitutes two sectors, the first of which takes place on the over-size from the 
classifier in the ball mill return line.  Before returning to the ball mill, the oversized material 
enters a flotation flash cell.  This flash cell recovers 45 to 65% of the total floatable gold and 40 
to 50% floatable silver. 
 
The second sector consists of the overflow from the cyclones mentioned earlier.  This flotation 
circuit consists of a single flotation line comprising a rougher/scavenger circuit, followed by 
regrinding, further treatment in a column cell, and finished with two more stages of cleaner 
flotation. 
 
The rougher circuit consists of four 14.2 m3 rougher cells followed by two 14.2 m3 rougher-
scavenger cells.  The scavenger tails are the final mill tailings.  The scavenger concentrate is 
recycled to the head circuit and the concentrate from the rougher is re-ground prior to cleaning. 
The regrind mill is a vertical mill (VTM- 400WB) that reduces the concentrate to 95% minus 
400 mesh (P80 –15 microns) working in a closed circuit with a 150 mm cyclone.  Cyclone 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 105 of 131 

overflow reports to the cleaning circuit.  Concentrate from 1st & 2nd cleaner report to the column 
cell, which was installed in May 2000. 
 
The column cell (115 mm dia x 10 m high) tails are recycled to the cleaning circuit.  Column cell 
product is the final concentrate. 
 
The concentrate dewatering circuit consists of a 9 m diameter thickener, a 4 m diameter x 4 m 
high agitated stock tank and two Larox pressure filters.  Typically only one filter is required, 
while the second one is on standby.  The filtered concentrate drops from the filters into the 
concentrate load out area. 

Flash Cell 
 
This flotation cell has the capability to process pulps up to ¼", which is not possible with 
conventional cells.  The actual flash cell is a Gallagher 150 ft3, modified so that its 
hydrodynamics are not affected and it can eliminate the over-sized particles. 
 
The main principal of the flash cell is to recover gold and silver values from over-size from the 
cyclones before it returns to the ball mill.  This oversized material has floatable gold and silver, 
but because of inefficiencies in the cyclone and/or its specific gravity, it does not report to the 
cyclone fines.  To eliminate re-grinding of this material by the ball mill, the flash cell was 
installed and increases recovery of both gold and silver by 1.5 to 2%. 

Tailings Disposal 
 
The rougher-scavenger tails are the final tailings from the mill.  Tailings flow by gravity in a 200 
mm diameter HDPE pipeline to the tailings pond.  Currently the tailings dam has sufficient 
capacity for an additional one to two years based on full mill utilization.  Engineering 
evaluations are under-way for a new tailings impoundment. 
 
The pipeline extends along the tailing dam wall to a cluster of skid-mounted hydro-cyclones 
where the coarse fraction is removed and used for dam construction, and the fine fraction with 
most of the water directed to the pond. 
 
Water is reclaimed from the pond by barge-mounted pumps as a source of water for the mill. 
Makeup is provided by fresh water from the General Carrera Lake as required. 

Mill Maintenance 
 
Preventative maintenance programs are in place and is scheduled according to production 
(tonnes of mineral milled).  Maintenance is performed each month at least two days at the end of 
the month and two days at the beginning of the month.  This allows the plant crews to ship all 
concentrates to the port of Chacabuco as well as calculate the monthly metal production.  
Computerized maintenance and warehousing systems are in place.

Mine Design 
 
Mining methods to be utilized for extracting the mineral reserve include: 

Shrinkage stoping;  
Cut & Fill stoping; and  
Long Hole stoping. 

Underground 
 
Final underground stopes have been designed using either 3-D or 2-D modeling methods.  In 3-D 
models, mining solids or excavation solids are created utilizing the geologic solids, drill hole and 
channel sampling information, and operational issues such as minimum mining widths and 
mining methods.  Stope outlines (3D rings) are constructed on both plan and vertical sections.  
Solids are created using 2 sets of 3D rings.  Reserves are reported using the mine design solids 
for volumetric and grade calculations.  A 2-D model is used as a first pass for stope design in 
some veins.  The basic concept behind this method is to convert the 3-D grade model into a two 
dimensional sectional profile.  In general, the 2-D model has the same geometry as the 3-D 
model with the exception of having only one column.  The mining stope is designed on the 
sectional view and considers minimum mining widths as well as geologic and grade features.  
Volumes and grades can be estimated once the stope outline has been designed.  This method 
provides a quick way of evaluating individual stopes. Underground mine reserves include 
dilution of 5% to 25% at zero grade. Mining recovery averages between 90% to 95%. 

Shrinkage Stoping 
 
Shrinkage stoping methods have been used very successfully at Cerro Bayo.  The stopes have the 
following general characteristics: 

Length              - 50 meters;  
Width              - 1.5 to 2 meters; 
Height             - 50 meters; and 
Dip              - 80 – 85 degrees. 

 
The two shrinkage design types that may be utilized consist of a haulage drift stope or an 
extraction chute stope.  The haulage drift design calls for a basal drift to be driven in the vein to 
the stope limits.  A parallel haulage drift is then driven with muck bays connecting the two every 
7 meters.  This method does not require any pillars or chutes and is more efficient for extraction 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 107 of 131 

purposes, but it requires significantly more development and time to develop.  Raise(s) driven to 
the ultimate height of the shrinkage stope provide access and ventilation to the stopes.  Normally 
100% extraction of the stope is achievable.  This is the method utilized in the larger, more 
continuous veins such as Javiera. 
 
The extraction chute design calls for a basal drift to be driven at the lower level of the stope.  A 
sub-level is then driven leaving a 1 to 2 meter pillar.  Small raises are then driven up to the sub-
level every 7 meters and wooden chutes installed.  Raise(s) driven to the ultimate height of the 
shrinkage stope provide access and ventilation to the stopes.  This method reduces development 
meters and time, but is less efficient for extraction as chute hang-ups are normal.   Normally 
100% extraction of the stope is achievable, but this depends on the ability to recover the pillars 
after the stope has been extracted.  This method was used very successfully in the Taitao 
underground mine.   
 
Shrinkage levels are drilled to a 2.5 meter depth.  Geologic control is given for each lift and 
controls the dimension of the stope.  Back channel samples are taken every other lift for grade 
control.  Additional grab and channel sampling is done on an as-needed basis for grade control. 
Dilution added to the shrinkage reserves include 100% of low grade within the mine solid plus 
and additional 10% to 25% of the total volume at zero grade.  The dilution depends on the vein 
width in the stope.  Losses of 5% are considered. 

Cut and Fill Stoping 
 
Cut and Fill stoping methods have been successfully used at Cerro Bayo.  The stopes have the 
following general characteristics: 
 

Length            - 50 to 100 meters; 
Vein Cut - 0.50 meter minimum; 
Final Cut - 2.8 meters; and 
Height     - 15 meters. 

 
The cut and fill design calls for a basal drift to be driven at the lower level of the stope in the 
vein.  The back is then drilled to the full width of 2.8 meters, with hole patterns selectively 
placed within the vein.  A two pass blasting/mucking sequence then follows.  First the vein is 
blasted and the mineral mucked out.  Following extraction of the mineral, the wall rock that was 
previously drilled in conjunction with the vein is blasted.  This material becomes the fill 
material, allowing access to the following cut.  Final blasted width is determined by cut and fill 
balances to minimize extra fill material required from other sources.     
 
Cut and Fill levels are drilled to a 2.5 meter depth.  Geologic control is given for each lift and 
controls the dimension of the stope.  Back channel samples are taken every other lift for grade 
control.  Additional grab and channel sampling is done on an as-needed basis for grade control. 
Dilution added to the cut and fill reserves include 0.20 meters in width at zero grade.  Losses of 
5% are considered. 
 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 108 of 131 

Cut and fill methods have been successful on very narrow veins that will not support shrinkage 
stoping due to extreme amounts of dilution associated with 1.20 meter minimum mining widths.  
Since a very narrow (0.50 meter) cut is achievable, dilution is significantly less than shrinkage 
stoping. 

Long Hole Stoping 
 
Long hole stoping has been successfully used in the Cerro Bayo underground mine.  This method 
will be used in appropriate areas due to faster extraction and cheaper mining costs. A mining 
dilution of 30% is used for long hole stopes in the Cascada area and 20% for all other long hole 
stopes. 

Development Requirements 
Development of approximately 8,320 meters per year is required. 
 

Grade Control Standard Operating Procedure 
 
The Geology Department is responsible for all sampling and grade control.  The Mine 
Department is responsible for defining and designing economical mineral blocks or stopes.  In 
order to assure that this work is carried out as efficiently as possible, a standard operating 
procedure has been established, which is described below. 

A combination of surface diamond drill holes and underground channel samples are employed at 
the mine in order to estimate the resource/reserve block grades for underground mining.   All 
sampling is managed by the Geology department.  Geology works as part of the planning team 
along with the Mine Planning department to define individual blocks that collectively constitute 
the production program for a specific sector.  This work is called "Area Block Calculation", and 
the outcome will vary depending upon geologic and operational parameters. 

Each economically minable vein, as previously defined by the Planning Group, is channel 
sampled perpendicular to the strike of the vein on 3 meter centers in underground and 5 meter 
centers in open pit benches. Composite samples are taken at contacts of changing lithology.  
Care is taken to define the mineral/waste contacts.  Once assays are obtained the mine geologist 
marks the width of the vein to be drilled and blasted.  Red paint defines the vein on both the foot 
wall and hanging wall side of the vein.  A shift foreman insures that the contractor drills the 
veins within the boundaries of the vein to minimize dilution.   

Each vein is geological mapped at a scale of 1:250 for the underground and open pit mines. 
Features mapped include mineralised structures, alteration, lithology and all structural features 
including faults, joints, etc.  All of the mapping data is recorded on plan views, cross sections, 
and longitudinal sections and updated periodically for geological control and modelling.  
Mapping and channel sampling are used for control at the operating underground and open pit 
mines. Channels are marked and described by the mine geologists.  Face and back channels are 
cut along vein developments to estimate the grade of the mineral.  Additional blasted mineral 
samples from every round are taken to compare with the channel samples. Mineral removed 



Coeur d'Alene Mines – Cerro Bayo Technical Report January 1, 2008 
Page 109 of 131 

from headings is stockpiled outside the portal.  Labels are placed on each round to indicate the 
heading, date and grade of the broken mineral.   
 
Mineral control in stopes is controlled by channel sampling along the back.  Both in situ and 
diluted grades are estimated.  Sampling takes place on every other 2.5 meter vertical round 
blasted.  Survey control keeps record of volumes accumulated in the stope.  Grades are then 
estimated for the broken mineral that remains in the stope.  Average grades and widths of vein 
are kept for each lift.  Channel samples are surveyed and imported into the Master Access 
database, Gemcom, as well as Excel.  The information is used by the engineering department to 
determine the grade feed for the plant.   
 
Once the assay results are known, the mineral blocks that will be mined are defined and marked 
in the field in such a manner as to minimize dilution. 
 
The Geology Department supervises and controls the mining of each block of mineral as well as 
mineral stockpiling operations.  The Geology Department is also responsible for tracking the 
dilution that occurs during mining as compared to the original block estimate. 
 

Concentrate Sales 
 
Concentrates are sold under contract to private refiners. Current contracts are with DOWA 
Mining Company, Ltd. located in Japan and Met-Mex Peñoles SA de CV Mexico located in

Cutoff Grade 
 
All reserves are based on underground extraction methods. Due to the basically non-selective 
underground mining methods (shrinkage and long hole stoping), all material, including un-
economic material within the stope, must be mined.  The following general cutoff calculation is 
utilized.

Life of mine economics 
 
The proven and probable reserve has been considered in the mine plan and utilized to calculate 
mine economics.  Base case economic results are shown in Table 38. These results are backed by 
experience gained from over four years of operating and processing ore at CMCB.  
 
An economic sensitivity analysis was completed in which major economic inputs where varied 
plus and minus 10%.  The inputs that were evaluated included: 

Metals Price (gold and silver); 
Operating Costs; and 
Capital Costs. 

 
The CMCB economics are sensitive to metals price and operating cost fluctuations.  The results
